1232|"Nicolo Machiavelli, born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. From 1494 to 1512held an official post at Florence which included diplomatic missions tovarious European courts. Imprisoned in Florence, 1512; later exiled andreturned to San Casciano. Died at Florence on 22nd June 1527."|FALSE
1232|"INTRODUCTION"|FALSE
1232|"Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was thesecond son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were membersof the old Florentine nobility."|FALSE
1232|"His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularlyenough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history ofFlorence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as anItalian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de' Medici, Il Magnifico.The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which yearMachiavelli entered the public service. During his official careerFlorence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasteduntil 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost hisoffice. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when theywere once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli's literaryactivity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks ofthe expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighthyear, without having regained office."|FALSE
1232|"YOUTH -- Aet. 1-25--1469-94"|FALSE
1232|"Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, theFlorence of those days is so well known that the early environment ofthis representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has beendescribed as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed bythe fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-lovingLorenzo. Savonarola's influence upon the young Machiavelli must havebeen slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over thefortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject ofa gibe in \"The Prince,\" where he is cited as an example of an unarmedprophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Mediceanrule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavellistrongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is toLorenzo's grandson that he dedicates \"The Prince.\""|FALSE
1232|"Machiavelli, in his \"History of Florence,\" gives us a picture of theyoung men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: \"They were freerthan their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in otherkinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak withwit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverlywas thought the wisest.\" In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli showswhy youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leadsus to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: \"Ihave received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, thanwhich I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, andto me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do yourshare.\" Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: \"This will turnout well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, youhave no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters andmusic, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill Ihave. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring successand honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help youif you help yourself.\""|FALSE
1232|"OFFICE -- Aet. 25-43--1494-1512"|FALSE
1232|"The second period of Machiavelli's life was spent in the service of thefree Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, fromthe expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. Afterserving four years in one of the public offices he was appointedChancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Libertyand Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events ofMachiavelli's life, for during this time he took a leading part inthe affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records,and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mererecapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen andsoldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, andsupplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characterswhich illustrate \"The Prince.\""|FALSE
1232|"His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \"my lady of Forli\" of\"The Prince,\" from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that itis far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely onfortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and isurged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes."|FALSE
1232|"In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII forcontinuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conductof affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraftsummarized in \"The Prince,\" and was consequently driven out. He, also,it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of supportto Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urgethat such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning thefaith of princes."|FALSE
1232|"Machiavelli's public life was largely occupied with events arising outof the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, theDuke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of \"The Prince.\"Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for thebenefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; hecan, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of CesareBorgia's conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics asthe \"hero\" of \"The Prince.\" Yet in \"The Prince\" the duke is in point offact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, andfalls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from aprudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for alleventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilitiesfail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but anextraordinary and unforeseen fatality."|FALSE
1232|"On the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watchthe election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheatedinto allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere(Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fearthe duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says thathe who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget oldinjuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruinedCesare."|FALSE
1232|"It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiffwas commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to asuccessful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chieflyto his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius thatMachiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, andconcludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will winand hold them both."|FALSE
1232|"It is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italianstates, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with thoseevents, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as theyimpinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings withLouis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch's character hasalready been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon asthe man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, butwho in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have beenruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting menof the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; butMachiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secretof his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, withoutforce of character--ignoring the human agencies necessary to carryhis schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of hiswishes."|FALSE
1232|"The remaining years of Machiavelli's official career were filled withevents arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between thethree great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with theobject of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained inthe battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won ineight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during theseevents, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out betweenthe pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated theentire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formedthe Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swissdrove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope,and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici shouldbe restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for thedismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to hispublic career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office."|FALSE
1232|"LITERATURE AND DEATH -- Aet. 43-58--1512-27"|FALSE
1232|"On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks hadvainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, wasdismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he wasaccused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at SanCasciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In aletter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has lefta very interesting description of his life at this period, whichelucidates his methods and his motives in writing \"The Prince.\" Afterdescribing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, hewrites: \"The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; atthe entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed Ipass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovinglyreceived by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where Ido not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of theiractions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours Ifeel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.And because Dante says:"|FALSE
1232|"     Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,     Unfruitful else,"|FALSE
1232|"I have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and havecomposed a small work on 'Principalities,' where I pour myself outas fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what aprincipality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, howthey can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies everpleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate itto his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he willbe able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had withhim; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\""|FALSE
1232|"The \"little book\" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the formin which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at workduring its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for someunknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici. AlthoughMachiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent orpresented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzoever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli anyemployment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli's lifetime,\"The Prince\" was never published by him, and its text is stilldisputable."|FALSE
1232|"Machiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \"And as to this littlething [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during thefifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neitherslept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one whohas reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my loyalty nonecould doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn howto break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannotchange his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty.\""|FALSE
1232|"Before Machiavelli had got \"The Prince\" off his hands he commenced his\"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,\" which should be readconcurrently with \"The Prince.\" These and several minor works occupiedhim until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to lookafter the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 theMedicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions toher citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a newconstitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but onone pretext or another it was not promulgated."|FALSE
1232|"In 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavellito settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chieflyremarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where hewas much sought after, and also for the production of his \"Art of War.\"It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instanceof Cardinal de' Medici to write the \"History of Florence,\" a taskwhich occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may havedetermined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writerobserves that \"an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, willendeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to playwith.\""|FALSE
1232|"When the \"History of Florence\" was finished, Machiavelli took it toRome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de' Medici, who had inthe meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhatremarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written \"The Prince\" forthe instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power inFlorence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \"History of Florence\" to thehead of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year thebattle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis Ia prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followedby the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party atFlorence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished."|FALSE
1232|"Machiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened hisreturn, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \"Ten ofLiberty and Peace.\" Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reachedFlorence, where he died on 22nd June 1527."|FALSE
1232|"THE MAN AND HIS WORKS"|FALSE
1232|"No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florencehas decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of hermost famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may havefound in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and thegerms of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idleto protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine whichthis sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and thatthe researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him morereasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \"unholynecromancer,\" which so long haunted men's vision, has begun to fade."|FALSE
1232|"Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, andindustry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, andwith his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforcedretirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is hedepicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination,the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have beenonly moderately prosperous in his several embassies and politicalemployments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren ofresults; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery thathe raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of hisown affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by theside of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromisinghimself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, andGiuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him towrite the \"History of Florence,\" rather than employ him in the state.And it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, thatwe find no weakness and no failure."|FALSE
1232|"Although the light of almost four centuries has been focused on \"ThePrince,\" its problems are still debatable and interesting, because theyare the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such asthey are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli's contemporaries; yet theycannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europerely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical incidentsand personages become interesting by reason of the uses whichMachiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government andconduct."|FALSE
1232|"Leaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnishsome European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, \"ThePrince\" is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Menare still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in thedays of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the viceswhich Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish themto be--and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then--to pass toa higher plane--Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may winan empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, andthe arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but tofight."|FALSE
1232|"It is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli's that governmentshould be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring thepeople with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society;to this \"high argument\" \"The Prince\" contributes but little. Machiavellialways refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise thanas he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that hiswork is of abiding value. But what invests \"The Prince\" with more thana merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truththat it deals with the great principles which still guide nations andrulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours."|FALSE
1232|"In translating \"The Prince\" my aim has been to achieve at all costs anexact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphraseadapted to the modern notions of style and expression. Machiavelli wasno facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged himto weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, hismanner nobly plain and serious. \"Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundisrebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?\" In \"The Prince,\" it maybe truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, butfor the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare's timethe translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easytask, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembledthat of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not sosimple. To take a single example: the word \"intrattenere,\" employed byMachiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towardsthe weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctlyrendered \"entertain,\" and every contemporary reader would understandwhat was meant by saying that \"Rome entertained the Aetolians and theAchaeans without augmenting their power.\" But to-day such a phrase wouldseem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to saythat \"Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians,\" etc.,using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve thepithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolutefidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I canonly hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author'smeaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it."|FALSE

1232|"I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states,and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than newones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of hisancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for aprince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless hebe deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if heshould be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to theusurper, he will regain it."|FALSE

For thehereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence ithappens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices causehim to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will benaturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and durationof his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, forone change always leaves the toothing for another."|FALSE

1232|"But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it benot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, takencollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly froman inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; formen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and thishope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein theyare deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they havegone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and commonnecessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who havesubmitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardshipswhich he must put upon his new acquisition."|FALSE
1232|"In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured inseizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friendswho put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in theway they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armedforces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwillof the natives."|FALSE
1232|"For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupiedMilan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time itonly needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened thegates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of futurebenefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It isvery true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, withlittle reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish thedelinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in theweakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it wasenough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders;but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bringthe whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated anddriven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned."|FALSE
1232|"     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco     Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. He ruled over Milan     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510."|FALSE
1232|"Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the secondtime. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remainsto name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and whatany one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself moresecurely in his acquisition than did the King of France."|FALSE
1232|"Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to anancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same countryand language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them,especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; andto hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of theprince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in otherthings the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will livequietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, andNormandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless thecustoms are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongstthemselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has onlyto bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of theirformer lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws northeir taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will becomeentirely one body with the old principality."|FALSE
1232|"But when states are acquired in a country differing in language,customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and greatenergy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most realhelps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has madethat of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measurestaken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, wouldnot have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disordersare seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if oneis not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then onecan no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillagedby your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to theprince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, andwishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that statefrom the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the princeresides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatestdifficulty."|FALSE
1232|"The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to dothis or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. Aprince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense hecan send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only ofthe citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the newinhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered,are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easilykept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear itshould happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. Inconclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are morefaithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, beingpoor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that menought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avengethemselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot;therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such akind that one does not stand in fear of revenge."|FALSE
1232|"But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends muchmore, having to consume on the garrison all the income from thestate, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more areexasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shiftingof the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, andall become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on theirown ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, suchguards are as useless as a colony is useful."|FALSE
1232|"Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respectsought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerfulneighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking carethat no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, geta footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will beintroduced by those who are discontented, either through excess ofambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans werebrought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country wherethey obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And theusual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner entersa country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatredwhich they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to thosesubject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over tohimself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he hasacquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold oftoo much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, andwith their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them,so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does notproperly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, andwhilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles."|FALSE
1232|"The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely thesemeasures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*)the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down thegreater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans andAetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia washumbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans andAetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nordid the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friendswithout first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make themagree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because theRomans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, forwhich they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it iseasy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicineis no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for ithappens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever,that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult todetect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected ortreated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult tocure. This it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arisehave been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), theycan be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen,they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them,there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles,dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let themcome to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is onlyto be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fightwith Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy;they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did thatever please them which is for ever in the mouths of the wise ones of ourtime:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits oftheir own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, andis able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good."|FALSE

Iwill not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get afoothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that everydoor was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced toaccept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeededvery quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made somemistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at oncethe authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentinesbecame his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, theBentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, ofRimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, theSienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend.

But he was no sooner inMilan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy theRomagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakeninghimself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrownthemselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding muchtemporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. Andhaving committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, somuch so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to preventhis becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come intoItaly."|FALSE

1232|"Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newlyacquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander theGreat became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst itwas scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the wholeempire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintainedthemselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which aroseamong themselves from their own ambitions."|FALSE
1232|"I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found tobe governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a bodyof servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by hisfavour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignityby antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such baronshave states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and holdthem in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a princeand his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in allthe country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, andif they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister andofficial, and they do not bear him any particular affection."|FALSE
1232|"The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and theKing of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord,the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, hesends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them ashe chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancientbody of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them;they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these awayexcept at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these stateswill recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk,but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of thedifficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurpercannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to beassisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has aroundhim. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, beingall slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, andone can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted,as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned.Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find himunited, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on therevolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routedin the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, thereis nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this beingexterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no creditwith the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before hisvictory, so he ought not to fear them after it."|FALSE
1232|"The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, becauseone can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render thevictory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet withinfinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and fromthose you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminatedthe family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselvesthe heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable eitherto satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time bringsthe opportunity."|FALSE
1232|"Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government ofDarius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, andtherefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him inthe field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory,Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for theabove reasons. And if his successors had been united they would haveenjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raisedin the kingdom except those they provoked themselves."|FALSE

And when fightingafterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himselfhis own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumedthere; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none otherthan the Romans were acknowledged."|FALSE
1232|"When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease withwhich Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties whichothers have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in theconqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state."|FALSE

Because such a government,being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand withouthis friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; andtherefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold itmore easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way."|FALSE

So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle manycities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain themotherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a cityaccustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to bedestroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of libertyand its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither timenor benefits will ever cause it to forget.

1232|"Let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalitiesas I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and ofstate; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, andfollowing by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely tothe ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wiseman ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitatethose who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equaltheirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the cleverarchers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too fardistant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bowattains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by theirstrength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid ofso high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach."|FALSE
1232|"I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there isa new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquiredthe state.

Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having noother state, is compelled to reside there in person."|FALSE

But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired orfounded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particulardeeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferiorto those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. And inexamining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anythingto fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mouldinto the form which seemed best to them. Without that opportunity theirpowers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powersthe opportunity would have come in vain."|FALSE

It was necessary that Cyrusshould find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes,and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace.

Thedifficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rulesand methods which they are forced to introduce to establish theirgovernment and its security. And it ought to be remembered that thereis nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, ormore uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introductionof a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemiesall those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarmdefenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arisespartly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, andpartly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in newthings until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happensthat whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack theydo it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wisethat the prince is endangered along with them."|FALSE

In thefirst instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything;but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarelyendangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and theunarmed ones have been destroyed.

On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called bythe people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy ofhis father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he hadtaken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise andable man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms andfortunes of others had bestowed on him."|FALSE

Firstly, he did not see hisway to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church;and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milanand the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini werealready under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw thearms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, inhands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsiniand the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore,to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to makehimself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for himto do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclinedto bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this,but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage ofKing Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance ofthe Venetians and the consent of Alexander.

The duke, therefore,having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing tohold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one,his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill ofFrance: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, whichhe was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinderhim from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, andthat the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warningwhen, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go veryunwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind whenhe himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and theking made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided todepend no more upon the arms and the luck of others."|FALSE
1232|"For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties inRome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to theirrank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a fewmonths all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirelyto the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini,having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to himsoon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that theaggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called ameeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion atUrbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke,all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restoredhis authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the Frenchor other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knewso well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of SignorPagolo--whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds ofattention, giving him money, apparel, and horses--the Orsini werereconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his powerat Sinigalia.(*) Having exterminated the leaders, and turned theirpartisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundationsto his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and thepeople now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained themall over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice, and to beimitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out."|FALSE

1232|"When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weakmasters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gavethem more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country wasfull of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishingto bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered itnecessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted MesserRamiro d'Orco,(*) a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullestpower. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with thegreatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was notadvisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt butthat he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in thecountry, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had theiradvocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused somehatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people,and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if anycruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in thenatural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro,and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza atCesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity ofthis spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed."|FALSE

1232|"But let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, findinghimself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediatedangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a greatmeasure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if hewished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, forhe knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would notsupport him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and totemporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards thekingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta. Itwas his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would havequickly accomplished had Alexander lived."|FALSE
1232|"Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the futurehe had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Churchmight not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that whichAlexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, byexterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so asto take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himselfall the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with theiraid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more tohimself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should diethat he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these fourthings, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he hadkilled as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, andfew had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had themost numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, heintended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugiaand Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longerto study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdomof Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buyhis goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Sienayielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear ofthe Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had hecontinued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died,for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would havestood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forcesof others, but solely on his own power and ability."|FALSE

And it is seen that his foundations weregood, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome,although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni,the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effectanything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished,at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. Butif he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,(*) everythingwould have been different to him. On the day that Julius the Second(+)was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that mightoccur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all,except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, hehimself would be on the point to die."|FALSE

Because he, having a lofty spirit andfar-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise,and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sicknessfrustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary tosecure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcomeeither by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by thepeople, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate thosewho have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of thingsfor new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroya disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kingsand princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offendwith caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of thisman."|FALSE
1232|"Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom hemade a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Popeto his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being electedPope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of anycardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they becamepontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred.

Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to havecreated a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented toRouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula.

This man, the son of apotter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamouslife. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability ofmind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being establishedin that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himselfprince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, thatwhich had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understandingfor this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, wasfighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senateof Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to theRepublic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators andthe richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedomof that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twicerouted by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only washe able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence,with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised thesiege of Syracuse.

Yet it cannot be called talentto slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, butnot glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into andextricating himself from dangers be considered, together with hisgreatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot beseen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinitewickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellentmen.

1232|"In our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto daFermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought upby his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of hisyouth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained underhis discipline, he might attain some high position in the militaryprofession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous bodyand mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearinga paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of somecitizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer thanits liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. Sohe wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for manyyears, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to lookupon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anythingexcept honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had notspent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would beaccompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and heentreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably bythe Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also tothat of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up."|FALSE

When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usualin such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain gravediscourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his sonCesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and othersanswered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to bediscussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber,whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. Nosooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places andslaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chiefmagistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obeyhim, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. Hekilled all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthenedhimself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, inthe year during which he held the principality, not only was hesecure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all hisneighbours.

I believe that thisfollows from severities(*) being badly or properly used. Those may becalled properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that areapplied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that arenot persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantageof the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstandingthey may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather thandecrease.

He who does otherwise, eitherfrom timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knifein his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attachthemselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. Forinjuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less,they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so thatthe flavour of them may last longer."|FALSE

1232|"CHAPTER IX -- CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY"|FALSE
1232|"But coming to the other point--where a leading citizen becomes theprince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,but by the favour of his fellow citizens--this may be called a civilprincipality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain toit, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a principalityis obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of thenobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found,and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled noroppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress thepeople; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities oneof three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy."|FALSE
1232|"A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles,seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputationof one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under hisshadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, findingthey cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one ofthemselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority.He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintainshimself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid ofthe people, because the former finds himself with many around him whoconsider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rulenor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popularfavour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are notprepared to obey him."|FALSE
1232|"Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object ismore righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added alsothat a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, becauseof their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself,as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from ahostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles hehas not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise againsthim; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, alwayscome forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from himwhom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is compelled to livealways with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles,being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take awayauthority when it pleases him."|FALSE
1232|"Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought tobe looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape theircourse in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they donot. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to behonoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealtwith in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and anatural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst inprosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, itis a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if theywere open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him."|FALSE
1232|"Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the peopleought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing theyonly ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition tothe people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, aboveeverything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he mayeasily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when theyreceive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound moreclosely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devotedto him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours;and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these varyaccording to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omitthem; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the peoplefriendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity."|FALSE

And do not let anyone impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \"He who builds onthe people, builds on the mud,\" for this is true when a private citizenmakes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people willfree him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates;wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to theGracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali(+) in Florence. But granteda prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and isa man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in otherqualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the wholepeople encouraged--such a one will never find himself deceived in them,and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well."|FALSE

In the latter case their governmentis weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwillof those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especiallyin troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, eitherby intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amidtumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens andsubjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not ofa mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be indoubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For such a princecannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens haveneed of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they allpromise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him;but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, thenhe finds but few. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous,inasmuch as it can only be tried once.

And to make this quiteclear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves bytheir own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raisea sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attackthem; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannotshow themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced todefend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has beendiscussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the secondcase one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provisionand fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed theother concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be oftenrepeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men arealways adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and itwill be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town wellfortified, and is not hated by his people."|FALSE

And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss tothe state, they always have the means of giving work to the communityin those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and onthe pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold militaryexercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them."|FALSE
1232|"Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himselfodious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will onlybe driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of thisworld are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a wholeyear in the field without being interfered with. And whoever shouldreply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt,they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest willmake them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful andcourageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at onetime hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at anothertime fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitlyfrom those subjects who seem to him to be too bold."|FALSE
1232|"Further, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruinthe country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot andready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the princeto hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damageis already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer anyremedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite withtheir prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now thattheir houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in hisdefence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits theyconfer as much as by those they receive.

Those aboutwhom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. Torestrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as itwas for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made useof the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini andColonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms intheir hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak andpowerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope,such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of theseannoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness;for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can withdifficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one peopleshould almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to theOrsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have timeto ruin the Orsini.

Such things Julius not only followed,but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin theVenetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of theseenterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not anyprivate person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions withinthe bounds in which he found them; and although there was among themsome mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: theone, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and theother, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused thedisorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinalsthey do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factionsin Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, andthus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults amongthe barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo(*) found thepontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made itgreat in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by hisgoodness and infinite other virtues."|FALSE

1232|"Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of suchprincipalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and havingconsidered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, andhaving shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them andto hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means ofoffence and defence which belong to each of them."|FALSE
1232|"We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have hisfoundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will goto ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old orcomposite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good lawswhere the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are wellarmed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussionand shall speak of the arms."|FALSE
1232|"I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his stateare either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holdshis state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe;for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither thefear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only solong as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in warby the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason forkeeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficientto make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to beyour soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they takethemselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little troubleto prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than byresting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although theyformerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yetwhen the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was thatCharles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk inhand;(*) and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told thetruth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I haverelated. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes whohave also suffered the penalty."|FALSE
1232|"     (*) \"With chalk in hand,\" \"col gesso.\" This is one of the     _bons mots_ of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with     which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only     necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the     billets for his soldiers to conquer the country. Cf. \"The     History of Henry VII,\" by Lord Bacon: \"King Charles had     conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind     of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of     Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope     Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into     Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,     rather than with swords to fight.\""|FALSE
1232|"I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. Themercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if theyare, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their owngreatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or otherscontrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you areruined in the usual way."|FALSE
1232|"And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to,either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go inperson and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send itscitizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, itought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws sothat he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes andrepublics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenariesdoing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring arepublic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizensthan it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stoodfor many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely armed andquite free."|FALSE

And if the Venetiansand Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yettheir captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them,I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance,for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, somehave not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned theirambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) andsince he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every onewill acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would havestood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him,so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy;Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us cometo that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed astheir captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a privateposition had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa,nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines tokeep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they hadno means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. TheVenetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to haveacted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men,when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This wasbefore they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fighton land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. Andin the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having muchterritory, and because of their great reputation, they had not muchto fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as underCarmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found hima most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership),and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, theyfeared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason theywere not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to loseagain that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order tosecure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for theircaptains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count ofPitigliano,(&) and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and notgain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,($) where in one battle theylost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so muchtrouble.

In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous;in auxiliaries, valour.

1232|"A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything elsefor his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is thesole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that itnot only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables mento rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it isseen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they havelost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglectthis art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master ofthe art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private personbecame Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships andtroubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among otherevils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, andthis is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guardhimself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionatebetween the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he whois armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or thatthe unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, therebeing in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possiblefor them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does notunderstand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes alreadymentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them.He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject ofwar, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than inwar; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study."|FALSE
1232|"As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men wellorganized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which heaccustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature oflocalities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleysopen out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers andmarshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledgeis useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, andis better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of theknowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease anyother which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; becausethe hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, forinstance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of othercountries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one caneasily arrive at a knowledge of others.

How should one bestadvance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,how ought we to pursue?\" And he would set forth to them, as he went, allthe chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinionand state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continualdiscussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpectedcircumstances that he could not deal with."|FALSE

And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, writtenby Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how thatimitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, andliberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written ofCyrus by Xenophon.

1232|"It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a princetowards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written onthis point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning itagain, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods ofother people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shallbe useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate tofollow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; formany have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have neverbeen known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how oneought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought tobe done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man whowishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets withwhat destroys him among so much that is evil."|FALSE
1232|"Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to knowhow to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, anddiscussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spokenof, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkablefor some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; andthus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscanterm (because an avaricious person in our language is still he whodesires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who depriveshimself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous,one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, anotherfaithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; oneaffable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere,another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous;one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that everyone will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince toexhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but becausethey can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for humanconditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficientlyprudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices whichwould lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, hemay with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he neednot make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices withoutwhich the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything isconsidered carefully, it will be found that something which looks likevirtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, whichlooks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity."|FALSE

1232|"Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I saythat it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberalityexercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it,injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should beexercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproachof its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men thename of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; sothat a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property,and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the nameof liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and doeverything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to hissubjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus,with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he isaffected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be thefirst danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back fromit, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly."|FALSE
1232|"Therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue ofliberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, ifhe is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for intime he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing thatwith his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himselfagainst all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises withoutburdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberalitytowards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meannesstowards those to whom he does not give, who are few."|FALSE
1232|"We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who havebeen considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second wasassisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet hedid not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King ofFrance; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax onhis subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his longthriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken orconquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. Aprince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that hecan defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that heis not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little accounta reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which willenable him to govern."|FALSE
1232|"And if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, andmany others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince infact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality isdangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated hisexpenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one shouldreply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spendsthat which is his own or his subjects' or else that of others. In thefirst case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglectany opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth withhis army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling thatwhich belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise hewould not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yoursnor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, andAlexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squanderthat of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own thatinjures you."|FALSE
1232|"And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilstyou exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either pooror despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And aprince should guard himself, above all things, against being despisedand hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser tohave a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality toincur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred."|FALSE

And if thisbe rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more mercifulthan the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty,permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as hekeeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach ofcruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than thosewho, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which followmurders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people,whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend theindividual only."|FALSE

It may be answered that one should wish tobe both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, itis much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must bedispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, thatthey are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long asyou succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is fardistant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And thatprince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected otherprecautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained bypayments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed beearned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be reliedupon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than onewho is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which,owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for theiradvantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which neverfails."|FALSE

But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life ofsomeone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the lossof their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property arenever wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will alwaysfind pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for takinglife, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse.

And short-sighted writers admirehis deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principalcause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have beensufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that mostexcellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose fromnothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers morelicense than is consistent with military discipline. For this he wasupbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter ofthe Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legatepunished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone inthe Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knewmuch better how not to err than to correct the errors of others.This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would havedestroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under thecontrol of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealeditself, but contributed to his glory."|FALSE

1232|"Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, andto live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experiencehas been that those princes who have done great things have held goodfaith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellectof men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied ontheir word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,(*) the oneby the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, thesecond to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, itis necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessaryfor a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and theman. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers,who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given tothe Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline;which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was halfbeast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to makeuse of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. Aprince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, oughtto choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himselfagainst snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves.Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and alion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do notunderstand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor oughthe to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, andwhen the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If menwere entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they arebad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observeit with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimatereasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examplescould be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been madevoid and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he whohas known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best."|FALSE

Alexander the Sixth did nothingelse but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and healways found victims; for there never was a man who had greater powerin asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet wouldobserve it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according tohis wishes,(*) because he well understood this side of mankind."|FALSE

It may be that the meaning attached to the word     \"fede\" was \"the faith,\" i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as     rendered here \"fidelity\" and \"faithful.\" Observe that the     word \"religione\" was suffered to stand in the text of the     Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of     belief, as witness \"the religion,\" a phrase inevitably     employed to designate the Huguenot heresy.

1232|"Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, Ihave spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discussbriefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as hasbeen in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make himhated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded hewill have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in otherreproaches."|FALSE
1232|"It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, fromboth of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor theirhonor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only tocontend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in manyways."|FALSE
1232|"It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince shouldguard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in hisactions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in hisprivate dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments areirrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one canhope either to deceive him or to get round him."|FALSE
1232|"That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered byhis people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reasona prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of hissubjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. Fromthe latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs willalways remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless theyshould have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even shouldaffairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations andhas lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resistevery attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did."|FALSE
1232|"But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he hasonly to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a princecan easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and bykeeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessaryfor him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the mostefficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is notto be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires againsta prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when theconspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not havethe courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confronta conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been theconspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspirescannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom hebelieves to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mindto a malcontent you have given him the material with which to contenthimself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that,seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the otherto be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or athoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you."|FALSE
1232|"And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the sideof the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect ofpunishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is themajesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends andthe state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things thepopular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as toconspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before theexecution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel tothe crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, andthus cannot hope for any escape."|FALSE
1232|"Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be contentwith one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. MesserAnnibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of thepresent Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who hadconspired against him, not one of his family survived but MesserGiovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassinationthe people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from thepopular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days inBologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after thedeath of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, havinginformation that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence,who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent toFlorence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it wasruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government."|FALSE

1232|"For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiraciesof little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when itis hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to feareverything and everybody.

1232|"Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, andin it are found many good institutions on which depend the libertyand security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and itsauthority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition ofthe nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouthswould be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing thehatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished toprotect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular careof the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would beliable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the peoplefor favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one whocould beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to theking. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, ora greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one candraw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairsof reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace intheir own hands.

Wishing, therefore,to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of theemperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not differentto those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit forconsideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies theaffairs of those times."|FALSE

1232|"There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities theambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to becontended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having toput up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so besetwith difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thingto give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the peopleloved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince,whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, andrapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exerciseupon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent totheir own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors werealways overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no greatauthority, and most of them, especially those who came new to theprincipality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little aboutinjuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princescannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, toavoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, theyought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of themost powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience hadneed of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than tothe people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them."|FALSE
1232|"From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, beingall men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and diedhonoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always keptboth orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nordespised."|FALSE
1232|"But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could notendure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contemptfor his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of hisadministration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired asmuch by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a princewishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when thatbody is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--itmay be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have tosubmit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will doyou harm."|FALSE

And because theactions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to showbriefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, whichnatures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate."|FALSE

On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear,elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained forSeverus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, twodifficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, hadcaused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west whereAlbinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered itdangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attackNiger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being electedemperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him andsent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had madeAlbinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled orientalaffairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus,little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, hadby treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he wascompelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, andtook from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefullyexamine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion anda most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one,and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, anew man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supremerenown always protected him from that hatred which the people might haveconceived against him for his violence."|FALSE
1232|"But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellentqualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people andacceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduringof fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, whichcaused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity andcruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless singlemurders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those ofAlexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by thosehe had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midstof his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-likedeaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperatecourage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fearto die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less becausethey are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injuryto those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state.Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed abrother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retainedin his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, andproved the emperor's ruin."|FALSE

He was a very warlikeman, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to thethrone. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hatedand despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which broughthim into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a greatindignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accessionto his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of theimperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocityby having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to angerat the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africarebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italyconspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, weredisgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found somany against him, murdered him."|FALSE
1232|"I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, beingthoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring thisdiscourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have thisdifficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in afar less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them someindulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies thatare veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as werethe armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessaryto give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now morenecessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy thepeople rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful."|FALSE
1232|"From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round himtwelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which dependthe security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep themhis friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in thehands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people,he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of theSoldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that itis like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either anhereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the oldprince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position bythose who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And thisbeing an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, becausethere are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in newones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state isold, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditarylord."|FALSE
1232|"But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever willconsider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has beenfatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also howit happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a numberin another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest tounhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous forPertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, whowas heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterlydestructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitatedSeverus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to treadin his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannotimitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to followthose of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts whichare necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are properand glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm."|FALSE

And although one cannot give a final judgment on allof these things unless one possesses the particulars of those statesin which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak ascomprehensively as the matter of itself will admit."|FALSE
1232|"2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; ratherwhen he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, byarming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrustedbecome faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and yoursubjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot bearmed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can behandled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which theyquite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger andservice should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarmthem, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, eitherfor cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinionsbreeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, itfollows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character alreadyshown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient todefend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore,as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has alwaysdistributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a princeacquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, thenit is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who havebeen his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time andopportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters shouldbe managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall beyour own soldiers who in your old state were living near you."|FALSE
1232|"3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomedto say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa byfortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of theirtributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a waybalanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a preceptfor to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in dividedcities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will alwaysassist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered theGuelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and althoughthey never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed thesedisputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by theirdifferences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did notafterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, oneparty at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never bepermitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one themore easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but ifwar comes this policy proves fallacious."|FALSE
1232|"4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome thedifficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and thereforefortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, whohas a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causesenemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may havethe opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by aladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider thata wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to fostersome animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renownmay rise higher."|FALSE
1232|"5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistancein those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted thanamong those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Princeof Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than byothers. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it variesso much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men whoat the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are ofa description to need assistance to support themselves, can always begained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held toserve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be verynecessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he hadformed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit fromthem than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglecthis affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn aprince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that hemust well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him whodid so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but onlydiscontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendlywith great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfythem. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples whichcan be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it iseasier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contentedunder the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than ofthose who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him andencouraged him to seize it."|FALSE
1232|"6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their statesmore securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bitto those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refugefrom a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made useof formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our timeshas been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that hemight keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning tohis dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to thefoundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered thatwithout them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivoglireturning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore,are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in oneway they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus:the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreignersought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreignersthan from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan,built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for thehouse of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reasonthe best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because,although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if thepeople hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assista people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in ourtimes that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to theCountess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed;for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and waitfor assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the postureof affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assistthe people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards whenCesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were alliedwith foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both thenand before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had thefortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise himwho builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blamewhoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people."|FALSE

A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the     appointment: \"I have been with the signori,\" wrote     Fortunati, \"to learn whom they would send and when. They     tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine     noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me     at once.\" Cf. \"Catherine Sforza,\" by Count Pasolini,     translated by P.

1232|"CHAPTER XXI -- HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN"|FALSE
1232|"Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and settinga fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the presentKing of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he hasrisen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be theforemost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deedsyou will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In thebeginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was thefoundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and withoutany fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castileoccupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring powerand authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church andof the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay thefoundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greaterschemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out andclearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirableexample, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus hisachievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the mindsof his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue ofthem. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other,that men have never been given time to work steadily against him."|FALSE
1232|"Again, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internalaffairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano,who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing someextraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method ofrewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And aprince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gainfor himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man."|FALSE
1232|"A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or adownright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, hedeclares himself in favour of one party against the other; which coursewill always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if twoof your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a characterthat, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not.In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declareyourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, ifyou do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey tothe conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has beenconquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything toprotect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not wantdoubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he wholoses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand,court his fate."|FALSE
1232|"Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to driveout the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends ofthe Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand theRomans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed inthe council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them tostand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which hasbeen said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state notto interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because bynot interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, theguerdon of the conqueror.\" Thus it will always happen that he who is notyour friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friendwill entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes,to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and aregenerally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favourof one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, althoughthe victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he isindebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men arenever so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressingyou. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must notshow some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you allyyourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able hemay aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again."|FALSE
1232|"In the second case, when those who fight are of such a character thatyou have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is itgreater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destructionof one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have savedhim; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with yourassistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be notedthat a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with onemore powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unlessnecessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you areat his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible beingat the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France againstthe Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, couldhave been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to theFlorentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, thenin such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one ofthe parties."|FALSE
1232|"Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safecourses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoidone trouble without running into another; but prudence consists inknowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice totake the lesser evil."|FALSE
1232|"A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honourthe proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage hiscitizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce andagriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not bedeterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken awayfrom him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but theprince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things anddesigns in any way to honour his city or state."|FALSE

1232|"CHAPTER XXII -- CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES"|FALSE
1232|"The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and theyare good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And thefirst opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, isby observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable andfaithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known howto recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they areotherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime errorwhich he made was in choosing them."|FALSE
1232|"There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant ofPandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo tobe a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because thereare three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third whichneither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first isthe most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore,it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, hewas in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good andbad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have theinitiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant,and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannothope to deceive him, and is kept honest."|FALSE
1232|"But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is onetest which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of hisown interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit ineverything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you everbe able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in hishands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, andnever pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned."|FALSE
1232|"On the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to studyhim, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing withhim the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that hecannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make himdread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other."|FALSE

1232|"I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for itis a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unlessthey are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, ofwhom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their ownaffairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved withdifficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves theyrun the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other wayof guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand thatto tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tellyou the truth, respect for you abates."|FALSE
1232|"Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing thewise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speakingthe truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, andlisten to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions.With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carryhimself in such a way that each of them should know that, the morefreely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside ofthese, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and besteadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrownby flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he fallsinto contempt."|FALSE
1232|"I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man ofaffairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to theabove; for the emperor is a secretive man--he does not communicate hisdesigns to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as incarrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they areat once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, beingpliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things hedoes one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what hewishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions."|FALSE

1232|"A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when hewishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every onefrom offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to bea constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning thethings of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on anyconsideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger befelt."|FALSE
1232|"And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impressionof his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the goodadvisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, becausethis is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wisehimself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded hisaffairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. Inthis case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long,because such a governor would in a short time take away his state fromhim."|FALSE

For the actions ofa new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditaryone, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bindfar tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by thepresent than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoyit and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of aprince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a doubleglory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned andstrengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a goodexample; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince,shall lose his state by want of wisdom."|FALSE

This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad tohave neglected all other expedients for that, since you would neverwish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on torestore you.

This opinion has been more credited in our timesbecause of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, andmay still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture.

I believe also thathe will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit ofthe times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times willnot be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the endwhich every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get thereby various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force,another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each onesucceeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see oftwo cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly,two men by different observances are equally successful, the one beingcautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else thanwhether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.This follows from what I have said, that two men working differentlybring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attainshis object and the other does not."|FALSE

Therefore Julius with his impetuous actionaccomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could havedone; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with hisplans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would havedone, he would never have succeeded.

Hence it is that for so long a time,and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever therehas been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account ofitself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria,Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)"|FALSE

For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and theSwitzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in closecombat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniardsare unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown bySpanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannotbe shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle ofRavenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions,who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agilityof body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of theGermans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stoodhelpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have beenover with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of boththese infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and notbe afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, buta variation upon the old.

1232|"These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini andtheir following, it appeared to them that the duke would become toopowerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seekto destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Uponthis a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia,to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrantof Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci,the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and courage of theduke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwisebring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they decided not toabandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; andthey send their men to one place and another, promising to one partyassistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against thecommon enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy,and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were thepeople of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution."|FALSE
1232|"Thus it arose that, men's minds being thus unsettled, it was decided bycertain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which washeld for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. Thecastellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were beingcarried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented frombeing drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leapingupon the bridge and thence into the fortress.

The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, againsteverybody's expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to theenemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recoveringcourage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporizebefore fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and tonegotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latterhe obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and byenlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort:to all he gave money."|FALSE
1232|"Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approachedFossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with theaid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them.

But the duke did not stop his preparations, and tookevery care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that suchpreparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops inseparate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile therecame also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he foundhimself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in openwar, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageousto outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work ofreconciliation."|FALSE
1232|"And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them inwhich he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousandducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formedan alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to comepersonally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On theother hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino andother places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, andnot to make war against or ally themselves with any one without hispermission."|FALSE
1232|"This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses inhis state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that thefortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held bythe enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersedhis men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of Novembertogether with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where hestayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini,who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to theenterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing beingconcluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the dukewished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; ifhe did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the dukereplied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thusbecome hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing toproceed against Sinigalia."|FALSE
1232|"It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but thefortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not giveit up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted himto come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, beinginvited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken nosuspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the Frenchmen-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundredlancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesenaabout the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmostcunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait forhim at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance wouldcast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation,and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils ofhis friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death ofhis brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwardstrust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke hadcorrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait."|FALSE
1232|"Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to beon 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his mosttrusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d'Euna,who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo,Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, hisfollowers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certainmen to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reachedSinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to theduke's quarters, where they should be seized."|FALSE
1232|"The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of whichthere were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, toassemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant fromFano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last dayof December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcadeof about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward theinfantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms."|FALSE
1232|"Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore ofthe Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he whogoes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the basesof which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia isdistant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shotand from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runsa little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano,facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes fora good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river whichpasses by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it,and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge whichcrosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads intoSinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gatethere stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank ofthe river forms one side."|FALSE
1232|"The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, andto honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distantfrom Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the menof the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fiftyhorsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Mattershaving been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, andwhen the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not passover, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river andthe other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle throughwhich the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town."|FALSE
1232|"Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by afew horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing acape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of hisapproaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of theman and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said thatwhen he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet theduke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommendedhis house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews thatit was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathersthat should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came beforethe duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him withgoodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissionedto look after them."|FALSE
1232|"But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band inSinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square beforehis quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drillingthem--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care ofOliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures thatOliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joinedOliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out oftheir quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to comehimself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, camebefore the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto,having made his obeisance, joined the others."|FALSE
1232|"So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke's quarters,and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made themprisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the menof Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those ofOliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsiniand Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of thedestruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, andbearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellianhouses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the countryand saved themselves."|FALSE
1232|"But the duke's soldiers, not being content with having pillaged themen of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke hadnot repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would havecompletely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them intoa room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words inkeeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask ofthe pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blamefor all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke diGravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that thepope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, andMesser Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, inthe castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way."|FALSE

1232|"It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those whohave considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others intheir day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity;or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They haveeither been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had somean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to besons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate whothese persons may have been because they are well known to everybody,and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who readthem, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of greatmen occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that suchmen owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to showher hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus allsuccess must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca wasone of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times inwhich he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others,he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the courseof this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall hismemory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour andfortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also thatI ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men Iknow delight most in noble deeds."|FALSE
1232|"The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble familiesof Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen inestate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a sonAntonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, andfor this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had anonly sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorsodying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to livewith her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house wherehe resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any personcould have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly aftersunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called,had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs forseasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leavesof a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard somethingresembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and sawthe hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves andwho seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partlyfearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it tothe house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as iscustomary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. Whenhe heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprisedor compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselveswhat should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had nochildren, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse forit, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. Theybaptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. Asthe years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence ofwit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years thoselessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intendedto make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into hiscanonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given withthis object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio wasquite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached theage of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of MesserAntonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he leftoff reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running,leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelledhis companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he didturn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mightydeeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow."|FALSE
1232|"There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He hadoften fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as aGhibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentlemanresided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others mostmornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at thetop of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he hadoften seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the streetin those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio farexcelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royalauthority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, MesserFrancesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informedof the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greaterdesire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day andasked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of agentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or inthe house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses andthe services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleasedCastruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even thoughhe stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by MesserFrancesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies andtake up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, andin a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who wasdriven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fearthat he would not be able to hold him much longer."|FALSE
1232|"Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priestto the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it wasastonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all thatvirtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a truegentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, andcould manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts andtournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But whatenhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightfulmodesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word toothers, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals,and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not onlyby all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reachedhis eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by theGuelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist theGhibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in thisexpedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, andhis name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout allLombardy."|FALSE
1232|"Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that heleft it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as manyfriends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessaryfor that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a sonthirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccioto be his son's tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he diedFrancesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo thatgoodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render tothe son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father.Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor ofPagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and createda certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the formeruniversal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannicalintentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, thehead of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of MesserFrancesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him thatCastruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, andholding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of hiseminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwardshe grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bringhim into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have himdriven out of Lucca."|FALSE
1232|"The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards becametheir lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effectingtheir restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought intohis plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of theOpizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiouslyfortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies andmunitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few daysin case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon withUguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains andPisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observedUguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to theportcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, callingthe people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccioneentered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgiowith all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governorwas driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes ofUguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that morethan one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those whofled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was theheadquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became mosthostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese."|FALSE
1232|"As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph partythat the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determinedto restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army inthe Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched toMontecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon thisUguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a numberof German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved againstthe quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemywithdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini andPescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and withinabout two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horseof both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness ofUguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with theenemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo tobe cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio.This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinkingthat the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grewover-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to passin order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, anddid not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the otherside, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidencesof fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in frontof the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy wassufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decidedto join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement tohis soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if theywould but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy hadplaced all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and hisless reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactlythe opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while thoseon whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observingthis order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sightof the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defyhim. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilsthe moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came intocontact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged,whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these twoportions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a longinterval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the morevaliant part of Castruccio's men were opposed to the weaker part of theenemy's troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged;and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who werearrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks.So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight onboth flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they foundthemselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displayingtheir valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy,there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers andknights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who hadcome to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto,and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part ofCastruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, amongwhom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, waskilled in the first onset."|FALSE
1232|"This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio thatUguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because itappeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase ofpower, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waitedfor an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death ofPier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, themurderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On thesergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were drivenoff by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming tothe knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him aproper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for hisson Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to takeCastruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertainedat supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him todeath lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order tohear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursedthe hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisato Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his ownway; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled andput his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca theirlord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences atPisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchesewith the example of Pisa before them should close their gates againsthim. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa,availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation ofCastruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city.They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openlyin the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms intheir hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should beset at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released himfrom prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, andwith the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had noresource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to thelords of Scale, where he died in poverty."|FALSE
1232|"But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the peoplethat they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Havingobtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned therecovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure ofUguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded atreaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed afort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course oftwo months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gainedat that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and ina short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close thepass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli andwrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was thelord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed bythe whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer todefer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Luccaby the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, FrancescoBoccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and hewas afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people.At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came intoItaly to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order thathe might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundredhorsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi,who was held in high estimation, because of the people's love forthe memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour byFrederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he wasappointed the emperor's lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisanswere in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven outof Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederickcreated Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of theGuelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained toaccept him as their lord."|FALSE
1232|"Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italianaffairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines,who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for helpand counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country,if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles wereMatteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and PieroBuonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had thesecret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid ofthese men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weightin affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, thePrince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and thecountry districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own countrydistricts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled themen under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into thefield twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon tohis assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forcesand allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked bythe Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with theassistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteocalled upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their ownterritories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelledto draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves.Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato,inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentinesrecalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castrucciowas forced by other necessities to return to Lucca."|FALSE
1232|"There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were sopowerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advancehim to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had notreceived such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incitedother families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They foundtheir opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon thelieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him.They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, apeaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened andcompelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offeredto be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him whatthey desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greaterintelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heardthe news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigiin command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet heposted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. Asit appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged tohim, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio topardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, theirformer friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under totheir house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefanoto reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to findthe tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of itsinception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, sayingthat he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing hisclemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio theysurrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison andput to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato,whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did notappear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him.He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which theyreadily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous ofgetting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them fortwo years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they hadmade. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attentionto affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject tothe perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretencesand reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition mightaspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving themof country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of lifealso, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were tobe trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Luccawith the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted outof the state."|FALSE
1232|"Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened hisposition in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, ofincreasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he couldget possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which washis great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends withthe mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both partiesconfided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always hadbeen, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi wasBastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these menheld secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drivethe other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came toblows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at thatof the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio thanin the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far moreready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent tohim for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that hewould come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, PagoloGuinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa,and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outsidethe city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leadersentered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia,and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killedthe partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoiapassed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria toleave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him,making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countrysideflocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hopeand quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his greatvalour."|FALSE
1232|"About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearnessof living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. TheGerman governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened--murders andtumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an endto them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should callin Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of thecity, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he couldapply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not onlyto give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccioconsidered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor thisservice, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at anytime the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in commandat Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, wherehe was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short timethe presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that,without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly byreason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisalarge quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble.When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others,voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received manyhonours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with thegreatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which hadthe following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\"Whilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\""|FALSE
1232|"During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccioshould have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they couldtempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficultin his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchiand Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. Thesemen kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with theaid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving outsome of Castruccio's officials and partisans, and killing others, theyrestored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angeredCastruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste toPistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he wouldlose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in theVal di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off hisroad to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelphcause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the otherhand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heardwhere the Florentines' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plainsof Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far ashe possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. Hebelieved that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured,although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men,whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidencein his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated toattack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers.Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hillwhich blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about abowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst ingeneral it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summitwhere the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it.The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castrucciobecame lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of thecastle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimedby either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as hekept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one.For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified,he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here thatCastruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few menwould have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the largemasses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should notstand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw theimmense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, andhaving an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managedmatters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admittedinto the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and thecastellan put to death."|FALSE
1232|"Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage theFlorentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war awayfrom Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move hisarmy from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reachedtheir encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on thefollowing morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle atnight, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thenceat midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus heand the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time inthe morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road,and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards thecastle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead oftheir army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio inpossession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized thecastle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hillwere completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry ofCastruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time topull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attackedby ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficultythey could hold their own, although some few of them got through. Whenthe noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it wasfilled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricablymixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward orforward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumultno one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short timethe cavalry who were engaged with the enemy's infantry were scatteredor killed without having made any effective defence because of theirunfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offereda stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains onboth flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear theirfriends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike adecisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousandinfantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundredhorsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the wholeforce to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried outwith such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,but gave way, and were soon in full retreat--conquered more by theirunfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in therear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, eachman seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and verysanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom wereBandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, allFlorentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on theFlorentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs.Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out thefriends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was notcontent with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on bothsides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing thespoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holdinghorse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medalsin commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured tocorrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the citygates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participatorsin it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci andLambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines greatanxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys toKing Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he,knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph causewas to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive fromthem a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send hisson Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen."|FALSE
1232|"Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of thepressure of Castruccio's army, owing to his being compelled to leavehis positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress aconspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherlandshould be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed thisconspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans ofCastruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracypaucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a feware not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracyLanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to BonifacioCerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were sufferingtheir banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and puthim to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove theirfamilies into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa andPistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energyupon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines theiropportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo,the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to loseno more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousandinfantry and ten thousand cavalry--having called to their aid everyGuelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attackPistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march onthe latter--a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely tosucceed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that thesurrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa."|FALSE
1232|"In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this armyand quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing fromthence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous armywhich the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degreealarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune woulddeliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason tothink that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospectsof success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousandfoot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went toFucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousandinfantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town inthe Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno andGusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover,the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they dividedtheir forces, nor could they approach it either from the directionof Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attackCastruccio's forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they wouldfind themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his owncommand and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they wouldhave to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, anundertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to takethis latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of theriver and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wideexpanse of land between them and the river."|FALSE
1232|"The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war todecide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon thelatter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yetthe water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to thesaddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentinescommenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and tenthousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, andwho well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with fivethousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them toissue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousandlight infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. Theinfantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and thewater that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilstthe cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for theothers, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed ofthe river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled overwith their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could notmove. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men weremeeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping tofind the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted forlanding. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castrucciohad already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers andjavelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the facesand bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and thewounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in greatconfusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of theenemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sidesfought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiersof Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst theFlorentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room forthe others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the waterwould be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urgedon by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were thesame enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst theFlorentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome bythe few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted,and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and thatboth sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body ofinfantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting;he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intendedto retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another tothe left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once tookadvantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield.But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters withCastruccio's reserves they could not stand against them and at once fellback into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gainedany decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing hisinferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on thedefensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped thatwhen he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short workof the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw theFlorentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainderof his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did withlance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon theenemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentinecaptains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with incrossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lowerdown the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio's army.But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men ofCastruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentineswere so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of themescaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains weretaken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with MichelagnoloFalconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled toEmpoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater,as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there felltwenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lostone thousand five hundred and seventy men."|FALSE
1232|"But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away hislife just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruinedall those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry intoeffect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but deathcould have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle thewhole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued andoverheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men ontheir return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on thewatch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be thefirst man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stoodexposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno,and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of whichhe thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it wasthe cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with highfever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must provefatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, andaddressed him as follows:"|FALSE
1232|"\"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in themidst of the career which was leading to that glory which all mysuccesses promised, I should have laboured less, and I should haveleft thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca andPisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged theFlorentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both thesepeoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least morepeacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but onemore secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, whoinsists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow mewith sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the timeto surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I havenever concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet aboy--a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul shouldfeel--and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had beenborn of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant andcapable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast beenwitness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all hispossessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, andincreased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And inorder that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy fatherleft, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I havenever married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mindfrom that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus Ileave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeplyconcerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hastthe city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented underthey government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of naturechangeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes heldin subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese.Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions anddeeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recentlyinflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines,injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, whowill hail the news of my death with more delight than they would theacquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milanthou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and theirhelp is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anythingbut in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in theprestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thouknowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to termswith the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this greatdefeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have soughtto make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them wouldconduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to makefriends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantagesand security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a manshould know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; andhe who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how togovern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rulethey conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what mylife-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeedwhen thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. Andthou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realmand have taught thee how to keep it.\""|FALSE
1232|"After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, andLucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagoloto them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, hedied. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and noprince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. Hisobsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buriedin San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigias she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not longafter the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, andonly with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in thefamily of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo."|FALSE
1232|"From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was aman of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his owntime, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was abovethe ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a graciouspresence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spokewith him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained orsnowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play falsewith the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom hedesired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victorythat brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one wasbolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. Hewas accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fearnothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees thatthe weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp orbiting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for anyindulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angeredwith others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he haslistened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on thefollowing occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge,and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio hadsaid: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\" \"That is true,\"answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much lessto me.\" Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show thathe scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to letthe waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a fewlittle fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I maycatch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patiencebut rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to liveso sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice than you shouldnot fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\" Passing through astreet he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush atbeing seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamedwhen thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\" A friendgave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, doyou think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble tofasten.\" Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"Youare like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the bestto eat,\" and was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to thehouses of those who have the greatest need of them.\" Going by water fromPisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm thatsprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him,who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that hedid not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is wasworth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, hesaid: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seatone piece of wood upon another.\" To a person who was boasting that hehad read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boastof remembering many things.\" Someone bragged that he could drink muchwithout becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: \"An ox does thesame.\" Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimaterelations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it wasundignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has nottaken me in, I have taken her.\" Being also blamed for eating very daintyfoods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\" and beingtold that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avariciousthan I am gluttonous.\" Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich andsplendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shownby Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stonesrepresenting flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring.Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out uponTaddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew notwhere to spit in order to offend thee less.\" Being asked how Caesardied he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\" Being one night in thehouse of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he wasreproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself withthem more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who isconsidered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\" A personcame to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listeningto his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharplyreproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus forthou hast thy ears in thy feet,\" whereupon he obtained double the favourhe had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easyone, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelledblindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluouswords, he said to him: \"When you have another request to make, sendsomeone else to make it.\" Having been wearied by a similar man with along oration who wound up by saying: \"Perhaps I have fatigued you byspeaking so long,\" Castruccio said: \"You have not, because I have notlistened to a word you said.\" He used to say of one who had been abeautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he wasdangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now hetook the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, hesaid: \"Do you laugh because you are successful or because another isunfortunate?\" Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer FrancescoGuinigi, one of his companions said to him: \"What shall I give you ifyou will let me give you a blow on the nose?\" Castruccio answered:\"A helmet.\" Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had beeninstrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had donewrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceivedthemselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatlythose men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, sayingthat they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refusedwhen the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise thatwhilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first tolearn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content withonly looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish tobe buried when he died, and answered: \"With the face turned downwards,for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\" Onbeing asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order tosave his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strangeto him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione dellaFaggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat topreserve his health, and replied: \"If the man be rich let him eatwhen he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\" Seeing on of hisgentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \"Ipray God that you will let him feed you also.\" Seeing that someone hadwritten upon his house in Latin the words: \"May God preserve this housefrom the wicked,\" he said, \"The owner must never go in.\" Passing throughone of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, andremarked: \"That house will fly through the door.\" He was having adiscussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning theproperty of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, andthe ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. \"Is this king ofyours a bad man or a good one?\" asked Castruccio, and was told that hewas a good one, whereupon he said, \"Why should you suggest that I shouldbe afraid of a good man?\""|FALSE
1232|"I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty andweighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony tohis high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way aprince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to beseen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they wereplaced by him to testify for ever to his days of adversity. As inhis life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father ofAlexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of hisage as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them hadFortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedoniaor Rome."|FALSE
