626|"The Author of the Book."|FALSE
626|"Richard de Bury (1281-1345), so called from being born near Bury St."|FALSE
626|"Edmunds, was the son of Sir Richard Aungerville. He studied at Oxford;"|FALSE
626|"and was subsequently chosen to be tutor to Prince Edward of Windsor,"|FALSE
626|"afterwards Edward III.  His loyalty to the cause of Queen Isabella and"|FALSE
626|"the Prince involved him in danger.  On the accession of his pupil he"|FALSE
626|"was made successively Cofferer, Treasurer of the Wardrobe, Archdeacon"|FALSE
626|"of Northampton, Prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, and Lichfield, Keeper of"|FALSE
626|"the Privy Purse, Ambassador on two occasions to Pope John XXII, who"|FALSE
626|"appointed him a chaplain of the papal chapel, Dean of Wells, and"|FALSE
626|"ultimately, at the end of the year 1333, Bishop of Durham; the King and"|FALSE
626|"Queen, the King of Scots, and all the magnates north of the Trent,"|FALSE
626|"together with a multitude of nobles and many others, were present at"|FALSE
626|"his enthronization.  It is noteworthy that during his stay at Avignon,"|FALSE
626|"probably in 1330, he made the acquaintance of Petrarch, who has left us"|FALSE
626|"a brief account of their intercourse.  In 1332 Richard visited"|FALSE
626|"Cambridge, as one of the King's commissioners, to inquire into the"|FALSE
626|"state of the King's Scholars there, and perhaps then became a member of"|FALSE
626|"the Gild of St. Mary--one of the two gilds which founded Corpus Christi"|FALSE
626|"College."|FALSE
626|"In 1334 he became High Chancellor of England, and Treasurer in 1336,"|FALSE
626|"resigning the former office in 1335, so that he might help the King in"|FALSE
626|"dealing with affairs abroad and in Scotland, and took a most"|FALSE
626|"distinguished part in diplomatic negociations between England and"|FALSE
626|"France.  In 1339 he was again in his bishopric.  Thereafter his name"|FALSE
626|"occurs often among those appointed to treat of peace with Philip of"|FALSE
626|"France, and with Bruce of Scotland.  It appears that he was not in"|FALSE
626|"Parliament in 1344.  Wasted by long sickness--longa infirmitate"|FALSE
626|"decoctus--on the 14th of April, 1345, Richard de Bury died at Auckland,"|FALSE
626|"and was buried in Durham Cathedral."|FALSE
626|"Dominus Ricardus de Bury migravit ad Dominum."|FALSE
626|"The Bishop as Booklover."|FALSE
626|"According to the concluding note, the Philobiblon was completed on the"|FALSE
626|"bishop's fifty-eighth birthday, the 24th of January, 1345, so that even"|FALSE
626|"though weakened by illness, Richard must have been actively engaged in"|FALSE
626|"his literary efforts to the very end of his generous and noble life."|FALSE
626|"His enthusiastic devoted biographer Chambre[1] gives a vivid account of"|FALSE
626|"the bishop's bookloving propensities, supplementary to what can be"|FALSE
626|"gathered from the Philobiblon itself.  Iste summe delectabatur in"|FALSE
626|"multitudine librorum; he had more books, as was commonly reported, than"|FALSE
626|"all the other English bishops put together.  He had a separate library"|FALSE
626|"in each of his residences, and wherever he was residing, so many books"|FALSE
626|"lay about his bed-chamber, that it was hardly possible to stand or move"|FALSE
626|"without treading upon them.  All the time he could spare from business"|FALSE
626|"was devoted either to religious offices or to his books.  Every day"|FALSE
626|"while at table he would have a book read to him, unless some special"|FALSE
626|"guest were present, and afterwards would engage in discussion on the"|FALSE
626|"subject of the reading.  The haughty Anthony Bec delighted in the"|FALSE
626|"appendages of royalty--to be addressed by nobles kneeling, and to be"|FALSE
626|"waited on in his presence-chamber and at his table by Knights"|FALSE
626|"bare-headed and standing; but De Bury loved to surround himself with"|FALSE
626|"learned scholars.  Among these were such men as Thomas Bradwardine,"|FALSE
626|"afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, and author of the De Causa Dei;"|FALSE
626|"Richard Fitzralph, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh, and famous for his"|FALSE
626|"hostility to the mendicant orders; Walter Burley, who dedicated to him"|FALSE
626|"a translation of the Politics of Aristotle made at his suggestion; John"|FALSE
626|"Mauduit, the astronomer; Robert Holkot, author of many books; Richard"|FALSE
626|"de Kilvington; Richard Benworth, afterwards Bishop of London; and"|FALSE
626|"Walter Seagrave, who became Dean of Chichester.\"[2]"|FALSE
626|"[1] Cp. Surtees Society's edition of Scriptores Tres; also Wharton's"|FALSE
626|"Anglia Sacra."|FALSE
626|"[2] An unsuccessful attempt has been made to transfer the authorship of"|FALSE
626|"the book to Robert Holkot.  Various theories have been advanced against"|FALSE
626|"Richard's claims.  It is noteworthy that his contemporary Adam Murimuth"|FALSE
626|"disparages him as \"mediocriter literatus, volens tamen magnus clericus"|FALSE
626|"reputari,\" but such disparagement must be taken with the utmost"|FALSE
626|"caution. The really difficult fact to be accounted for is the omission"|FALSE
626|"on the part of Chambre to mention the book."|FALSE
626|"The Bishop's Books."|FALSE
626|"In the Philobiblon, Richard de Bury frankly and clearly describes his"|FALSE
626|"means and method of collecting books.  Anyhow his object was clearly"|FALSE
626|"not selfish.  The treatise contains his rules for the library of the"|FALSE
626|"new College at Oxford--Durham College (where Trinity College now"|FALSE
626|"stands)--which he practically founded, though his successor, Bishop"|FALSE
626|"Hatfield, carried the scheme into effect.  It is traditionally reported"|FALSE
626|"that Richard's books were sent, in his lifetime or after his death, to"|FALSE
626|"the house of the Durham Benedictines at Oxford, and there remained"|FALSE
626|"until the dissolution of the College by Henry VIII., when they were"|FALSE
626|"dispersed, some going into Duke Humphrey's (the University) library,"|FALSE
626|"others to Balliol College, and the remainder passing into the hands of"|FALSE
626|"Dr. George Owen, who purchased the site of the dissolved College.[3]"|FALSE
626|"[3] Mr. J. W. Clark puts the matter as follows:--\"Durham College,"|FALSE
626|"maintained by the Benedictines of Durham, was supplied with books from"|FALSE
626|"the mother-house, lists of which have been preserved; and subsequently"|FALSE
626|"a library was built there to contain the collection bequeathed in 1345"|FALSE
626|"by Richard de Bury\" (The Care of Books, p.  142).  Mr. Thomas points"|FALSE
626|"out that De Bury's executors sold at least some portion of his books;"|FALSE
626|"and, moreover, his biographer says nothing of a library at Oxford."|FALSE
626|"Possibly the scheme was never carried out.  In the British Museum (Roy."|FALSE
626|"13 D. iv. 3) is a large folio MS. of the works of John of Salisbury,"|FALSE
626|"which was one of the books bought back from the Bishop's executors."|FALSE
626|"Unfortunately, the \"special catalogue\" of his books prepared by Richard"|FALSE
626|"has not come down to us; but \"from his own book and from the books"|FALSE
626|"cited in the works of his friends and housemates, who may reasonably be"|FALSE
626|"supposed to have drawn largely from the bishop's collection, it would"|FALSE
626|"be possible to restore a hypothetical but not improbable Bibliotheca"|FALSE
626|"Ricardi de Bury.  The difficulty would be with that contemporary"|FALSE
626|"literature, which they would think below the dignity of quotation, but"|FALSE
626|"which we know the Bishop collected.\""|FALSE
626|"Early Editions of the Philobiblon."|FALSE
626|"The book was first printed at Cologne in 1473, at Spires in 1483, and"|FALSE
626|"at Paris in 1500.  The first English edition appeared in 1598-9, edited"|FALSE
626|"by Thomas James, Bodley's first librarian.  Other editions appeared in"|FALSE
626|"Germany in 1610, 1614, 1674 and 1703; at Paris in 1856; at Albany in"|FALSE
626|"1861.  The texts were, with the exception of those issued in 1483 and"|FALSE
626|"1599, based on the 1473 edition; though the French edition and"|FALSE
626|"translation of 1856, prepared by M. Cocheris, claimed to be a critical"|FALSE
626|"version, it left the text untouched, and merely gave the various"|FALSE
626|"readings of the three Paris manuscripts at the foot of the pages; these"|FALSE
626|"readings are moreover badly chosen, and the faults of the version are"|FALSE
626|"further to be referred to the use of the ill-printed 1703 edition as"|FALSE
626|"copy."|FALSE
626|"In 1832 there appeared an anonymous English translation, now known to"|FALSE
626|"have been by J. B. Inglis; it followed the edition of 1473, with all"|FALSE
626|"its errors and inaccuracies."|FALSE
626|"Mr. E. C. Thomas' Text.--The first true text of the Philobiblon, the"|FALSE
626|"result of a careful examination of twenty-eight MSS., and of the"|FALSE

626|"Librarian of the Oxford Union.  London: Kegan Paul, Trench, & Co.\""|FALSE
626|"For fifteen years the enthusiastic editor--an ideal Bibliophile--had"|FALSE
626|"toiled at his labour of love, and his work was on all sides received"|FALSE
626|"with the recognition due to his monumental achievement.  To the great"|FALSE
626|"loss of English learning, he did not long survive the conclusion of his"|FALSE
626|"labours.  The very limited edition of the work was soon exhausted, and"|FALSE
626|"it is by the most generous permission of his father, Mr. John Thomas,"|FALSE
626|"of Lower Broughton, Manchester, that the translation--the only"|FALSE
626|"trustworthy rendering of Richard de Bury's precious treatise--is now,"|FALSE
626|"for the first time, made accessible to the larger book-loving public,"|FALSE
626|"and fittingly inaugurates the present series of English classics.  The"|FALSE
626|"general Editor desires to express his best thanks to Mr. John Thomas,"|FALSE
626|"as also to Messrs. Kegan Paul, for their kindness in allowing him to"|FALSE
626|"avail himself of the materials included in the 1888 edition of the"|FALSE
626|"work.  He has attempted, in the brief Preface and Notes, to condense"|FALSE
626|"Mr. Thomas' labours in such a way as would have been acceptable to the"|FALSE
626|"lamented scholar, and though he has made bold to explain some few"|FALSE
626|"textual difficulties, and to add some few references, he would fain"|FALSE
626|"hope that these additions have been made with modest caution--with the"|FALSE
626|"reverence due to the unstinted toil of a Bibliophile after Richard de"|FALSE
626|"Bury's own pattern.  Yet once again Richard de Bury's Philobiblon,"|FALSE

626|"everlasting salvation in the Lord and to present continually a pious"|FALSE
626|"memorial of himself before God, alike in his lifetime and after his"|FALSE
626|"death."|FALSE
626|"What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits towards me? asks"|FALSE
626|"the most devout Psalmist, an invincible King and first among the"|FALSE
626|"prophets; in which most grateful question he approves himself a willing"|FALSE
626|"thank-offerer, a multifarious debtor, and one who wishes for a holier"|FALSE
626|"counsellor than himself: agreeing with Aristotle, the chief of"|FALSE
626|"philosophers, who shows (in the 3rd and 6th books of his Ethics) that"|FALSE
626|"all action depends upon counsel."|FALSE
626|"And indeed if so wonderful a prophet, having a fore-knowledge of divine"|FALSE
626|"secrets, wished so anxiously to consider how he might gratefully repay"|FALSE
626|"the blessings graciously bestowed, what can we fitly do, who are but"|FALSE
626|"rude thanksgivers and most greedy receivers, laden with infinite divine"|FALSE
626|"benefits?  Assuredly we ought with anxious deliberation and abundant"|FALSE
626|"consideration, having first invoked the Sevenfold Spirit, that it may"|FALSE
626|"burn in our musings as an illuminating fire, fervently to prepare a way"|FALSE
626|"without hinderance, that the bestower of all things may be cheerfully"|FALSE
626|"worshipped in return for the gifts that He has bestowed, that our"|FALSE
626|"neighbour may be relieved of his burden, and that the guilt contracted"|FALSE
626|"by sinners every day may be redeemed by the atonement of almsgiving."|FALSE
626|"Forewarned therefore through the admonition of the Psalmist's devotion"|FALSE
626|"by Him who alone prevents and perfects the goodwill of man, without"|FALSE
626|"Whom we have no power even so much as to think, and Whose gift we doubt"|FALSE
626|"not it is, if we have done anything good, we have diligently inquired"|FALSE
626|"and considered in our own heart as well as with others, what among the"|FALSE
626|"good offices of various works of piety would most please the Almighty,"|FALSE
626|"and would be more beneficial to the Church Militant.  And lo! there"|FALSE
626|"soon occurred to our contemplation a host of unhappy, nay, rather of"|FALSE
626|"elect scholars, in whom God the Creator and Nature His handmaid planted"|FALSE
626|"the roots of excellent morals and of famous sciences, but whom the"|FALSE
626|"poverty of their circumstances so oppressed that before the frown of"|FALSE
626|"adverse fortune the seeds of excellence, so fruitful in the cultivated"|FALSE
626|"field of youth, not being watered by the rain that they require, are"|FALSE
626|"forced to wither away. Thus it happens that \"bright virtue lurks buried"|FALSE
626|"in obscurity,\" to use the words of Boethius, and burning lights are not"|FALSE
626|"put under a bushel, but for want of oil are utterly extinguished.  Thus"|FALSE
626|"the field, so full of flower in Spring, has withered up before harvest"|FALSE
626|"time; thus wheat degenerates to tares, and vines into the wild vines,"|FALSE
626|"and thus olives run into the wild olive; the tender stems rot away"|FALSE
626|"altogether, and those who might have grown up into strong pillars of"|FALSE
626|"the Church, being endowed with the capacity of a subtle intellect,"|FALSE
626|"abandon the schools of learning.  With poverty only as their"|FALSE
626|"stepmother, they are repelled violently from the nectared cup of"|FALSE
626|"philosophy as soon as they have tasted of it and have become more"|FALSE
626|"fiercely thirsty by the very taste.  Though fit for the liberal arts"|FALSE
626|"and disposed to study the sacred writings alone, being deprived of the"|FALSE
626|"aid of their friends, by a kind of apostasy they return to the"|FALSE
626|"mechanical arts solely to gain a livelihood, to the loss of the Church"|FALSE
626|"and the degradation of the whole clergy.  Thus Mother Church conceiving"|FALSE
626|"sons is compelled to miscarry, nay, some misshapen monster is born"|FALSE
626|"untimely from her womb, and for lack of that little with which Nature"|FALSE
626|"is contented, she loses excellent pupils, who might afterwards become"|FALSE
626|"champions and athletes of the faith.  Alas, how suddenly the woof is"|FALSE
626|"cut, while the hand of the weaver is beginning his work! Alas, how the"|FALSE
626|"sun is eclipsed in the brightness of the dawn, and the planet in its"|FALSE
626|"course is hurled backwards, and, while it bears the nature and likeness"|FALSE
626|"of a star suddenly drops and becomes a meteor! What more piteous sight"|FALSE
626|"can the pious man behold? What can more sharply stir the bowels of his"|FALSE
626|"pity? What can more easily melt a heart hard as an anvil into hot"|FALSE
626|"tears? On the other hand, let us recall from past experience how much"|FALSE
626|"it has profited the whole Christian commonwealth, not indeed to"|FALSE
626|"enervate students with the delights of a Sardanapalus or the riches of"|FALSE
626|"a Croesus, but rather to support them in their poverty with the frugal"|FALSE
626|"means that become the scholar.  How many have we seen with our eyes,"|FALSE
626|"how many have we read of in books, who, distinguished by no pride of"|FALSE
626|"birth, and rejoicing in no rich inheritance, but supported only by the"|FALSE
626|"piety of the good, have made their way to apostolic chairs, have most"|FALSE
626|"worthily presided over faithful subjects, have bent the necks of the"|FALSE
626|"proud and lofty to the ecclesiastical yoke and have extended further"|FALSE
626|"the liberties of the Church!"|FALSE
626|"Accordingly, having taken a survey of human necessities in every"|FALSE
626|"direction, with a view to bestow our charity upon them, our"|FALSE
626|"compassionate inclinations have chosen to bear pious aid to this"|FALSE
626|"calamitous class of men, in whom there is nevertheless such hope of"|FALSE
626|"advantage to the Church, and to provide for them, not only in respect"|FALSE
626|"of things necessary to their support, but much more in respect of the"|FALSE
626|"books so useful to their studies.  To this end, most acceptable in the"|FALSE
626|"sight of God, our attention has long been unweariedly devoted.  This"|FALSE
626|"ecstatic love has carried us away so powerfully, that we have resigned"|FALSE
626|"all thoughts of other earthly things, and have given ourselves up to a"|FALSE
626|"passion for acquiring books.  That our intent and purpose, therefore,"|FALSE
626|"may be known to posterity as well as to our contemporaries, and that we"|FALSE
626|"may for ever stop the perverse tongues of gossipers as far as we are"|FALSE
626|"concerned, we have published a little treatise written in the lightest"|FALSE
626|"style of the moderns; for it is ridiculous to find a slight matter"|FALSE
626|"treated of in a pompous style.  And this treatise (divided into twenty"|FALSE
626|"chapters) will clear the love we have had for books from the charge of"|FALSE
626|"excess, will expound the purpose of our intense devotion, and will"|FALSE
626|"narrate more clearly than light all the circumstances of our"|FALSE
626|"undertaking.  And because it principally treats of the love of books,"|FALSE
626|"we have chosen, after the fashion of the ancient Romans, fondly to name"|FALSE
626|"it by a Greek word, Philobiblon."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER I"|FALSE
626|"THAT THE TREASURE OF WISDOM IS CHIEFLY CONTAINED IN BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"The desirable treasure of wisdom and science, which all men desire by"|FALSE
626|"an instinct of nature, infinitely surpasses all the riches of the"|FALSE
626|"world; in respect of which precious stones are worthless; in comparison"|FALSE
626|"with which silver is as clay and pure gold is as a little sand; at"|FALSE
626|"whose splendour the sun and moon are dark to look upon; compared with"|FALSE
626|"whose marvellous sweetness honey and manna are bitter to the taste.  O"|FALSE
626|"value of wisdom that fadeth not away with time, virtue ever"|FALSE
626|"flourishing, that cleanseth its possessor from all venom!  O heavenly"|FALSE
626|"gift of the divine bounty, descending from the Father of lights, that"|FALSE
626|"thou mayest exalt the rational soul to the very heavens!  Thou art the"|FALSE
626|"celestial nourishment of the intellect, which those who eat shall still"|FALSE
626|"hunger and those who drink shall still thirst, and the gladdening"|FALSE
626|"harmony of the languishing soul which he that hears shall never be"|FALSE
626|"confounded.  Thou art the moderator and rule of morals, which he who"|FALSE
626|"follows shall not sin.  By thee kings reign and princes decree justice."|FALSE
626|"By thee, rid of their native rudeness, their minds and tongues being"|FALSE
626|"polished, the thorns of vice being torn up by the roots, those men"|FALSE
626|"attain high places of honour, and become fathers of their country, and"|FALSE
626|"companions of princes, who without thee would have melted their spears"|FALSE
626|"into pruning-hooks and ploughshares, or would perhaps be feeding swine"|FALSE
626|"with the prodigal."|FALSE
626|"Where dost thou chiefly lie hidden, O most elect treasure! and where"|FALSE
626|"shall thirsting souls discover thee?"|FALSE
626|"Certes, thou hast placed thy tabernacle in books, where the Most High,"|FALSE
626|"the Light of lights, the Book of Life, has established thee.  There"|FALSE
626|"everyone who asks receiveth thee, and everyone who seeks finds thee,"|FALSE
626|"and to everyone that knocketh boldly it is speedily opened.  Therein"|FALSE
626|"the cherubim spread out their wings, that the intellect of the students"|FALSE
626|"may ascend and look from pole to pole, from the east and west, from the"|FALSE
626|"north and from the south.  Therein the mighty and incomprehensible God"|FALSE
626|"Himself is apprehensibly contained and worshipped; therein is revealed"|FALSE
626|"the nature of things celestial, terrestrial, and infernal; therein are"|FALSE
626|"discerned the laws by which every state is administered, the offices of"|FALSE
626|"the celestial hierarchy are distinguished, and the tyrannies of demons"|FALSE
626|"described, such as neither the ideas of Plato transcend, nor the chair"|FALSE
626|"of Crato contained."|FALSE
626|"In books I find the dead as if they were alive; in books I foresee"|FALSE
626|"things to come; in books warlike affairs are set forth; from books come"|FALSE
626|"forth the laws of peace.  All things are corrupted and decay in time;"|FALSE
626|"Saturn ceases not to devour the children that he generates; all the"|FALSE
626|"glory of the world would be buried in oblivion, unless God had provided"|FALSE
626|"mortals with the remedy of books."|FALSE

626|"of the world, who, the first in war and arts, assumed universal empire"|FALSE
626|"under his single rule, faithful Fabricius and stern Cato, would now"|FALSE
626|"have been unknown to fame, if the aid of books had been wanting."|FALSE
626|"Towers have been razed to the ground; cities have been overthrown;"|FALSE
626|"triumphal arches have perished from decay; nor can either pope or king"|FALSE
626|"find any means of more easily conferring the privilege of perpetuity"|FALSE
626|"than by books.  The book that he has made renders its author this"|FALSE
626|"service in return, that so long as the book survives its author remains"|FALSE
626|"immortal and cannot die, as Ptolemy declares in the Prologue to his"|FALSE
626|"Almagest: He is not dead, he says, who has given life to science."|FALSE
626|"Who therefore will limit by anything of another kind the price of the"|FALSE
626|"infinite treasure of books, from which the scribe who is instructed"|FALSE
626|"bringeth forth things new and old?  Truth that triumphs over all"|FALSE

626|"holy to honour before friendship, which is the way without turning and"|FALSE
626|"the life without end, which holy Boethius considers to be threefold in"|FALSE
626|"thought, speech, and writing, seems to remain more usefully and to"|FALSE
626|"fructify to greater profit in books.  For the meaning of the voice"|FALSE
626|"perishes with the sound; truth latent in the mind is wisdom that is hid"|FALSE
626|"and treasure that is not seen; but truth which shines forth in books"|FALSE
626|"desires to manifest itself to every impressionable sense.  It commends"|FALSE
626|"itself to the sight when it is read, to the hearing when it is heard,"|FALSE
626|"and moreover in a manner to the touch, when it suffers itself to be"|FALSE
626|"transcribed, bound, corrected, and preserved.   The undisclosed truth"|FALSE
626|"of the mind, although it is the possession of the noble soul, yet"|FALSE
626|"because it lacks a companion, is not certainly known to be delightful,"|FALSE
626|"while neither sight nor hearing takes account of it.  Further the truth"|FALSE
626|"of the voice is patent only to the ear and eludes the sight, which"|FALSE
626|"reveals to us more of the qualities of things, and linked with the"|FALSE
626|"subtlest of motions begins and perishes as it were in a breath.  But"|FALSE
626|"the written truth of books, not transient but permanent, plainly offers"|FALSE
626|"itself to be observed, and by means of the pervious spherules of the"|FALSE
626|"eyes, passing through the vestibule of perception and the courts of"|FALSE
626|"imagination, enters the chamber of intellect, taking its place in the"|FALSE
626|"couch of memory, where it engenders the eternal truth of the mind."|FALSE
626|"Finally we must consider what pleasantness of teaching there is in"|FALSE
626|"books, how easy, how secret! How safely we lay bare the poverty of"|FALSE
626|"human ignorance to books without feeling any shame!  They are masters"|FALSE
626|"who instruct us without rod or ferule, without angry words, without"|FALSE
626|"clothes or money.  If you come to them they are not asleep; if you ask"|FALSE
626|"and inquire of them they do not withdraw themselves; they do not chide"|FALSE
626|"if you make mistakes; they do not laugh at you if you are ignorant.  O"|FALSE
626|"books, who alone are liberal and free, who give to all who ask of you"|FALSE
626|"and enfranchise all who serve you faithfully!  By how many thousand"|FALSE
626|"types are ye commended to learned men in the Scriptures given us by"|FALSE
626|"inspiration of God!  For ye are the minds of profoundest wisdom, to"|FALSE
626|"which the wise man sends his son that he may dig out treasures: Prov."|FALSE
626|"ii.  Ye are the wells of living waters, which father Abraham first"|FALSE
626|"digged, Isaac digged again, and which the Philistines strive to fill"|FALSE
626|"up: Gen. xxvi.  Ye are indeed the most delightful ears of corn, full of"|FALSE
626|"grain, to be rubbed only by apostolic hands, that the sweetest food may"|FALSE
626|"be produced for hungry souls: Matt. xii.  Ye are the golden pots in"|FALSE
626|"which manna is stored, and rocks flowing with honey, nay, combs of"|FALSE
626|"honey, most plenteous udders of the milk of life, garners ever full; ye"|FALSE
626|"are the tree of life and the fourfold river of Paradise, by which the"|FALSE
626|"human mind is nourished, and the thirsty intellect is watered and"|FALSE
626|"refreshed.  Ye are the ark of Noah and the ladder of Jacob, and the"|FALSE
626|"troughs by which the young of those who look therein are coloured; ye"|FALSE
626|"are the stones of testimony and the pitchers holding the lamps of"|FALSE
626|"Gideon, the scrip of David, from which the smoothest stones are taken"|FALSE
626|"for the slaying of Goliath.  Ye are the golden vessels of the temple,"|FALSE
626|"the arms of the soldiers of the Church with which to quench all the"|FALSE
626|"fiery darts of the wicked, fruitful olives, vines of Engadi, fig-trees"|FALSE
626|"that are never barren, burning lamps always to be held in"|FALSE
626|"readiness--and all the noblest comparisons of Scripture may be applied"|FALSE
626|"to books, if we choose to speak in figures."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER II"|FALSE
626|"THE DEGREE OF AFFECTION THAT IS PROPERLY DUE TO BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"Since the degree of affection a thing deserves depends upon the degree"|FALSE
626|"of its value, and the previous chapter shows that the value of books is"|FALSE
626|"unspeakable, it is quite clear to the reader what is the probable"|FALSE
626|"conclusion from this.  I say probable, for in moral science we do not"|FALSE
626|"insist upon demonstration, remembering that the educated man seeks such"|FALSE
626|"degree of certainty as he perceives the subject-matter will bear, as"|FALSE
626|"Aristotle testifies in the first book of his Ethics.  For Tully does"|FALSE
626|"not appeal to Euclid, nor does Euclid rely upon Tully.  This at all"|FALSE
626|"events we endeavour to prove, whether by logic or rhetoric, that all"|FALSE
626|"riches and all delights whatsoever yield place to books in the"|FALSE
626|"spiritual mind, wherein the Spirit which is charity ordereth charity."|FALSE
626|"Now in the first place, because wisdom is contained in books more than"|FALSE
626|"all mortals understand, and wisdom thinks lightly of riches, as the"|FALSE
626|"foregoing chapter declares.  Furthermore, Aristotle, in his Problems,"|FALSE
626|"determines the question, why the ancients proposed prizes to the"|FALSE
626|"stronger in gymnastic and corporeal contests, but never awarded any"|FALSE
626|"prize for wisdom.  This question he solves as follows:  In gymnastic"|FALSE
626|"exercises the prize is better and more desirable than that for which it"|FALSE
626|"is bestowed; but it is certain that nothing is better than wisdom:"|FALSE
626|"wherefore no prize could be assigned for wisdom.  And therefore neither"|FALSE
626|"riches nor delights are more excellent than wisdom.  Again, only the"|FALSE
626|"fool will deny that friendship is to be preferred to riches, since the"|FALSE
626|"wisest of men testifies this; but the chief of philosophers honours"|FALSE
626|"truth before friendship, and the truthful Zorobabel prefers it to all"|FALSE
626|"things.  Riches, then, are less than truth.  Now truth is chiefly"|FALSE
626|"maintained and contained in holy books--nay, they are written truth"|FALSE
626|"itself, since by books we do not now mean the materials of which they"|FALSE
626|"are made.  Wherefore riches are less than books, especially as the most"|FALSE
626|"precious of all riches are friends, as Boethius testifies in the second"|FALSE
626|"book of his Consolation; to whom the truth of books according to"|FALSE
626|"Aristotle is to be preferred.  Moreover, since we know that riches"|FALSE
626|"first and chiefly appertain to the support of the body only, while the"|FALSE
626|"virtue of books is the perfection of reason, which is properly speaking"|FALSE
626|"the happiness of man, it appears that books to the man who uses his"|FALSE
626|"reason are dearer than riches.  Furthermore, that by which the faith is"|FALSE
626|"more easily defended, more widely spread, more clearly preached, ought"|FALSE
626|"to be more desirable to the faithful.  But this is the truth written in"|FALSE
626|"books, which our Saviour plainly showed, when he was about to contend"|FALSE
626|"stoutly against the Tempter, girding himself with the shield of truth"|FALSE
626|"and indeed of written truth, declaring \"it is written\" of what he was"|FALSE
626|"about to utter with his voice."|FALSE
626|"And, again, no one doubts that happiness is to be preferred to riches."|FALSE
626|"But happiness consists in the operation of the noblest and diviner of"|FALSE
626|"the faculties that we possess--when the whole mind is occupied in"|FALSE
626|"contemplating the truth of wisdom, which is the most delectable of all"|FALSE
626|"our virtuous activities, as the prince of philosophers declares in the"|FALSE
626|"tenth book of the Ethics, on which account it is that philosophy is"|FALSE
626|"held to have wondrous pleasures in respect of purity and solidity, as"|FALSE
626|"he goes on to say.  But the contemplation of truth is never more"|FALSE
626|"perfect than in books, where the act of imagination perpetuated by"|FALSE
626|"books does not suffer the operation of the intellect upon the truths"|FALSE
626|"that it has seen to suffer interruption.  Wherefore books appear to be"|FALSE
626|"the most immediate instruments of speculative delight, and therefore"|FALSE
626|"Aristotle, the sun of philosophic truth, in considering the principles"|FALSE
626|"of choice, teaches that in itself to philosophize is more desirable"|FALSE
626|"than to be rich, although in certain cases, as where for instance one"|FALSE
626|"is in need of necessaries, it may be more desirable to be rich than to"|FALSE
626|"philosophize."|FALSE
626|"Moreover, since books are the aptest teachers, as the previous chapter"|FALSE
626|"assumes, it is fitting to bestow on them the honour and the affection"|FALSE
626|"that we owe to our teachers.  In fine, since all men naturally desire"|FALSE
626|"to know, and since by means of books we can attain the knowledge of the"|FALSE
626|"ancients, which is to be desired beyond all riches, what man living"|FALSE
626|"according to nature would not feel the desire of books?  And although"|FALSE
626|"we know that swine trample pearls under foot, the wise man will not"|FALSE
626|"therefore be deterred from gathering the pearls that lie before him.  A"|FALSE
626|"library of wisdom, then, is more precious than all wealth, and all"|FALSE
626|"things that are desirable cannot be compared to it.  Whoever therefore"|FALSE
626|"claims to be zealous of truth, of happiness, of wisdom or knowledge,"|FALSE
626|"aye, even of the faith, must needs become a lover of books."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER III"|FALSE
626|"WHAT WE ARE TO THINK OF THE PRICE IN THE BUYING OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"From what has been said we draw this corollary welcome to us, but (as"|FALSE
626|"we believe) acceptable to few: namely, that no dearness of price ought"|FALSE
626|"to hinder a man from the buying of books, if he has the money that is"|FALSE
626|"demanded for them, unless it be to withstand the malice of the seller"|FALSE
626|"or to await a more favourable opportunity of buying.  For if it is"|FALSE
626|"wisdom only that makes the price of books, which is an infinite"|FALSE
626|"treasure to mankind, and if the value of books is unspeakable, as the"|FALSE
626|"premises show, how shall the bargain be shown to be dear where an"|FALSE
626|"infinite good is being bought? Wherefore, that books are to be gladly"|FALSE
626|"bought and unwillingly sold, Solomon, the sun of men, exhorts us in the"|FALSE
626|"Proverbs: Buy the truth, he says, and sell not wisdom.  But what we are"|FALSE
626|"trying to show by rhetoric or logic, let us prove by examples from"|FALSE
626|"history.  The arch-philosopher Aristotle, whom Averroes regards as the"|FALSE
626|"law of Nature, bought a few books of Speusippus straightway after his"|FALSE
626|"death for 72,000 sesterces.  Plato, before him in time, but after him"|FALSE
626|"in learning, bought the book of Philolaus the Pythagorean, from which"|FALSE
626|"he is said to have taken the Timaeus, for 10,000 denaries, as Aulus"|FALSE
626|"Gellius relates in the Noctes Atticae. Now Aulus Gellius relates this"|FALSE
626|"that the foolish may consider how wise men despise money in comparison"|FALSE
626|"with books.  And on the other hand, that we may know that folly and"|FALSE
626|"pride go together, let us here relate the folly of Tarquin the Proud in"|FALSE
626|"despising books, as also related by Aulus Gellius.  An old woman,"|FALSE
626|"utterly unknown, is said to have come to Tarquin the Proud, the seventh"|FALSE
626|"king of Rome, offering to sell nine books, in which (as she declared)"|FALSE
626|"sacred oracles were contained, but she asked an immense sum for them,"|FALSE
626|"insomuch that the king said she was mad.  In anger she flung three"|FALSE
626|"books into the fire, and still asked the same sum for the rest.  When"|FALSE
626|"the king refused it, again she flung three others into the fire and"|FALSE
626|"still asked the same price for the three that were left.  At last,"|FALSE
626|"astonished beyond measure, Tarquin was glad to pay for three books the"|FALSE
626|"same price for which he might have bought nine.  The old woman"|FALSE
626|"straightway disappeared, and was never seen before or after.  These"|FALSE
626|"were the Sibylline books, which the Romans consulted as a divine oracle"|FALSE
626|"by some one of the Quindecemvirs, and this is believed to have been the"|FALSE
626|"origin of the Quindecemvirate.  What did this Sibyl teach the proud"|FALSE
626|"king by this bold deed, except that the vessels of wisdom, holy books,"|FALSE
626|"exceed all human estimation; and, as Gregory says of the kingdom of"|FALSE
626|"Heaven:  They are worth all that thou hast?"|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER IV"|FALSE
626|"THE COMPLAINT OF BOOKS AGAINST THE CLERGY ALREADY PROMOTED"|FALSE
626|"A generation of vipers destroying their own parent and base offspring"|FALSE
626|"of the ungrateful cuckoo, who when he has grown strong slays his nurse,"|FALSE
626|"the giver of his strength, are degenerate clerks with regard to books."|FALSE
626|"Bring it again to mind and consider faithfully what ye receive through"|FALSE
626|"books, and ye will find that books are as it were the creators of your"|FALSE
626|"distinction, without which other favourers would have been wanting."|FALSE
626|"In sooth, while still untrained and helpless ye crept up to us, ye"|FALSE
626|"spake as children, ye thought as children, ye cried as children and"|FALSE
626|"begged to be made partakers of our milk.  But we being straightway"|FALSE
626|"moved by your tears gave you the breast of grammar to suck, which ye"|FALSE
626|"plied continually with teeth and tongue, until ye lost your native"|FALSE
626|"barbarousness and learned to speak with our tongues the mighty things"|FALSE
626|"of God.  And next we clad you with the goodly garments of philosophy,"|FALSE
626|"rhetoric and dialectic, of which we had and have a store, while ye were"|FALSE
626|"naked as a tablet to be painted on.  For all the household of"|FALSE
626|"philosophy are clothed with garments, that the nakedness and rawness of"|FALSE
626|"the intellect may be covered. After this, providing you with the"|FALSE
626|"fourfold wings of the quadrivials that ye might be winged like the"|FALSE
626|"seraphs and so mount above the cherubim, we sent you to a friend at"|FALSE
626|"whose door, if only ye importunately knocked, ye might borrow the three"|FALSE
626|"loaves of the Knowledge of the Trinity, in which consists the final"|FALSE
626|"felicity of every sojourner below.  Nay, if ye deny that ye had these"|FALSE
626|"privileges, we boldly declare that ye either lost them by your"|FALSE
626|"carelessness, or that through your sloth ye spurned them when offered"|FALSE
626|"to you. If these things seem but a light matter to you, we will add yet"|FALSE
626|"greater things.  Ye are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy"|FALSE
626|"race, ye are a peculiar people chosen into the lot of God, ye are"|FALSE
626|"priests and ministers of God, nay, ye are called the very Church of"|FALSE
626|"God, as though the laity were not to be called churchmen.  Ye, being"|FALSE
626|"preferred to the laity, sing psalms and hymns in the chancel, and,"|FALSE
626|"serving the altar and living by the altar, make the true body of"|FALSE
626|"Christ, wherein God Himself has honoured you not only above the laity,"|FALSE
626|"but even a little higher than the angels.  For to whom of His angels"|FALSE
626|"has He said at any time:  Thou art a priest for ever after the order of"|FALSE
626|"Melchisedech?  Ye dispense the patrimony of the crucified one to the"|FALSE
626|"poor, wherein it is required of stewards that a man be found faithful."|FALSE
626|"Ye are shepherds of the Lord's flock, as well in example of life as in"|FALSE
626|"the word of doctrine, which is bound to repay you with milk and wool."|FALSE
626|"Who are the givers of all these things, O clerks?  Is it not books?  Do"|FALSE
626|"ye remember therefore, we pray, how many and how great liberties and"|FALSE
626|"privileges are bestowed upon the clergy through us?  In truth, taught"|FALSE
626|"by us who are the vessels of wisdom and intellect, ye ascend the"|FALSE
626|"teacher's chair and are called of men Rabbi.  By us ye become"|FALSE
626|"marvellous in the eyes of the laity, like great lights in the world,"|FALSE
626|"and possess the dignities of the Church according to your various"|FALSE
626|"stations.  By us, while ye still lack the first down upon your cheeks,"|FALSE
626|"ye are established in your early years and bear the tonsure on your"|FALSE
626|"heads, while the dread sentence of the Church is heard: Touch not mine"|FALSE
626|"anointed and do my prophets no harm, and he who has rashly touched them"|FALSE
626|"let him forthwith by his own blow be smitten violently with the wound"|FALSE
626|"of an anathema.  At length yielding your lives to wickedness, reaching"|FALSE
626|"the two paths of Pythagoras, ye choose the left branch, and going"|FALSE
626|"backward ye let go the lot of God which ye had first assumed, becoming"|FALSE
626|"companions of thieves.  And thus ever going from bad to worse, dyed"|FALSE
626|"with theft and murder and manifold impurities, your fame and conscience"|FALSE
626|"stained by sins, at the bidding of justice ye are confined in manacles"|FALSE
626|"and fetters, and are kept to be punished by a most shameful death."|FALSE
626|"Then your friend is put far away, nor is there any to mourn your lot."|FALSE
626|"Peter swears that he knows not the man: the people cry to the judge:"|FALSE
626|"Crucify, crucify Him!  If thou let this man go, thou act not Caesar's"|FALSE
626|"friend.  Now all refuge has perished, for ye must stand before the"|FALSE
626|"judgment-seat, and there is no appeal, but only hanging is in store for"|FALSE
626|"you. While the wretched man's heart is thus filled with woe and only"|FALSE
626|"the sorrowing Muses bedew their cheeks with tears, in his strait is"|FALSE
626|"heard on every side the wailing appeal to us, and to avoid the danger"|FALSE
626|"of impending death he shows the slight sign of the ancient tonsure"|FALSE
626|"which we bestowed upon him, begging that we may be called to his aid"|FALSE
626|"and bear witness to the privilege bestowed upon him.  Then straightway"|FALSE
626|"touched with pity we run to meet the prodigal son and snatch the"|FALSE
626|"fugitive slave from the gates of death.  The book he has not forgotten"|FALSE
626|"is handed to him to be read, and while with lips stammering with fear"|FALSE
626|"he reads a few words, the power of the judge is loosed, the accuser is"|FALSE
626|"withdrawn, and death is put to flight.  O marvellous virtue of an"|FALSE
626|"empiric verse!  O saving antidote of dreadful ruin!  O precious reading"|FALSE
626|"of the psalter, which for this alone deserves to be called the book of"|FALSE
626|"life! Let the laity undergo the judgment of the secular arm, that"|FALSE
626|"either sewn up in sacks they may be carried out to Neptune, or planted"|FALSE
626|"in the earth may fructify for Pluto, or may be offered amid the flames"|FALSE
626|"as a fattened holocaust to Vulcan, or at least may be hung up as a"|FALSE
626|"victim to Juno: while our nursling at a single reading of the book of"|FALSE
626|"life is handed over to the custody of the Bishop, and rigour is changed"|FALSE
626|"to favour, and the forum being transferred from the laity, death is"|FALSE
626|"routed by the clerk who is the nursling of books."|FALSE
626|"But now let us speak of the clerks who are vessels of virtue.  Which of"|FALSE
626|"you about to preach ascends the pulpit or the rostrum without in some"|FALSE
626|"way consulting us?  Which of you enters the schools to teach or to"|FALSE
626|"dispute without relying upon our support?  First of all, it behoves you"|FALSE
626|"to eat the book with Ezechiel, that the belly of your memory may be"|FALSE
626|"sweetened within, and thus as with the panther refreshed, to whose"|FALSE
626|"breath all beasts and cattle long to approach, the sweet savour of the"|FALSE
626|"spices it has eaten may shed a perfume without.  Thus our nature"|FALSE
626|"secretly working in our own, listeners hasten up gladly, as the"|FALSE
626|"load-stone draws the iron nothing loth.  What an infinite host of books"|FALSE
626|"lie at Paris or Athens, and at the same time resound in Britain and in"|FALSE
626|"Rome! In truth, while resting they yet move, and while retaining their"|FALSE
626|"own places they are carried about every way to the minds of listeners."|FALSE
626|"Finally, by the knowledge of literature, we establish Priests, Bishops,"|FALSE
626|"Cardinals, and the Pope, that all things in the ecclesiastical"|FALSE
626|"hierarchy may be fitly disposed.  For it is from books that everything"|FALSE
626|"of good that befalls the clerical condition takes its origin.  But let"|FALSE
626|"this suffice: for it pains us to recall what we have bestowed upon the"|FALSE
626|"degenerate clergy, because whatever gifts are distributed to the"|FALSE
626|"ungrateful seem to be lost rather than bestowed."|FALSE
626|"Let us next dwell a little on the recital of the wrongs with which they"|FALSE
626|"requite us, the contempts and cruelties of which we cannot recite an"|FALSE
626|"example in each kind, nay, scarcely the main classes of the several"|FALSE
626|"wrongs.  In the first place, we are expelled by force and arms from the"|FALSE
626|"homes of the clergy, which are ours by hereditary right, who were used"|FALSE
626|"to have cells of quietness in the inner chamber, but, alas! in these"|FALSE
626|"unhappy times we are altogether exiled, suffering poverty without the"|FALSE
626|"gates.  For our places are seized now by dogs, now by hawks, now by"|FALSE
626|"that biped beast whose cohabitation with the clergy was forbidden of"|FALSE
626|"old, from which we have always taught our nurslings to flee more than"|FALSE
626|"from the asp and the cockatrice; wherefore she, always jealous of the"|FALSE
626|"love of us, and never to be appeased, at length seeing us in some"|FALSE
626|"corner protected only by the web of some dead spider, with a frown"|FALSE
626|"abuses and reviles us with bitter words, declaring us alone of all the"|FALSE
626|"furniture in the house to be unnecessary, and complaining that we are"|FALSE
626|"useless for any household purpose, and advises that we should speedily"|FALSE
626|"be converted into rich caps, sendal and silk and twice-dyed purple,"|FALSE
626|"robes and furs, wool and linen: and, indeed, not without reason, if she"|FALSE
626|"could see our inmost hearts, if she had listened to our secret"|FALSE
626|"counsels, if she had read the book of Theophrastus or Valerius, or only"|FALSE
626|"heard the twenty-fifth chapter of Ecclesiasticus with understanding"|FALSE
626|"ears."|FALSE
626|"And hence it is that we have to mourn for the homes of which we have"|FALSE
626|"been unjustly robbed; and as to our coverings, not that they have not"|FALSE
626|"been given to us, but that the coverings anciently given to us have"|FALSE
626|"been torn by violent hands, insomuch that our soul is bowed down to the"|FALSE
626|"dust, our belly cleaveth unto the earth.  We suffer from various"|FALSE
626|"diseases, enduring pains in our backs and sides; we lie with our limbs"|FALSE
626|"unstrung by palsy, and there is no man who layeth it to heart, and no"|FALSE
626|"man who provides a mollifying plaster.  Our native whiteness that was"|FALSE
626|"clear with light has turned to dun and yellow, so that no leech who"|FALSE
626|"should see us would doubt that we are diseased with jaundice.  Some of"|FALSE
626|"us are suffering from gout, as our twisted extremities plainly show."|FALSE
626|"The smoke and dust by which we are continuously plagued have dulled the"|FALSE
626|"keenness of our visual rays, and are now infecting our bleared eyes"|FALSE
626|"with ophthalmia.  Within we are devoured by the fierce gripings of our"|FALSE
626|"entrails, which hungry worms cease not to gnaw, and we undergo the"|FALSE
626|"corruption of the two Lazaruses, nor is there anyone to anoint us with"|FALSE
626|"balm of cedar, nor to cry to us who have been four days dead and"|FALSE
626|"already stink, Lazarus come forth!  No healing drug is bound around our"|FALSE
626|"cruel wounds, which are so atrociously inflicted upon the innocent, and"|FALSE
626|"there is none to put a plaster upon our ulcers; but ragged and"|FALSE
626|"shivering we are flung away into dark corners, or in tears take our"|FALSE
626|"place with holy Job upon his dunghill, or--too horrible to relate--are"|FALSE
626|"buried in the depths of the common sewers.  The cushion is withdrawn"|FALSE
626|"that should support our evangelical sides, which ought to have the"|FALSE
626|"first claim upon the incomes of the clergy, and the common necessaries"|FALSE
626|"of life thus be for ever provided for us, who are entrusted to their"|FALSE
626|"charge."|FALSE
626|"Again, we complain of another sort of injury which is too often"|FALSE
626|"unjustly inflicted upon our persons.  We are sold for bondmen and"|FALSE
626|"bondwomen, and lie as hostages in taverns with no one to redeem us.  We"|FALSE
626|"fall a prey to the cruel shambles, where we see sheep and cattle"|FALSE
626|"slaughtered not without pious tears, and where we die a thousand times"|FALSE
626|"from such terrors as might frighten even the brave.  We are handed over"|FALSE
626|"to Jews, Saracens, heretics and infidels, whose poison we always dread"|FALSE
626|"above everything, and by whom it is well known that some of our parents"|FALSE
626|"have been infected with pestiferous venom.  In sooth, we who should be"|FALSE
626|"treated as masters in the sciences, and bear rule over the mechanics"|FALSE
626|"who should be subject to us, are instead handed over to the government"|FALSE
626|"of subordinates, as though some supremely noble monarch should be"|FALSE
626|"trodden under foot by rustic heels.  Any seamster or cobbler or tailor"|FALSE
626|"or artificer of any trade keeps us shut up in prison for the luxurious"|FALSE
626|"and wanton pleasures of the clergy."|FALSE
626|"Now we would pursue a new kind of injury by which we suffer alike in"|FALSE
626|"person and in fame, the dearest thing we have.  Our purity of race is"|FALSE
626|"diminished every day, while new authors' names are imposed upon us by"|FALSE
626|"worthless compilers, translators, and transformers, and losing our"|FALSE
626|"ancient nobility, while we are reborn in successive generations, we"|FALSE
626|"become wholly degenerate; and thus against our will the name of some"|FALSE
626|"wretched stepfather is affixed to us, and the sons are robbed of the"|FALSE
626|"names of their true fathers.  The verses of Virgil, while he was yet"|FALSE
626|"living, were claimed by an impostor; and a certain Fidentinus"|FALSE
626|"mendaciously usurped the works of Martial, whom Martial thus deservedly"|FALSE

626|"for them after the hour is not to receive them.  Scarcely anyone"|FALSE
626|"observes this devout rule of study after saying the prayers of the"|FALSE

626|"THE COMPLAINT OF BOOKS AGAINST THE MENDICANTS"|FALSE
626|"Poor in spirit, but most rich in faith, off-scourings of the world and"|FALSE
626|"salt of the earth, despisers of the world and fishers of men, how happy"|FALSE
626|"are ye, if suffering penury for Christ ye know how to possess your"|FALSE
626|"souls in patience!  For it is not want the avenger of iniquity, nor the"|FALSE
626|"adverse fortune of your parents, nor violent necessity that has thus"|FALSE
626|"oppressed you with beggary, but a devout will and Christ-like election,"|FALSE
626|"by which ye have chosen that life as the best, which God Almighty made"|FALSE
626|"man as well by word as by example declared to be the best.  In truth,"|FALSE
626|"ye are the latest offspring of the ever-fruitful Church, of late"|FALSE
626|"divinely substituted for the Fathers and the Prophets, that your sound"|FALSE
626|"may go forth into all the earth, and that instructed by our healthful"|FALSE
626|"doctrines ye may preach before all kings and nations the invincible"|FALSE
626|"faith of Christ.  Moreover, that the faith of the Fathers is chiefly"|FALSE
626|"enshrined in books the second chapter has sufficiently shown, from"|FALSE
626|"which it is clearer than light that ye ought to be zealous lovers of"|FALSE
626|"books above all other Christians.  Ye are commanded to sow upon all"|FALSE
626|"waters, because the Most High is no respecter of persons, nor does the"|FALSE
626|"Most Holy desire the death of sinners, who offered Himself to die for"|FALSE
626|"them, but desires to heal the contrite in heart, to raise the fallen,"|FALSE
626|"and to correct the perverse in the spirit of lenity.  For which most"|FALSE
626|"salutary purpose our kindly Mother Church has planted you freely, and"|FALSE
626|"having planted has watered you with favours, and having watered you has"|FALSE
626|"established you with privileges, that ye may be co-workers with pastors"|FALSE
626|"and curates in procuring the salvation of faithful souls.  Wherefore,"|FALSE
626|"that the order of Preachers was principally instituted for the study of"|FALSE
626|"the Holy Scriptures and the salvation of their neighbours, is declared"|FALSE
626|"by their constitutions, so that not only from the rule of Bishop"|FALSE
626|"Augustine, which directs books to be asked for every day, but as soon"|FALSE
626|"as they have read the prologue of the said constitutions they may know"|FALSE
626|"from the very title of the same that they are pledged to the love of"|FALSE
626|"books."|FALSE
626|"But alas! a threefold care of superfluities, viz., of the stomach, of"|FALSE
626|"dress, and of houses, has seduced these men and others following their"|FALSE
626|"example from the paternal care of books, and from their study.  For,"|FALSE
626|"forgetting the providence of the Saviour (who is declared by the"|FALSE
626|"Psalmist to think upon the poor and needy), they are occupied with the"|FALSE
626|"wants of the perishing body, that their feasts may be splendid and"|FALSE
626|"their garments luxurious, against the rule, and the fabrics of their"|FALSE
626|"buildings, like the battlements of castles, carried to a height"|FALSE
626|"incompatible with poverty.  Because of these three things, we books,"|FALSE
626|"who have ever procured their advancement and have granted them to sit"|FALSE
626|"among the powerful and noble, are put far from their heart's affection"|FALSE
626|"and are reckoned as superfluities; except that they rely upon some"|FALSE
626|"treatises of small value, from which they derive strange heresies and"|FALSE
626|"apocryphal imbecilities, not for the refreshment of souls, but rather"|FALSE
626|"for tickling the ears of the listeners.  The Holy Scripture is not"|FALSE
626|"expounded, but is neglected and treated as though it were commonplace"|FALSE
626|"and known to all, though very few have touched its hem, and though its"|FALSE
626|"depth is such, as Holy Augustine declares, that it cannot be understood"|FALSE
626|"by the human intellect, however long it may toil with the utmost"|FALSE
626|"intensity of study.  From this he who devotes himself to it"|FALSE
626|"assiduously, if only He will vouchsafe to open the door who has"|FALSE
626|"established the spirit of piety, may unfold a thousand lessons of moral"|FALSE
626|"teaching, which will flourish with the freshest novelty and will"|FALSE
626|"cherish the intelligence of the listeners with the most delightful"|FALSE
626|"savours. Wherefore the first professors of evangelical poverty, after"|FALSE
626|"some slight homage paid to secular science, collecting all their force"|FALSE
626|"of intellect, devoted themselves to labours upon the sacred scripture,"|FALSE
626|"meditating day and night on the law of the Lord.  And whatever they"|FALSE
626|"could steal from their famishing belly, or intercept from their"|FALSE
626|"half-covered body, they thought it the highest gain to spend in buying"|FALSE
626|"or correcting books.  Whose worldly contemporaries observing their"|FALSE
626|"devotion and study bestowed upon them for the edification of the whole"|FALSE
626|"Church the books which they had collected at great expense in the"|FALSE
626|"various parts of the world."|FALSE
626|"In truth, in these days as ye are engaged with all diligence in pursuit"|FALSE
626|"of gain, it may be reasonably believed, if we speak according to human"|FALSE
626|"notions, that God thinks less upon those whom He perceives to distrust"|FALSE
626|"His promises, putting their hope in human providence, not considering"|FALSE
626|"the raven, nor the lilies, whom the Most High feeds and arrays.  Ye do"|FALSE
626|"not think upon Daniel and the bearer of the mess of boiled pottage, nor"|FALSE
626|"recollect Elijah who was delivered from hunger once in the desert by"|FALSE
626|"angels, again in the torrent by ravens, and again in Sarepta by the"|FALSE
626|"widow, through the divine bounty, which gives to all flesh their meat"|FALSE
626|"in due season.  Ye descend (as we fear) by a wretched anticlimax,"|FALSE
626|"distrust of the divine goodness producing reliance upon your own"|FALSE
626|"prudence, and reliance upon your own prudence begetting anxiety about"|FALSE
626|"worldly things, and excessive anxiety about worldly things taking away"|FALSE
626|"the love as well as the study of books; and thus poverty in these days"|FALSE
626|"is abused to the injury of the Word of God, which ye have chosen only"|FALSE
626|"for profit's sake."|FALSE
626|"With summer fruit, as the people gossip, ye attract boys to religion,"|FALSE
626|"whom when they have taken the vows ye do not instruct by fear and"|FALSE
626|"force, as their age requires, but allow them to devote themselves to"|FALSE
626|"begging expeditions, and suffer them to spend the time, in which they"|FALSE
626|"might be learning, in procuring the favour of friends, to the annoyance"|FALSE
626|"of their parents, the danger of the boys, and the detriment of the"|FALSE
626|"order.  And thus no doubt it happens that those who were not compelled"|FALSE
626|"to learn as unwilling boys, when they grow up presume to teach though"|FALSE
626|"utterly unworthy and unlearned, and a small error in the beginning"|FALSE
626|"becomes a very great one in the end.  For there grows up among your"|FALSE
626|"promiscuous flock of laity a pestilent multitude of creatures, who"|FALSE
626|"nevertheless the more shamelessly force themselves into the office of"|FALSE
626|"preaching, the less they understand what they are saying, to the"|FALSE
626|"contempt of the Divine Word and the injury of souls.  In truth, against"|FALSE
626|"the law ye plough with an ox and an ass together, in committing the"|FALSE
626|"cultivation of the Lord's field to learned and unlearned.  Side by"|FALSE
626|"side, it is written, the oxen were ploughing and the asses feeding"|FALSE
626|"beside them: since it is the duty of the discreet to preach, but of the"|FALSE
626|"simple to feed themselves in silence by the hearing of sacred"|FALSE
626|"eloquence.  How many stones ye fling upon the heap of Mercury nowadays!"|FALSE
626|"How many marriages ye procure for the eunuchs of wisdom!  How many"|FALSE
626|"blind watchmen ye bid go round about the walls of the Church!"|FALSE
626|"O idle fishermen, using only the nets of others, which when torn it is"|FALSE
626|"all ye can do to clumsily repair, but can net no new ones of your own!"|FALSE
626|"ye enter on the labours of others, ye repeat the lessons of others, ye"|FALSE
626|"mouth with theatric effort the superficially repeated wisdom of others."|FALSE
626|"As the silly parrot imitates the words that he has heard, so such men"|FALSE
626|"are mere reciters of all, but authors of nothing, imitating Balaam's"|FALSE
626|"ass, which, though senseless of itself, yet became eloquent of speech"|FALSE
626|"and the teacher of its master though a prophet.  Recover yourselves, O"|FALSE
626|"poor in Christ, and studiously regard us books, without which ye can"|FALSE
626|"never be properly shod in the preparation of the Gospel of Peace."|FALSE
626|"Paul the Apostle, preacher of the truth and excellent teacher of the"|FALSE
626|"nations, for all his gear bade three things to be brought to him by"|FALSE
626|"Timothy, his cloak, books and parchments, affording an example to"|FALSE
626|"ecclesiastics that they should wear dress in moderation, and should"|FALSE
626|"have books for aid in study, and parchments, which the Apostle"|FALSE
626|"especially esteems, for writing: AND ESPECIALLY, he says, the"|FALSE
626|"parchments. And truly that clerk is crippled and maimed to his"|FALSE
626|"disablement in many ways, who is entirely ignorant of the art of"|FALSE
626|"writing.  He beats the air with words and edifies only those who are"|FALSE
626|"present, but does nothing for the absent and for posterity.  The man"|FALSE
626|"bore a writer's ink-horn upon his loins, who set a mark Tau upon the"|FALSE
626|"foreheads of the men that sigh and cry, Ezechiel ix.; teaching in a"|FALSE
626|"figure that if any lack skill in writing, he shall not undertake the"|FALSE
626|"task of preaching repentance."|FALSE
626|"Finally, in conclusion of the present chapter, books implore of you:"|FALSE
626|"make your young men who though ignorant are apt of intellect apply"|FALSE
626|"themselves to study, furnishing them with necessaries, that ye may"|FALSE
626|"teach them not only goodness but discipline and science, may terrify"|FALSE
626|"them by blows, charm them by blandishments, mollify them by gifts, and"|FALSE
626|"urge them on by painful rigour, so that they may become at once"|FALSE
626|"Socratics in morals and Peripatetics in learning.  Yesterday, as it"|FALSE
626|"were at the eleventh hour, the prudent householder introduced you into"|FALSE
626|"his vineyard.  Repent of idleness before it is too late: would that"|FALSE
626|"with the cunning steward ye might be ashamed of begging so shamelessly;"|FALSE
626|"for then no doubt ye would devote yourselves more assiduously to us"|FALSE
626|"books and to study."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER VII"|FALSE
626|"THE COMPLAINT OF BOOKS AGAINST WARS"|FALSE
626|"Almighty Author and Lover of peace, scatter the nations that delight in"|FALSE
626|"war, which is above all plagues injurious to books.  For wars being"|FALSE
626|"without the control of reason make a wild assault on everything they"|FALSE
626|"come across, and, lacking the check of reason they push on without"|FALSE
626|"discretion or distinction to destroy the vessels of reason.  Then the"|FALSE
626|"wise Apollo becomes the Python's prey, and Phronesis, the pious mother,"|FALSE
626|"becomes subject to the power of Phrenzy.  Then winged Pegasus is shut"|FALSE
626|"up in the stall of Corydon, and eloquent Mercury is strangled.  Then"|FALSE
626|"wise Pallas is struck down by the dagger of error, and the charming"|FALSE
626|"Pierides are smitten by the truculent tyranny of madness.  O cruel"|FALSE
626|"spectacle!  where you may see the Phoebus of philosophers, the all-wise"|FALSE
626|"Aristotle, whom God Himself made master of the master of the world,"|FALSE
626|"enchained by wicked hands and borne in shameful irons on the shoulders"|FALSE
626|"of gladiators from his sacred home.  There you may see him who was"|FALSE
626|"worthy to be lawgiver to the lawgiver of the world and to hold empire"|FALSE
626|"over its emperor, made the slave of vile buffoons by the most"|FALSE
626|"unrighteous laws of war.  O most wicked power of darkness, which does"|FALSE
626|"not fear to undo the approved divinity of Plato, who alone was worthy"|FALSE
626|"to submit to the view of the Creator, before he assuaged the strife of"|FALSE
626|"warring chaos, and before form had put on its garb of matter, the ideal"|FALSE
626|"types, in order to demonstrate the archetypal universe to its author,"|FALSE
626|"so that the world of sense might be modelled after the supernal"|FALSE
626|"pattern.  O tearful sight! where the moral Socrates, whose acts were"|FALSE
626|"virtue and whose discourse was science, who deduced political justice"|FALSE
626|"from the principles of nature, is seen enslaved to some rascal robber."|FALSE
626|"We bemoan Pythagoras, the parent of harmony, as, brutally scourged by"|FALSE
626|"the harrying furies of war, he utters not a song but the wailings of a"|FALSE
626|"dove.  We mourn, too, for Zeno, who lest he should betray his secret"|FALSE
626|"bit off his tongue and fearlessly spat it out at the tyrant, and now,"|FALSE
626|"alas! is brayed and crushed to death in a mortar by Diomedon."|FALSE
626|"In sooth we cannot mourn with the grief that they deserve all the"|FALSE
626|"various books that have perished by the fate of war in various parts of"|FALSE
626|"the world.  Yet we must tearfully recount the dreadful ruin which was"|FALSE
626|"caused in Egypt by the auxiliaries in the Alexandrian war, when seven"|FALSE
626|"hundred thousand volumes were consumed by fire.  These volumes had been"|FALSE
626|"collected by the royal Ptolemies through long periods of time, as Aulus"|FALSE
626|"Gellius relates.  What an Atlantean progeny must be supposed to have"|FALSE
626|"then perished: including the motions of the spheres, all the"|FALSE
626|"conjunctions of the planets, the nature of the galaxy, and the"|FALSE
626|"prognostic generations of comets, and all that exists in the heavens or"|FALSE
626|"in the ether!  Who would not shudder at such a hapless holocaust, where"|FALSE
626|"ink is offered up instead of blood, where the glowing ashes of"|FALSE
626|"crackling parchment were encarnadined with blood, where the devouring"|FALSE
626|"flames consumed so many thousands of innocents in whose mouth was no"|FALSE
626|"guile, where the unsparing fire turned into stinking ashes so many"|FALSE
626|"shrines of eternal truth!  A lesser crime than this is the sacrifice of"|FALSE
626|"Jephthah or Agamemnon, where a pious daughter is slain by a father's"|FALSE
626|"sword.  How many labours of the famous Hercules shall we suppose then"|FALSE
626|"perished, who because of his knowledge of astronomy is said to have"|FALSE
626|"sustained the heaven on his unyielding neck, when Hercules was now for"|FALSE
626|"the second time cast into the flames.  The secrets of the heavens,"|FALSE
626|"which Jonithus learnt not from man or through man but received by"|FALSE
626|"divine inspiration; what his brother Zoroaster, the servant of unclean"|FALSE
626|"spirits, taught the Bactrians; what holy Enoch, the prefect of"|FALSE

626|"what the first Adam taught his children of the things to come, which he"|FALSE
626|"had seen when caught up in an ecstasy in the book of eternity, are"|FALSE
626|"believed to have perished in those horrid flames.  The religion of the"|FALSE
626|"Egyptians, which the book of the Perfect Word so commends; the"|FALSE
626|"excellent polity of the older Athens, which preceded by nine thousand"|FALSE
626|"years the Athens of Greece; the charms of the Chaldaeans; the"|FALSE
626|"observations of the Arabs and Indians; the ceremonies of the Jews; the"|FALSE

626|"Aesculapius; the grammar of Cadmus; the poems of Parnassus; the oracles"|FALSE
626|"of Apollo; the argonautics of Jason; the stratagems of Palamedes, and"|FALSE
626|"infinite other secrets of science are believed to have perished at the"|FALSE
626|"time of this conflagration."|FALSE
626|"Nay, Aristotle would not have missed the quadrature of the circle, if"|FALSE
626|"only baleful conflicts had spared the books of the ancients, who knew"|FALSE
626|"all the methods of nature.  He would not have left the problem of the"|FALSE
626|"eternity of the world an open question, nor, as is credibly conceived,"|FALSE
626|"would he have had any doubts of the plurality of human intellects and"|FALSE
626|"of their eternity, if the perfect sciences of the ancients had not been"|FALSE
626|"exposed to the calamities of hateful wars.  For by wars we are"|FALSE
626|"scattered into foreign lands, are mutilated, wounded, and shamefully"|FALSE
626|"disfigured, are buried under the earth and overwhelmed in the sea, are"|FALSE
626|"devoured by the flames and destroyed by every kind of death. How much"|FALSE
626|"of our blood was shed by warlike Scipio, when he was eagerly compassing"|FALSE
626|"the overthrow of Carthage, the opponent and rival of the Roman empire!"|FALSE
626|"How many thousands of thousands of us did the ten years' war of Troy"|FALSE
626|"dismiss from the light of day! How many were driven by Anthony, after"|FALSE
626|"the murder of Tully, to seek hiding places in foreign provinces! How"|FALSE
626|"many of us were scattered by Theodoric, while Boethius was in exile,"|FALSE
626|"into the different quarters of the world, like sheep whose shepherd has"|FALSE
626|"been struck down!  How many, when Seneca fell a victim to the cruelty"|FALSE
626|"of Nero, and willing yet unwilling passed the gates of death, took"|FALSE
626|"leave of him and retired in tears, not even knowing in what quarter to"|FALSE
626|"seek for shelter!"|FALSE
626|"Happy was that translation of books which Xerxes is said to have made"|FALSE
626|"to Persia from Athens, and which Seleucus brought back again from"|FALSE
626|"Persia to Athens.  O glad and joyful return!  O wondrous joy, which you"|FALSE
626|"might then see in Athens, when the mother went in triumph to meet her"|FALSE
626|"progeny, and again showed the chambers in which they had been nursed to"|FALSE
626|"her now aging children! Their old homes were restored to their former"|FALSE
626|"inmates, and forthwith boards of cedar with shelves and beams of gopher"|FALSE
626|"wood are most skilfully planed; inscriptions of gold and ivory are"|FALSE
626|"designed for the several compartments, to which the volumes themselves"|FALSE
626|"are reverently brought and pleasantly arranged, so that no one hinders"|FALSE
626|"the entrance of another or injures its brother by excessive crowding."|FALSE
626|"But in truth infinite are the losses which have been inflicted upon the"|FALSE
626|"race of books by wars and tumults.  And as it is by no means possible"|FALSE
626|"to enumerate and survey infinity, we will here finally set up the Gades"|FALSE
626|"of our complaint, and turn again to the prayers with which we began,"|FALSE
626|"humbly imploring that the Ruler of Olympus and the Most High Governor"|FALSE
626|"of all the world will establish peace and dispel wars and make our days"|FALSE
626|"tranquil under His protection."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER VIII"|FALSE
626|"OF THE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE HAD OF COLLECTING A STORE OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"Since to everything there is a season and an opportunity, as the wise"|FALSE
626|"Ecclesiastes witnesseth, let us now proceed to relate the manifold"|FALSE
626|"opportunities through which we have been assisted by the divine"|FALSE
626|"goodness in the acquisition of books."|FALSE
626|"Although from our youth upwards we had always delighted in holding"|FALSE
626|"social commune with learned men and lovers of books, yet when we"|FALSE
626|"prospered in the world and made acquaintance with the King's majesty"|FALSE
626|"and were received into his household, we obtained ampler facilities for"|FALSE
626|"visiting everywhere as we would, and of hunting as it were certain most"|FALSE
626|"choice preserves, libraries private as well as public, and of the"|FALSE
626|"regular as well as of the secular clergy.  And indeed while we filled"|FALSE
626|"various offices to the victorious Prince and splendidly triumphant King"|FALSE
626|"of England, Edward the Third from the Conquest--whose reign may the"|FALSE
626|"Almighty long and peacefully continue--first those about his court, but"|FALSE
626|"then those concerning the public affairs of his kingdom, namely the"|FALSE
626|"offices of Chancellor and Treasurer, there was afforded to us, in"|FALSE
626|"consideration of the royal favour, easy access for the purpose of"|FALSE
626|"freely searching the retreats of books.  In fact, the fame of our love"|FALSE
626|"of them had been soon winged abroad everywhere, and we were reported to"|FALSE
626|"burn with such desire for books, and especially old ones, that it was"|FALSE
626|"more easy for any man to gain our favour by means of books than of"|FALSE
626|"money.  Wherefore, since supported by the goodness of the aforesaid"|FALSE
626|"prince of worthy memory, we were able to requite a man well or ill, to"|FALSE
626|"benefit or injure mightily great as well as small, there flowed in,"|FALSE
626|"instead of presents and guerdons, and instead of gifts and jewels,"|FALSE
626|"soiled tracts and battered codices, gladsome alike to our eye and"|FALSE
626|"heart.  Then the aumbries of the most famous monasteries were thrown"|FALSE
626|"open, cases were unlocked and caskets were undone, and volumes that had"|FALSE
626|"slumbered through long ages in their tombs wake up and are astonished,"|FALSE
626|"and those that had lain hidden in dark places are bathed in the ray of"|FALSE
626|"unwonted light.  These long lifeless books, once most dainty, but now"|FALSE
626|"become corrupt and loathsome, covered with litters of mice and pierced"|FALSE
626|"with the gnawings of the worms, and who were once clothed in purple and"|FALSE
626|"fine linen, now lying in sackcloth and ashes, given up to oblivion,"|FALSE
626|"seemed to have become habitations of the moth.  Natheless among these,"|FALSE
626|"seizing the opportunity, we would sit down with more delight than a"|FALSE
626|"fastidious physician among his stores of gums and spices, and there we"|FALSE
626|"found the object and the stimulus of our affections.  Thus the sacred"|FALSE
626|"vessels of learning came into our control and stewardship; some by"|FALSE
626|"gift, others by purchase, and some lent to us for a season."|FALSE
626|"No wonder that when people saw that we were contented with gifts of"|FALSE
626|"this kind, they were anxious of their own accord to minister to our"|FALSE
626|"needs with those things that they were more willing to dispense with"|FALSE
626|"than the things they secured by ministering to our service.  And in"|FALSE
626|"good will we strove so to forward their affairs that gain accrued to"|FALSE
626|"them, while justice suffered no disparagement.  Indeed, if we had loved"|FALSE
626|"gold and silver goblets, high-bred horses, or no small sums of money,"|FALSE
626|"we might in those days have furnished forth a rich treasury.  But in"|FALSE
626|"truth we wanted manuscripts not moneyscripts; we loved codices more"|FALSE
626|"than florins, and preferred slender pamphlets to pampered palfreys."|FALSE
626|"Besides all this, we were frequently made ambassador of this most"|FALSE
626|"illustrious Prince of everlasting memory, and were sent on the most"|FALSE
626|"various affairs of state, now to the Holy See, now to the Court of"|FALSE
626|"France, and again to various powers of the world, on tedious embassies"|FALSE
626|"and in times of danger, always carrying with us, however, that love of"|FALSE
626|"books which many waters could not quench.  For this like a delicious"|FALSE
626|"draught sweetened the bitterness of our journeyings and after the"|FALSE
626|"perplexing intricacies and troublesome difficulties of causes, and the"|FALSE
626|"all but inextricable labyrinths of public affairs afforded us a little"|FALSE
626|"breathing space to enjoy a balmier atmosphere."|FALSE
626|"O Holy God of gods in Sion, what a mighty stream of pleasure made glad"|FALSE
626|"our hearts whenever we had leisure to visit Paris, the Paradise of the"|FALSE
626|"world, and to linger there; where the days seemed ever few for the"|FALSE
626|"greatness of our love! There are delightful libraries, more aromatic"|FALSE
626|"than stores of spicery; there are luxuriant parks of all manner of"|FALSE
626|"volumes; there are Academic meads shaken by the tramp of scholars;"|FALSE
626|"there are lounges of Athens; walks of the Peripatetics; peaks of"|FALSE
626|"Parnassus; and porches of the Stoics.  There is seen the surveyor of"|FALSE
626|"all arts and sciences Aristotle, to whom belongs all that is most"|FALSE
626|"excellent in doctrine, so far as relates to this passing sublunary"|FALSE
626|"world; there Ptolemy measures epicycles and eccentric apogees and the"|FALSE
626|"nodes of the planets by figures and numbers; there Paul reveals the"|FALSE
626|"mysteries; there his neighbour Dionysius arranges and distinguishes the"|FALSE
626|"hierarchies; there the virgin Carmentis reproduces in Latin characters"|FALSE
626|"all that Cadmus collected in Phoenician letters; there indeed opening"|FALSE
626|"our treasuries and unfastening our purse-strings we scattered money"|FALSE
626|"with joyous heart and purchased inestimable books with mud and sand."|FALSE
626|"It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer.  But in vain; for behold"|FALSE
626|"how good and how pleasant it is to gather together the arms of the"|FALSE
626|"clerical warfare, that we may have the means to crush the attacks of"|FALSE
626|"heretics, if they arise."|FALSE
626|"Further, we are aware that we obtained most excellent opportunities of"|FALSE
626|"collecting in the following way.  From our early years we attached to"|FALSE
626|"our society with the most exquisite solicitude and discarding all"|FALSE
626|"partiality all such masters and scholars and professors in the several"|FALSE
626|"faculties as had become most distinguished by their subtlety of mind"|FALSE
626|"and the fame of their learning.  Deriving consolation from their"|FALSE
626|"sympathetic conversation, we were delightfully entertained, now by"|FALSE
626|"demonstrative chains of reasoning, now by the recital of physical"|FALSE
626|"processes and the treatises of the doctors of the Church, now by"|FALSE
626|"stimulating discourses on the allegorical meanings of things, as by a"|FALSE
626|"rich and well-varied intellectual feast.  Such men we chose as comrades"|FALSE
626|"in our years of learning, as companions in our chamber, as associates"|FALSE
626|"on our journeys, as guests at our table, and, in short, as helpmates in"|FALSE
626|"all the vicissitudes of life.  But as no happiness is permitted to"|FALSE
626|"endure for long, we were sometimes deprived of the bodily companionship"|FALSE
626|"of some of these shining lights, when justice looking down from heaven,"|FALSE
626|"the ecclesiastical preferments and dignities that they deserved fell to"|FALSE
626|"their portion.  And thus it happened, as was only right, that in"|FALSE
626|"attending to their own cures they were obliged to absent themselves"|FALSE
626|"from attendance upon us."|FALSE
626|"We will add yet another very convenient way by which a great multitude"|FALSE
626|"of books old as well as new came into our hands.  For we never regarded"|FALSE
626|"with disdain or disgust the poverty of the mendicant orders, adopted"|FALSE
626|"for the sake of Christ; but in all parts of the world took them into"|FALSE
626|"the kindly arms of our compassion, allured them by the most friendly"|FALSE
626|"familiarity into devotion to ourselves, and having so allured them"|FALSE
626|"cherished them with munificent liberality of beneficence for the sake"|FALSE
626|"of God, becoming benefactors of all of them in general in such wise"|FALSE
626|"that we seemed none the less to have adopted certain individuals with a"|FALSE
626|"special fatherly affection.  To these men we were as a refuge in every"|FALSE
626|"case of need, and never refused to them the shelter of our favour,"|FALSE
626|"wherefore we deserved to find them most special furtherers of our"|FALSE
626|"wishes and promoters thereof in act and deed, who compassing land and"|FALSE
626|"sea, traversing the circuit of the world, and ransacking the"|FALSE
626|"universities and high schools of various provinces, were zealous in"|FALSE
626|"combatting for our desires, in the sure and certain hope of reward."|FALSE
626|"What leveret could escape amidst so many keen-sighted hunters?  What"|FALSE
626|"little fish could evade in turn their hooks and nets and snares?  From"|FALSE
626|"the body of the Sacred Law down to the booklet containing the fallacies"|FALSE
626|"of yesterday, nothing could escape these searchers.  Was some devout"|FALSE
626|"discourse uttered at the fountain-head of Christian faith, the holy"|FALSE
626|"Roman Curia, or was some strange question ventilated with novel"|FALSE
626|"arguments; did the solidity of Paris, which is now more zealous in the"|FALSE
626|"study of antiquity than in the subtle investigation of truth, did"|FALSE
626|"English subtlety, which illumined by the lights of former times is"|FALSE
626|"always sending forth fresh rays of truth, produce anything to the"|FALSE
626|"advancement of science or the declaration of the faith, this was"|FALSE
626|"instantly poured still fresh into our ears, ungarbled by any babbler,"|FALSE
626|"unmutilated by any trifler, but passing straight from the purest of"|FALSE
626|"wine-presses into the vats of our memory to be clarified."|FALSE
626|"But whenever it happened that we turned aside to the cities and places"|FALSE
626|"where the mendicants we have mentioned had their convents, we did not"|FALSE
626|"disdain to visit their libraries and any other repositories of books;"|FALSE
626|"nay, there we found heaped up amid the utmost poverty the utmost riches"|FALSE
626|"of wisdom.  We discovered in their fardels and baskets not only crumbs"|FALSE
626|"falling from the masters' table for the dogs, but the shewbread without"|FALSE
626|"leaven and the bread of angels having in it all that is delicious; and"|FALSE
626|"indeed the garners of Joseph full of corn, and all the spoil of the"|FALSE
626|"Egyptians, and the very precious gifts which Queen Sheba brought to"|FALSE
626|"Solomon."|FALSE
626|"These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the summer, and"|FALSE
626|"ingenious bees continually fabricating  cells of honey.  They are"|FALSE
626|"successors of Bezaleel in devising all manner of workmanship in silver"|FALSE
626|"and gold and precious stones for decorating the temple of the Church."|FALSE
626|"They are cunning embroiderers, who fashion the breastplate and ephod of"|FALSE
626|"the high priest and all the various vestments of the priests.  They"|FALSE
626|"fashion the curtains of linen and hair and coverings of ram's skins"|FALSE
626|"dyed red with which to adorn the tabernacle of the Church militant."|FALSE
626|"They are husbandmen that sow, oxen treading out corn, sounding"|FALSE
626|"trumpets, shining Pleiades and stars remaining in their courses, which"|FALSE
626|"cease not to fight against Sisera.  And to pay due regard to truth,"|FALSE
626|"without prejudice to the judgment of any, although they lately at the"|FALSE
626|"eleventh hour have entered the lord's vineyard, as the books that are"|FALSE
626|"so fond of us eagerly declared in our sixth chapter, they have added"|FALSE
626|"more in this brief hour to the stock of the sacred books than all the"|FALSE
626|"other vine-dressers; following in the footsteps of Paul, the last to be"|FALSE
626|"called but the first in preaching, who spread the gospel of Christ more"|FALSE
626|"widely than all others.  Of these men, when we were raised to the"|FALSE
626|"episcopate we had several of both orders, viz., the Preachers and"|FALSE
626|"Minors, as personal attendants and companions at our board, men"|FALSE
626|"distinguished no less in letters than in morals, who devoted themselves"|FALSE
626|"with unwearied zeal to the correction, exposition, tabulation, and"|FALSE
626|"compilation of various volumes.  But although we have acquired a very"|FALSE
626|"numerous store of ancient as well as modern works by the manifold"|FALSE
626|"intermediation of the religious, yet we must laud the Preachers with"|FALSE
626|"special praise, in that we have found them above all the religious most"|FALSE
626|"freely communicative of their stores without jealousy, and proved them"|FALSE
626|"to be imbued with an almost Divine liberality, not greedy but fitting"|FALSE
626|"possessors of luminous wisdom."|FALSE
626|"Besides all the opportunities mentioned above, we secured the"|FALSE
626|"acquaintance of stationers and booksellers, not only within our own"|FALSE
626|"country, but of those spread over the realms of France, Germany, and"|FALSE
626|"Italy, money flying forth in abundance to anticipate their demands; nor"|FALSE
626|"were they hindered by any distance or by the fury of the seas, or by"|FALSE
626|"the lack of means for their expenses, from sending or bringing to us"|FALSE
626|"the books that we required.  For they well knew that their expectations"|FALSE
626|"of our bounty would not be defrauded, but that ample repayment with"|FALSE
626|"usury was to be found with us."|FALSE
626|"Nor, finally, did our good fellowship, which aimed to captivate the"|FALSE
626|"affection of all, overlook the rectors of schools and the instructors"|FALSE
626|"of rude boys.  But rather, when we had an opportunity, we entered their"|FALSE
626|"little plots and gardens and gathered sweet-smelling flowers from the"|FALSE
626|"surface and dug up their roots, obsolete indeed, but still useful to"|FALSE
626|"the student, which might, when their rank barbarism was digested heal"|FALSE
626|"the pectoral arteries with the gift of eloquence.  Amongst the mass of"|FALSE
626|"these things we found some greatly meriting to be restored, which when"|FALSE
626|"skilfully cleansed and freed from the disfiguring rust of age, deserved"|FALSE
626|"to be renovated into comeliness of aspect.  And applying in full"|FALSE
626|"measure the necessary means, as a type of the resurrection to come, we"|FALSE
626|"resuscitated them and restored them again to new life and health."|FALSE
626|"Moreover, we had always in our different manors no small multitude of"|FALSE
626|"copyists and scribes, of binders, correctors, illuminators, and"|FALSE
626|"generally of all who could usefully labour in the service of books."|FALSE
626|"Finally, all of both sexes and of every rank or position who had any"|FALSE
626|"kind of association with books, could most easily open by their"|FALSE
626|"knocking the door of our heart, and find a fit resting-place in our"|FALSE
626|"affection and favour.  In so much did we receive those who brought"|FALSE
626|"books, that the multitude of those who had preceded them did not lessen"|FALSE
626|"the welcome of the after-comers, nor were the favours we had awarded"|FALSE
626|"yesterday prejudicial to those of to-day.  Wherefore, ever using all"|FALSE
626|"the persons we have named as a kind of magnets to attract books, we had"|FALSE
626|"the desired accession of the vessels of science and a multitudinous"|FALSE
626|"flight of the finest volumes."|FALSE
626|"And this is what we undertook to narrate in the present chapter."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER IX"|FALSE
626|"HOW, ALTHOUGH WE PREFERRED THE WORKS OF THE ANCIENTS, WE HAVE NOT"|FALSE
626|"CONDEMNED THE STUDIES OF THE MODERNS"|FALSE
626|"Although the novelties of the moderns were never disagreeable to our"|FALSE
626|"desires, who have always cherished with grateful affection those who"|FALSE
626|"devote themselves to study and who add anything either ingenious or"|FALSE
626|"useful to the opinions of our forefathers, yet we have always desired"|FALSE
626|"with more undoubting avidity to investigate the well-tested labours of"|FALSE
626|"the ancients.  For whether they had by nature a greater vigour of"|FALSE
626|"mental sagacity, or whether they perhaps indulged in closer application"|FALSE
626|"to study, or whether they were assisted in their progress by both these"|FALSE
626|"things, one thing we are perfectly clear about, that their successors"|FALSE
626|"are barely capable of discussing the discoveries of their forerunners,"|FALSE
626|"and of acquiring those things as pupils which the ancients dug out by"|FALSE
626|"difficult efforts of discovery.  For as we read that the men of old"|FALSE
626|"were of a more excellent degree of bodily development than modern times"|FALSE
626|"are found to produce, it is by no means absurd to suppose that most of"|FALSE
626|"the ancients were distinguished by brighter faculties, seeing that in"|FALSE
626|"the labours they accomplished of both kinds they are inimitable by"|FALSE
626|"posterity.   And so Phocas writes in the prologue to his Grammar:"|FALSE
626|"     Since all things have been said by men of sense"|FALSE
626|"     The only novelty is--to condense."|FALSE
626|"But in truth, if we speak of fervour of learning and diligence in"|FALSE
626|"study, they gave up all their lives to philosophy; while nowadays our"|FALSE
626|"contemporaries carelessly spend a few years of hot youth, alternating"|FALSE
626|"with the excesses of vice, and when the passions have been calmed, and"|FALSE
626|"they have attained the capacity of discerning truth so difficult to"|FALSE
626|"discover, they soon become involved in worldly affairs and retire,"|FALSE
626|"bidding farewell to the schools of philosophy.  They offer the fuming"|FALSE
626|"must of their youthful intellect to the  difficulties of philosophy,"|FALSE
626|"and bestow the clearer wine upon the money-making business of life."|FALSE
626|"Further, as Ovid in the first book of the De Vetula justly complains:"|FALSE
626|"  The hearts of all men after gold aspire;"|FALSE
626|"  Few study to be wise, more to acquire:"|FALSE
626|"  Thus, Science! all thy virgin charms are sold,"|FALSE
626|"  Whose chaste embraces should disdain their gold,"|FALSE
626|"  Who seek not thee thyself, but pelf through thee,"|FALSE
626|"  Longing for riches, not philosophy."|FALSE
626|"And further on:"|FALSE
626|"  Thus Philosophy is seen"|FALSE
626|"  Exiled, and Philopecuny is queen,"|FALSE
626|"which is known to be the most violent poison of learning."|FALSE
626|"How the ancients indeed regarded life as the only limit of study, is"|FALSE
626|"shown by Valerius, in his book addressed to Tiberius, by many examples."|FALSE
626|"Carneades, he says, was a laborious and lifelong soldier of wisdom:"|FALSE
626|"after he had lived ninety years, the same day put an end to his life"|FALSE
626|"and his philosophizing.  Isocrates in his ninety-fourth year wrote a"|FALSE
626|"most noble work.  Sophocles did the same when nearly a hundred years"|FALSE
626|"old.  Simonides wrote poems in his eightieth year.  Aulus Gellius did"|FALSE
626|"not desire to live longer than he should be able to write, as he says"|FALSE
626|"himself in the prologue to the Noctes Atticae."|FALSE
626|"The fervour of study which possessed Euclid the Socratic, Taurus the"|FALSE
626|"philosopher used to relate to incite young men to study, as Gellius"|FALSE
626|"tells in the book we have mentioned.  For the Athenians, hating the"|FALSE
626|"people of Megara, decreed that if any of the Megarensians entered"|FALSE
626|"Athens, he should be put to death.  Then Euclid, who was a Megarensian,"|FALSE
626|"and had attended the lectures of Socrates before this decree,"|FALSE
626|"disguising himself in a woman's dress, used to go from Megara to Athens"|FALSE
626|"by night to hear Socrates, a distance of twenty miles and back."|FALSE
626|"Imprudent and excessive was the fervour of Archimedes, a lover of"|FALSE
626|"geometry, who would not declare his name, nor lift his head from the"|FALSE
626|"diagram he had drawn, by which he might have prolonged his life, but"|FALSE
626|"thinking more of study than of life dyed with his life-blood the figure"|FALSE
626|"he was studying."|FALSE
626|"There are very many such examples of our proposition, but the brevity"|FALSE
626|"we aim at does not allow us to recall them.  But, painful to relate,"|FALSE
626|"the clerks who are famous in these days pursue a very different course."|FALSE
626|"Afflicted with ambition in their tender years, and slightly fastening"|FALSE
626|"to their untried arms the Icarian wings of presumption, they"|FALSE
626|"prematurely snatch the master's cap; and mere boys become unworthy"|FALSE
626|"professors of the several faculties, through which they do not make"|FALSE
626|"their way step by step, but like goats ascend by leaps and bounds; and,"|FALSE
626|"having slightly tasted of the mighty stream, they think that they have"|FALSE
626|"drunk it dry, though their throats are hardly moistened.  And because"|FALSE
626|"they are not grounded in the first rudiments at the fitting time, they"|FALSE
626|"build a tottering edifice on an unstable foundation, and now that they"|FALSE
626|"have grown up, they are ashamed to learn what they ought to have"|FALSE
626|"learned while young, and thus they are compelled to suffer for ever for"|FALSE
626|"too hastily jumping at dignities they have not deserved.  For these and"|FALSE
626|"the like reasons the tyros in the schools do not attain to the solid"|FALSE
626|"learning of the ancients in a few short hours of study, although they"|FALSE
626|"may enjoy distinctions, may be accorded titles, be authorized by"|FALSE
626|"official robes, and solemnly installed in the chairs of the elders."|FALSE
626|"Just snatched from the cradle and hastily weaned, they mouth the rules"|FALSE
626|"of Priscian and Donatus; while still beardless boys they gabble with"|FALSE
626|"childish stammering the Categorics and Peri Hermeneias, in the writing"|FALSE
626|"of which the great Aristotle is said to have dipped his pen in his"|FALSE
626|"heart's blood.  Passing through these faculties with baneful haste and"|FALSE
626|"a harmful diploma, they lay violent hands upon Moses, and sprinkling"|FALSE
626|"about their faces dark waters and thick clouds of the skies, they offer"|FALSE
626|"their heads, unhonoured by the snows of age, for the mitre of the"|FALSE
626|"pontificate. This pest is greatly encouraged, and they are helped to"|FALSE
626|"attain this fantastic clericate with such nimble steps, by Papal"|FALSE
626|"provisions obtained by insidious prayers, and also by the prayers,"|FALSE
626|"which may not be rejected, of cardinals and great men, by the cupidity"|FALSE
626|"of friends and relatives, who, building up Sion in blood, secure"|FALSE
626|"ecclesiastical dignities for their nephews and pupils, before they are"|FALSE
626|"seasoned by the course of nature or ripeness of learning."|FALSE
626|"Alas! by the same disease which we are deploring, we see that the"|FALSE
626|"Palladium of Paris has been carried off in these sad times of ours,"|FALSE
626|"wherein the zeal of that noble university, whose rays once shed light"|FALSE
626|"into every corner of the world, has grown lukewarm, nay, is all but"|FALSE
626|"frozen.  There the pen of every scribe is now at rest, generations of"|FALSE
626|"books no longer succeed each other, and there is none who begins to"|FALSE
626|"take place as a new author.  They wrap up their doctrines in unskilled"|FALSE
626|"discourse, and are losing all propriety of logic, except that our"|FALSE
626|"English subtleties, which they denounce in public, are the subject of"|FALSE
626|"their furtive vigils."|FALSE
626|"Admirable Minerva seems to bend her course to all the nations of the"|FALSE
626|"earth, and reacheth from end to end mightily, that she may reveal"|FALSE
626|"herself to all mankind.  We see that she has already visited the"|FALSE
626|"Indians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians and Greeks, the Arabs and the"|FALSE
626|"Romans.  Now she has passed by Paris, and now has happily come to"|FALSE
626|"Britain, the most noble of islands, nay, rather a microcosm in itself,"|FALSE
626|"that she may show herself a debtor both to the Greeks and to the"|FALSE
626|"Barbarians.  At which wondrous sight it is conceived by most men, that"|FALSE
626|"as philosophy is now lukewarm in France, so her soldiery are unmanned"|FALSE
626|"and languishing."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER X"|FALSE
626|"OF THE GRADUAL PERFECTING OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"While assiduously seeking out the wisdom of the men of old, according"|FALSE
626|"to the counsel of the Wise Man (Eccles. xxxix.):  The wise man, he"|FALSE
626|"says, will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients, we have not thought"|FALSE
626|"fit to be misled into the opinion that the first founders of the arts"|FALSE
626|"have purged away all crudeness, knowing that the discoveries of each of"|FALSE
626|"the faithful, when weighed in a faithful balance, makes a tiny portion"|FALSE
626|"of science, but that by the anxious investigations of a multitude of"|FALSE
626|"scholars, each as it were contributing his share, the mighty bodies of"|FALSE
626|"the sciences have grown by successive augmentations to the immense bulk"|FALSE
626|"that we now behold.  For the disciples, continually melting down the"|FALSE
626|"doctrines of their masters, and passing them again through the furnace,"|FALSE
626|"drove off the dross that had been previously overlooked, until there"|FALSE
626|"came out refined gold tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times"|FALSE
626|"to perfection, and stained by no admixture of error or doubt."|FALSE
626|"For not even Aristotle, although a man of gigantic intellect, in whom"|FALSE
626|"it pleased Nature to try how much of reason she could bestow upon"|FALSE
626|"mortality, and whom the Most High made only a little lower than the"|FALSE
626|"angels, sucked from his own fingers those wonderful volumes which the"|FALSE
626|"whole world can hardly contain.  But, on the contrary, with lynx-eyed"|FALSE
626|"penetration he had seen through the sacred books of the Hebrews, the"|FALSE
626|"Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Chaldaeans, the Persians and the Medes,"|FALSE
626|"all of which learned Greece had transferred into her treasuries.  Whose"|FALSE
626|"true sayings he received, but smoothed away their crudities, pruned"|FALSE
626|"their superfluities, supplied their deficiencies, and removed their"|FALSE
626|"errors.  And he held that we should give thanks not only to those who"|FALSE
626|"teach rightly, but even to those who err, as affording the way of more"|FALSE
626|"easily investigating truth, as he plainly declares in the second book"|FALSE
626|"of his Metaphysics.  Thus many learned lawyers contributed to the"|FALSE
626|"Pandects, many physicians to the Tegni, and it was by this means that"|FALSE
626|"Avicenna edited his Canon, and Pliny his great work on Natural History,"|FALSE
626|"and Ptolemy the Almagest."|FALSE
626|"For as in the writers of annals it is not difficult to see that the"|FALSE
626|"later writer always presupposes the earlier, without whom he could by"|FALSE
626|"no means relate the former times, so too we are to think of the authors"|FALSE
626|"of the sciences.  For no man by himself has brought forth any science,"|FALSE
626|"since between the earliest students and those of the latter time we"|FALSE
626|"find intermediaries, ancient if they be compared with our own age, but"|FALSE
626|"modern if we think of the foundations of learning, and these men we"|FALSE
626|"consider the most learned.  What would Virgil, the chief poet among the"|FALSE
626|"Latins, have achieved, if he had not despoiled Theocritus, Lucretius,"|FALSE
626|"and Homer, and had not ploughed with their heifer?  What, unless again"|FALSE
626|"and again he had read somewhat of Parthenius and Pindar, whose"|FALSE
626|"eloquence he could by no means imitate?  What could Sallust, Tully,"|FALSE
626|"Boethius, Macrobius, Lactantius, Martianus, and in short the whole"|FALSE
626|"troop of Latin writers have done, if they had not seen the productions"|FALSE
626|"of Athens or the volumes of the Greeks?  Certes, little would Jerome,"|FALSE
626|"master of three languages, Ambrosius, Augustine, though he confesses"|FALSE
626|"that he hated Greek, or even Gregory, who is said to have been wholly"|FALSE
626|"ignorant of it, have contributed to the doctrine of the Church, if more"|FALSE
626|"learned Greece had not furnished them from its stores.  As Rome,"|FALSE
626|"watered by the streams of Greece, had earlier brought forth"|FALSE
626|"philosophers in the image of the Greeks, in like fashion afterwards it"|FALSE
626|"produced doctors of the orthodox faith.  The creeds we chant are the"|FALSE
626|"sweat of Grecian brows, promulgated by their Councils, and established"|FALSE
626|"by the martyrdom of many."|FALSE
626|"Yet their natural slowness, as it happens, turns to the glory of the"|FALSE
626|"Latins, since as they were less learned in their studies, so they were"|FALSE
626|"less perverse in their errors.  In truth, the Arian heresy had all but"|FALSE
626|"eclipsed the whole Church; the Nestorian wickedness presumed to rave"|FALSE
626|"with blasphemous rage against the Virgin, for it would have robbed the"|FALSE
626|"Queen of Heaven, not in open fight but in disputation, of her name and"|FALSE
626|"character as Mother of God, unless the invincible champion Cyril, ready"|FALSE
626|"to do single battle, with the help of the Council of Ephesus, had in"|FALSE
626|"vehemence of spirit utterly extinguished it.  Innumerable are the forms"|FALSE
626|"as well as the authors of Greek heresies; for as they were the original"|FALSE
626|"cultivators of our holy faith, so too they were the first sowers of"|FALSE
626|"tares, as is shown by veracious history.  And thus they went on from"|FALSE
626|"bad to worse, because in endeavouring to part the seamless vesture of"|FALSE
626|"the Lord, they totally destroyed primitive simplicity of doctrine, and"|FALSE
626|"blinded by the darkness of novelty would fall into the bottomless pit,"|FALSE
626|"unless He provide for them in His inscrutable prerogative, whose wisdom"|FALSE
626|"is past reckoning."|FALSE
626|"Let this suffice; for here we reach the limit of our power of judgment."|FALSE
626|"One thing, however, we conclude from the premises, that the ignorance"|FALSE
626|"of the Greek tongue is now a great hindrance to the study of the Latin"|FALSE
626|"writers, since without it the doctrines of the ancient authors, whether"|FALSE
626|"Christian or Gentile, cannot be understood.  And we must come to a like"|FALSE
626|"judgment as to Arabic in numerous astronomical treatises, and as to"|FALSE
626|"Hebrew as regards the text of the Holy Bible, which deficiencies,"|FALSE
626|"indeed, Clement V.  provides for, if only the bishops would faithfully"|FALSE
626|"observe what they so lightly decree.  Wherefore we have taken care to"|FALSE
626|"provide a Greek as well as a Hebrew grammar for our scholars, with"|FALSE
626|"certain other aids, by the help of which studious readers may greatly"|FALSE
626|"inform themselves in the writing, reading, and understanding of the"|FALSE
626|"said tongues, although only the hearing of them can teach correctness"|FALSE
626|"of idiom."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XI"|FALSE
626|"WHY WE HAVE PREFERRED BOOKS OF LIBERAL LEARNING TO BOOKS OF LAW"|FALSE
626|"That lucrative practice of positive law, designed for the dispensation"|FALSE
626|"of earthly things, the more useful it is found by the children of this"|FALSE
626|"world, so much the less does it aid the children of light in"|FALSE
626|"comprehending the mysteries of holy writ and the secret sacraments of"|FALSE
626|"the faith, seeing that it disposes us peculiarly to the friendship of"|FALSE
626|"the world, by which man, as S.  James testifies, is made the enemy of"|FALSE
626|"God.  Law indeed encourages rather than extinguishes the contentions of"|FALSE
626|"mankind, which are the result of unbounded greed, by complicated laws,"|FALSE
626|"which can be turned either way; though we know that it was created by"|FALSE
626|"jurisconsults and pious princes for the purpose of assuaging these"|FALSE
626|"contentions.  But in truth, as the same science deals with contraries,"|FALSE
626|"and the power of reason can be used to opposite ends, and at the same"|FALSE
626|"the human mind is more inclined to evil, it happens with the practisers"|FALSE
626|"of this science that they usually devote themselves to promoting"|FALSE
626|"contention rather than peace, and instead of quoting laws according to"|FALSE
626|"the intent of the legislator, violently strain the language thereof to"|FALSE
626|"effect their own purposes."|FALSE
626|"Wherefore, although the over-mastering love of books has possessed our"|FALSE
626|"mind from boyhood, and to rejoice in their delights has been our only"|FALSE
626|"pleasure, yet the appetite for the books of the civil law took less"|FALSE
626|"hold of our affections, and we have spent but little labour and expense"|FALSE
626|"in acquiring volumes of this kind.  For they are useful only as the"|FALSE
626|"scorpion in treacle, as Aristotle, the sun of science, has said of"|FALSE
626|"logic in his book De Pomo.  We have noticed a certain manifest"|FALSE
626|"difference of nature between law and science, in that every science is"|FALSE
626|"delighted and desires to open its inward parts and display the very"|FALSE
626|"heart of its principles, and to show forth the roots from which it buds"|FALSE
626|"and flourishes, and that the emanation of its springs may be seen of"|FALSE
626|"all men; for thus from the cognate and harmonious light of the truth of"|FALSE
626|"conclusion  to principles, the whole body of science will be full of"|FALSE
626|"light, having no part dark.  But laws, on the contrary, since they are"|FALSE
626|"only human enactments for the regulation of social life, or the yokes"|FALSE
626|"of princes thrown over the necks of their subjects, refuse to be"|FALSE
626|"brought to the standard of synteresis, the origin of equity, because"|FALSE
626|"they feel that they possess more of arbitrary will than rational"|FALSE
626|"judgment.  Wherefore the judgment of the wise for the most part is that"|FALSE
626|"the causes of laws are not a fit subject of discussion.  In truth, many"|FALSE
626|"laws acquire force by mere custom, not by syllogistic necessity, like"|FALSE
626|"the arts: as Aristotle, the Phoebus of the Schools, urges in the second"|FALSE
626|"book of the Politics, where he confutes the policy of Hippodamus, which"|FALSE
626|"holds out rewards to the inventors of new laws, because to abrogate old"|FALSE
626|"laws and establish new ones is to weaken the force of those which"|FALSE
626|"exist.  For whatever receives its stability from use alone must"|FALSE
626|"necessarily be brought to nought by disuse."|FALSE
626|"From which it is seen clearly enough, that as laws are neither arts nor"|FALSE
626|"sciences, so books of law cannot properly be called books of art or"|FALSE
626|"science.  Nor is this faculty which we may call by a special term"|FALSE
626|"geologia, or the earthly science, to be properly numbered among the"|FALSE
626|"sciences.  Now the books of the liberal arts are so useful to the"|FALSE
626|"divine writings, that without their aid the intellect would vainly"|FALSE
626|"aspire to understand them."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XII"|FALSE
626|"WHY WE HAVE CAUSED BOOKS OF GRAMMAR TO BE SO DILIGENTLY PREPARED"|FALSE
626|"While we were constantly delighting ourselves with the reading of"|FALSE
626|"books, which it was our custom to read or have read to us every day, we"|FALSE
626|"noticed plainly how much the defective knowledge even of a single word"|FALSE
626|"hinders the understanding, as the meaning of no sentence can be"|FALSE
626|"apprehended, if any part of it be not understood.  Wherefore we ordered"|FALSE
626|"the meanings of foreign words to be noted with particular care, and"|FALSE
626|"studied the orthography, prosody, etymology, and syntax in ancient"|FALSE
626|"grammarians with unrelaxing carefulness, and took pains to elucidate"|FALSE
626|"terms that had grown too obscure by age with suitable explanations, in"|FALSE
626|"order to make a smooth path for our students."|FALSE
626|"This is the whole reason why we took care to replace the antiquated"|FALSE
626|"volumes of the grammarians by improved codices, that we might make"|FALSE
626|"royal roads, by which our scholars in time to come might attain without"|FALSE
626|"stumbling to any science."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XIII"|FALSE
626|"WHY WE HAVE NOT WHOLLY NEGLECTED THE FABLES OF THE POETS"|FALSE
626|"All the varieties of attack directed against the poets by the lovers of"|FALSE
626|"naked truth may be repelled by a two-fold defence: either that even in"|FALSE
626|"an unseemly subject-matter we may learn a charming fashion of speech,"|FALSE
626|"or that where a fictitious but becoming subject is handled, natural or"|FALSE
626|"historical truth is pursued under the guise of allegorical fiction."|FALSE
626|"Although it is true that all men naturally desire knowledge, yet they"|FALSE
626|"do not all take the same pleasure in learning.  On the contrary, when"|FALSE
626|"they have experienced the labour of study and find their senses"|FALSE
626|"wearied, most men inconsiderately fling away the nut, before they have"|FALSE
626|"broken the shell and reached the kernel.  For man is naturally fond of"|FALSE
626|"two things, namely, freedom from control and some pleasure in his"|FALSE
626|"activity; for which reason no one without reason submits himself to the"|FALSE
626|"control of others, or willingly engages in any tedious task.  For"|FALSE
626|"pleasure crowns activity, as beauty is a crown to youth, as Aristotle"|FALSE
626|"truly asserts in the tenth book of the Ethics.  Accordingly the wisdom"|FALSE
626|"of the ancients devised a remedy by which to entice the wanton minds of"|FALSE
626|"men by a kind of pious fraud, the delicate Minerva secretly lurking"|FALSE
626|"beneath the mask of pleasure.  We are wont to allure children by"|FALSE
626|"rewards, that they may cheerfully learn what we force them to study"|FALSE
626|"even though they are unwilling.  For our fallen nature does not tend to"|FALSE
626|"virtue with the same enthusiasm with which it rushes into vice.  Horace"|FALSE
626|"has expressed this for us in a brief verse of the Ars Poetica, where he"|FALSE
626|"says:"|FALSE
626|"  All poets sing to profit or delight."|FALSE
626|"And he has plainly intimated the same thing in another verse of the"|FALSE
626|"same book, where he says:"|FALSE
626|"     He hits the mark, who mingles joy with use."|FALSE
626|"How many students of Euclid have been repelled by the Pons Asinorum, as"|FALSE
626|"by a lofty and precipitous rock, which no help of ladders could enable"|FALSE
626|"them to scale!  THIS IS A HARD SAYING, they exclaim, AND WHO CAN"|FALSE
626|"RECEIVE IT.  The child of inconstancy, who ended by wishing to be"|FALSE
626|"transformed into an ass, would perhaps never have given up the study of"|FALSE
626|"philosophy, if he had met him in friendly guise veiled under the cloak"|FALSE
626|"of pleasure; but anon, astonished by Crato's chair and struck dumb by"|FALSE
626|"his endless questions, as by a sudden thunderbolt, he saw no refuge but"|FALSE
626|"in flight."|FALSE
626|"So much we have alleged in defence of the poets; and now we proceed to"|FALSE
626|"show that those who study them with proper intent are not to be"|FALSE
626|"condemned in regard to them.  For our ignorance of one single word"|FALSE
626|"prevents the understanding of a whole long sentence, as was assumed in"|FALSE
626|"the previous chapter.  As now the sayings of the saints frequently"|FALSE
626|"allude to the inventions of the poets, it must needs happen that"|FALSE
626|"through our not knowing the poem referred to, the whole meaning of the"|FALSE
626|"author is completely obscured, and assuredly, as Cassiodorus says in"|FALSE
626|"his book Of the Institutes of Sacred Literature:  Those things are not"|FALSE
626|"to be considered trifles without which great things cannot come to"|FALSE
626|"pass.  It follows therefore that through ignorance of poetry we do not"|FALSE
626|"understand Jerome, Augustine, Boethius, Lactantius, Sidonius, and very"|FALSE
626|"many others, a catalogue of whom would more than fill a long chapter."|FALSE
626|"The Venerable Bede has very clearly discussed and determined this"|FALSE
626|"doubtful point, as is related by that great compiler Gratian, the"|FALSE
626|"repeater of numerous authors, who is as confused in form as he was"|FALSE
626|"eager in collecting matter for his compilation.  Now he writes in his"|FALSE
626|"37th section:  Some read secular literature for pleasure, taking"|FALSE
626|"delight in the inventions and elegant language of the poets; but others"|FALSE
626|"study this literature for the sake of scholarship, that by their"|FALSE
626|"reading they may learn to detest the errors of the Gentiles and may"|FALSE
626|"devoutly apply what they find useful in them to the use of sacred"|FALSE
626|"learning.  Such men study secular literature in a laudable manner. So"|FALSE
626|"far Bede."|FALSE
626|"Taking this salutary instruction to heart, let the detractors of those"|FALSE
626|"who study the poets henceforth hold their peace, and let not those who"|FALSE
626|"are ignorant of these things require that others should be as ignorant"|FALSE
626|"as themselves, for this is the consolation of the wretched.  And"|FALSE
626|"therefore let every man see that his own intentions are upright, and he"|FALSE
626|"may thus make of any subject, observing the limitations of virtue, a"|FALSE
626|"study acceptable to God.  And if he have found profit in poetry, as the"|FALSE
626|"great Virgil relates that he had done in Ennius, he will not have done"|FALSE
626|"amiss."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XIV"|FALSE
626|"WHO OUGHT TO BE SPECIAL LOVERS OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"To him who recollects what has been said before, it is plain and"|FALSE
626|"evident who ought to be the chief lovers of books.  For those who have"|FALSE
626|"most need of wisdom in order to perform usefully the duties of their"|FALSE
626|"position, they are without doubt most especially bound to show more"|FALSE
626|"abundantly to the sacred vessels of wisdom the anxious affection of a"|FALSE
626|"grateful heart.  Now it is the office of the wise man to order rightly"|FALSE
626|"both himself and others, according to the Phoebus of philosophers,"|FALSE
626|"Aristotle, who deceives not nor is deceived in human things.  Wherefore"|FALSE
626|"princes and prelates, judges and doctors, and all other leaders of the"|FALSE
626|"commonwealth, as more than others they have need of wisdom, so more"|FALSE
626|"than others ought they to show zeal for the vessels of wisdom."|FALSE
626|"Boethius, indeed, beheld Philosophy bearing a sceptre in her left hand"|FALSE
626|"and books in her right, by which it is evidently shown to all men that"|FALSE
626|"no one can rightly rule a commonwealth without books. Thou, says"|FALSE
626|"Boethius, speaking to Philosophy, hast sanctioned this saying by the"|FALSE
626|"mouth of Plato, that states would be happy if they were ruled by"|FALSE
626|"students of philosophy, or if their rulers would study philosophy.  And"|FALSE
626|"again, we are taught by the very gesture of the figure that in so far"|FALSE
626|"as the right hand is better than the left, so far the contemplative"|FALSE
626|"life is more worthy than the active life; and at the same time we are"|FALSE
626|"shown that the business of the wise man is to devote himself by turns,"|FALSE
626|"now to the study of truth, and now to the dispensation of temporal"|FALSE
626|"things."|FALSE
626|"We read that Philip thanked the Gods devoutly for having granted that"|FALSE
626|"Alexander should be born in the time of Aristotle, so that educated"|FALSE
626|"under his instruction he might be worthy to rule his father's empire."|FALSE
626|"While Phaeton unskilled in driving becomes the charioteer of his"|FALSE
626|"father's car, he unhappily distributes to mankind the heat of Phoebus,"|FALSE
626|"now by excessive nearness, and now by withdrawing it too far, and so,"|FALSE
626|"lest all beneath him should be imperilled by the closeness of his"|FALSE
626|"driving, justly deserved to be struck by the thunderbolt."|FALSE
626|"The history of the Greeks as well as Romans shows that there were no"|FALSE
626|"famous princes among them who were devoid of literature.  The sacred"|FALSE
626|"law of Moses in prescribing to the king a rule of government, enjoins"|FALSE
626|"him to have a copy made of the book of Divine law (Deut. xvii.)"|FALSE
626|"according to the copy shown by the priests, in which he was to read all"|FALSE
626|"the days of his life.  Certes, God Himself, who hath made and who"|FALSE
626|"fashioneth every day the hearts of every one of us, knows the"|FALSE
626|"feebleness of human memory and the instability of virtuous intentions"|FALSE
626|"in mankind.  Wherefore He has willed that books should be as it were an"|FALSE
626|"antidote to all evil, the reading and use of which He has commanded to"|FALSE
626|"be the healthful daily nourishment of the soul, so that by them the"|FALSE
626|"intellect being refreshed and neither weak nor doubtful should never"|FALSE
626|"hesitate in action.  This subject is elegantly handled by John of"|FALSE
626|"Salisbury, in his Policraticon.  In conclusion, all classes of men who"|FALSE
626|"are conspicuous by the tonsure or the sign of clerkship, against whom"|FALSE
626|"books lifted up their voices in the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters,"|FALSE
626|"are bound to serve books with perpetual veneration."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XV"|FALSE
626|"OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE LOVE OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"It transcends the power of human intellect, however deeply it may have"|FALSE
626|"drunk of the Pegasean fount, to develop fully the title of the present"|FALSE
626|"chapter.  Though one should speak with the tongue of men and angels,"|FALSE
626|"though he should become a Mercury or Tully, though he should grow sweet"|FALSE
626|"with the milky eloquence of Livy, yet he will plead the stammering of"|FALSE
626|"Moses, or with Jeremiah will confess that he is but a boy and cannot"|FALSE
626|"speak, or will imitate Echo rebounding from the mountains.  For we know"|FALSE
626|"that the love of books is the same thing as the love of wisdom, as was"|FALSE
626|"proved in the second chapter.  Now this love is called by the Greek"|FALSE
626|"word philosophy, the whole virtue of which no created intelligence can"|FALSE
626|"comprehend; for she is believed to be the mother of all good things:"|FALSE
626|"Wisdom vii.  She as a heavenly dew extinguishes the heats of fleshly"|FALSE
626|"vices, the intense activity of the mental forces relaxing the vigour of"|FALSE
626|"the animal forces, and slothfulness being wholly put to flight, which"|FALSE
626|"being gone all the bows of Cupid are unstrung."|FALSE
626|"Hence Plato says in the Phaedo:  The philosopher is manifest in this,"|FALSE
626|"that he dissevers the soul from communion with the body.  Love, says"|FALSE
626|"Jerome, the knowledge of the scriptures, and thou wilt not love the"|FALSE
626|"vices of the flesh.  The godlike Xenocrates showed this by the firmness"|FALSE
626|"of his reason, who was declared by the famous hetaera Phryne to be a"|FALSE
626|"statue and not a man, when all her blandishments could not shake his"|FALSE
626|"resolve, as Valerius Maximus relates at length.  Our own Origen showed"|FALSE
626|"this also, who chose rather to be unsexed by the mutilation of himself,"|FALSE
626|"than to be made effeminate by the omnipotence of woman--though it was a"|FALSE
626|"hasty remedy, repugnant alike to nature and to virtue, whose place it"|FALSE
626|"is not to make men insensible to passion, but to slay with the dagger"|FALSE
626|"of reason the passions that spring from instinct."|FALSE
626|"Again, all who are smitten with the love of books think cheaply of the"|FALSE
626|"world and wealth; as Jerome says to Vigilantius:  The same man cannot"|FALSE
626|"love both gold and books.  And thus it has been said in verse:"|FALSE
626|"  No iron-stained hand is fit to handle books,"|FALSE
626|"  Nor he whose heart on gold so gladly looks:"|FALSE
626|"  The same men love not books and money both,"|FALSE
626|"  And books thy herd, O Epicurus, loathe;"|FALSE
626|"  Misers and bookmen make poor company,"|FALSE
626|"  Nor dwell in peace beneath the same roof-tree."|FALSE
626|"  No man, therefore, can serve both books and Mammon."|FALSE
626|"The hideousness of vice is greatly reprobated in books, so that he who"|FALSE
626|"loves to commune with books is led to detest all manner of vice.  The"|FALSE
626|"demon, who derives his name from knowledge, is most effectually"|FALSE
626|"defeated by the knowledge of books, and through books his multitudinous"|FALSE
626|"deceits and the endless labyrinths of his guile are laid bare to those"|FALSE
626|"who read, lest he be transformed into an angel of light and circumvent"|FALSE
626|"the innocent by his wiles.  The reverence of God is revealed to us by"|FALSE
626|"books, the virtues by which He is worshipped are more expressly"|FALSE
626|"manifested, and the rewards are described that are promised by the"|FALSE
626|"truth, which deceives not, neither is deceived.  The truest likeness of"|FALSE
626|"the beatitude to come is the contemplation of the sacred writings, in"|FALSE
626|"which we behold in turn the Creator and the creature, and draw from"|FALSE
626|"streams of perpetual gladness.  Faith is established by the power of"|FALSE
626|"books; hope is strengthened by their solace, insomuch that by patience"|FALSE
626|"and the consolation of scripture we are in good hope.  Charity is not"|FALSE
626|"puffed up, but is edified by the knowledge of true learning, and,"|FALSE
626|"indeed, it is clearer than light that the Church is established upon"|FALSE
626|"the sacred writings."|FALSE
626|"Books delight us, when prosperity smiles upon us; they comfort us"|FALSE
626|"inseparably when stormy fortune frowns on us.  They lend validity to"|FALSE
626|"human compacts, and no serious judgments are propounded without their"|FALSE
626|"help.  Arts and sciences, all the advantages of which no mind can"|FALSE
626|"enumerate, consist in books.  How highly must we estimate the wondrous"|FALSE
626|"power of books, since through them we survey the utmost bounds of the"|FALSE
626|"world and time, and contemplate the things that are as well as those"|FALSE
626|"that are not, as it were in the mirror of eternity.  In books we climb"|FALSE
626|"mountains and scan the deepest gulfs of the abyss; in books we behold"|FALSE
626|"the finny tribes that may not exist outside their native waters,"|FALSE
626|"distinguish the properties of streams and springs and of various lands;"|FALSE
626|"from books we dig out gems and metals and the materials of every kind"|FALSE
626|"of mineral, and learn the virtues of herbs and trees and plants, and"|FALSE
626|"survey at will the whole progeny of Neptune, Ceres, and Pluto."|FALSE
626|"But if we please to visit the heavenly inhabitants, Taurus, Caucasus,"|FALSE
626|"and Olympus are at hand, from which we pass beyond the realms of Juno"|FALSE
626|"and mark out the territories of the seven planets by lines and circles."|FALSE
626|"And finally we traverse the loftiest firmament of all, adorned with"|FALSE
626|"signs, degrees, and figures in the utmost variety.  There we inspect"|FALSE
626|"the antarctic pole, which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard; we admire"|FALSE
626|"the luminous Milky Way and the Zodiac, marvellously and delightfully"|FALSE
626|"pictured with celestial animals.  Thence by books we pass on to"|FALSE
626|"separate substances, that the intellect may greet kindred"|FALSE
626|"intelligences, and with the mind's eye may discern the First Cause of"|FALSE
626|"all things and the Unmoved Mover of infinite virtue, and may immerse"|FALSE
626|"itself in love without end.  See how with the aid of books we attain"|FALSE
626|"the reward of our beatitude, while we are yet sojourners below."|FALSE
626|"Why need we say more?  Certes, just as we have learnt on the authority"|FALSE
626|"of Seneca, leisure without letters is death and the sepulture of the"|FALSE
626|"living, so contrariwise we conclude that occupation with letters or"|FALSE
626|"books is the life of man."|FALSE
626|"Again, by means of books we communicate to friends as well as foes what"|FALSE
626|"we cannot safely entrust to messengers; since the book is generally"|FALSE
626|"allowed access to the chambers of princes, from which the voice of its"|FALSE
626|"author would be rigidly excluded, as Tertullian observes at the"|FALSE
626|"beginning of his Apologeticus.  When shut up in prison and in bonds,"|FALSE
626|"and utterly deprived of bodily liberty, we use books as ambassadors to"|FALSE
626|"our friends, and entrust them with the conduct of our cause, and send"|FALSE
626|"them where to go ourselves would incur the penalty of death.  By the"|FALSE
626|"aid of books we remember things that are past, and even prophesy as to"|FALSE
626|"the future; and things present, which shift and flow, we perpetuate by"|FALSE
626|"committing them to writing."|FALSE
626|"The felicitous studiousness and the studious felicity of the"|FALSE
626|"all-powerful eunuch, of whom we are told in the Acts, who had been so"|FALSE
626|"mightily kindled by the love of the prophetic writings that he ceased"|FALSE
626|"not from his reading by reason of his journey, had banished all thought"|FALSE
626|"of the populous palace of Queen Candace, and had forgotten even the"|FALSE
626|"treasures of which he was the keeper, and had neglected alike his"|FALSE
626|"journey and the chariot in which he rode.  Love of his book alone had"|FALSE
626|"wholly engrossed this domicile of chastity, under whose guidance he"|FALSE
626|"soon deserved to enter the gate of faith.  O gracious love of books,"|FALSE
626|"which by the grace of baptism transformed the child of Gehenna and"|FALSE
626|"nursling of Tartarus into a Son of the Kingdom!"|FALSE
626|"Let the feeble pen now cease from the tenor of an infinite task, lest"|FALSE
626|"it seem foolishly to undertake what in the beginning it confessed to be"|FALSE
626|"impossible to any."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XVI"|FALSE
626|"THAT IT IS MERITORIOUS TO WRITE NEW BOOKS AND TO RENEW THE OLD"|FALSE
626|"Just as it is necessary for the state to prepare arms and to provide"|FALSE
626|"abundant stores of victuals for the soldiers who are to fight for it,"|FALSE
626|"so it is fitting for the Church Militant to fortify itself against the"|FALSE
626|"assaults of pagans and heretics with a multitude of sound writings."|FALSE
626|"But because all the appliances of mortal men with the lapse of time"|FALSE
626|"suffer the decay of mortality, it is needful to replace the volumes"|FALSE
626|"that are worn out with age by fresh successors, that the perpetuity of"|FALSE
626|"which the individual is by its nature incapable may be secured to the"|FALSE
626|"species; and hence it is that the Preacher says: Of making many books"|FALSE
626|"there is no end.  For as the bodies of books, seeing that they are"|FALSE
626|"formed of a combination of contrary elements, undergo a continual"|FALSE
626|"dissolution of their structure, so by the forethought of the clergy a"|FALSE
626|"remedy should be found, by means of which the sacred book paying the"|FALSE
626|"debt of nature may obtain a natural heir and may raise up like seed to"|FALSE
626|"its dead brother, and thus may be verified that saying of"|FALSE
626|"Ecclesiasticus: His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead;"|FALSE
626|"for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.  And thus the"|FALSE
626|"transcription of ancient books is as it were the begetting of fresh"|FALSE
626|"sons, on whom the office of the father may devolve, lest it suffer"|FALSE
626|"detriment.  Now such transcribers are called antiquarii, whose"|FALSE
626|"occupations Cassiodorus confesses please him above all the tasks of"|FALSE
626|"bodily labour, adding: \"Happy effort,\" he says, \"laudable industry, to"|FALSE
626|"preach to men with the hand, to let loose tongues with the fingers,"|FALSE
626|"silently to give salvation to mortals, and to fight with pen and ink"|FALSE
626|"against the illicit wiles of the Evil One.\"  So far Cassiodorus."|FALSE
626|"Moreover, our Saviour exercised the office of the scribe when He"|FALSE
626|"stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground (John viii.), that"|FALSE
626|"no one, however exalted, may think it unworthy of him to do what he"|FALSE
626|"sees the wisdom of God the Father did."|FALSE
626|"O singular serenity of writing, to practise which the Artificer of the"|FALSE
626|"world stoops down, at whose dread name every knee doth bow!  O"|FALSE
626|"venerable handicraft pre-eminent above all other crafts that are"|FALSE
626|"practised by the hand of man, to which our Lord humbly inclines His"|FALSE
626|"breast, to which the finger of God is applied, performing the office of"|FALSE
626|"a pen!  We do not read of the Son of God that He sowed or ploughed,"|FALSE
626|"wove or digged; nor did any other of the mechanic arts befit the divine"|FALSE
626|"wisdom incarnate except to trace letters in writing, that every"|FALSE
626|"gentleman and sciolist may know that fingers are given by God to men"|FALSE
626|"for the task of writing rather than for war.  Wherefore we entirely"|FALSE
626|"approve the judgment of books, wherein they declared in our sixth"|FALSE
626|"chapter the clerk who cannot write to be as it were disabled."|FALSE
626|"God himself inscribes the just in the book of the living; Moses"|FALSE
626|"received the tables of stone written with the finger of God.  Job"|FALSE
626|"desires that he himself that judgeth would write a book.  Belshazzar"|FALSE
626|"trembled when he saw the fingers of a man's hand writing upon the wall,"|FALSE
626|"Mene tekel phares.  I wrote, says Jeremiah, with ink in the book."|FALSE
626|"Christ bids his beloved disciple John, What thou seest write in a book."|FALSE
626|"So the office of the writer is enjoined on Isaiah and on Joshua, that"|FALSE
626|"the act and skill of writing may be commended to future generations."|FALSE
626|"Christ Himself has written on His vesture and on His thigh King of"|FALSE
626|"Kings and Lord of Lords, so that without writing the royal ornaments of"|FALSE
626|"the Omnipotent cannot be made perfect.  Being dead they cease not to"|FALSE
626|"teach, who write books of sacred learning.  Paul did more for building"|FALSE
626|"up the fabric of the Church by writing his holy epistles, than by"|FALSE
626|"preaching by word of mouth to Jews and Gentiles.  He who has attained"|FALSE
626|"the prize continues daily by books, what he long ago began while a"|FALSE
626|"sojourner upon the earth; and thus is fulfilled in the doctors writing"|FALSE
626|"books the saying of the Prophet:  They that turn many to righteousness"|FALSE
626|"shall be as the stars for ever and ever."|FALSE
626|"Moreover, it has been determined by the doctors of the Church that the"|FALSE
626|"longevity of the ancients, before God destroyed the original world by"|FALSE
626|"the Deluge, is to be ascribed to a miracle and not to nature; as though"|FALSE
626|"God granted to them such length of days as was required for finding out"|FALSE
626|"the sciences and writing them in books; amongst which the wonderful"|FALSE
626|"variety of astronomy required, according to Josephus, a period of six"|FALSE
626|"hundred years, to submit it to ocular observation.  Nor, indeed, do"|FALSE
626|"they deny that the fruits of the earth in that primitive age afforded a"|FALSE
626|"more nutritious aliment to men than in our modern times, and thus they"|FALSE
626|"had not only a livelier energy of body, but also a more lengthened"|FALSE
626|"period of vigour; to which it contributed not a little that they lived"|FALSE
626|"according to virtue and denied themselves all luxurious delights."|FALSE
626|"Whoever therefore is by the good gift of God endowed with gift of"|FALSE
626|"science, let him, according to the counsel of the Holy Spirit, write"|FALSE
626|"wisdom in his time of leisure (Eccles.  xxxviii.), that his reward may"|FALSE
626|"be with the blessed and his days may be lengthened in this present"|FALSE
626|"world."|FALSE
626|"And further, if we turn our discourse to the princes of the world, we"|FALSE
626|"find that famous emperors not only attained excellent skill in the art"|FALSE
626|"of writing, but indulged greatly in its practice.  Julius Caesar, the"|FALSE
626|"first and greatest of them all, has left us Commentaries on the Gallic"|FALSE
626|"and the Civil Wars written by himself; he wrote also two books De"|FALSE
626|"Analogia, and two books of Anticatones, and a poem called Iter; and"|FALSE
626|"many other works.  Julius and Augustus devised means of writing one"|FALSE
626|"letter for another, and so concealing what they wrote.  For Julius put"|FALSE
626|"the fourth letter for the first, and so on through the alphabet; whilst"|FALSE
626|"Augustus used the second for the first, the third for the second, and"|FALSE
626|"so throughout.  He is said in the greatest difficulties of affairs"|FALSE
626|"during the Mutinensian War to have read and written and even declaimed"|FALSE
626|"every day.  Tiberius wrote a lyric poem and some Greek verses."|FALSE
626|"Claudius likewise was skilled in both Greek and Latin, and wrote"|FALSE
626|"several books.  But Titus was skilled above all men in the art of"|FALSE
626|"writing, and easily imitated any hand he chose; so that he used to say"|FALSE
626|"that if he had wished it he might have become a most skilful forger."|FALSE
626|"All these things are noted by Suetonius in his Lives of the XII."|FALSE
626|"Caesars."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XVII"|FALSE
626|"OF SHOWING DUE PROPRIETY IN THE CUSTODY OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"We are not only rendering service to God in preparing volumes of new"|FALSE
626|"books, but also exercising an office of sacred piety when we treat"|FALSE
626|"books carefully, and again when we restore them to their proper places"|FALSE
626|"and commend them to inviolable custody; that they may rejoice in purity"|FALSE
626|"while we have them in our hands, and rest securely when they are put"|FALSE
626|"back in their repositories.  And surely next to the vestments and"|FALSE
626|"vessels dedicated to the Lord's body, holy books deserve to be rightly"|FALSE
626|"treated by the clergy, to which great injury is done so often as they"|FALSE
626|"are touched by unclean hands.  Wherefore we deem it expedient to warn"|FALSE
626|"our students of various negligences, which might always be easily"|FALSE
626|"avoided and do wonderful harm to books."|FALSE
626|"And in the first place as to the opening and closing of books, let"|FALSE
626|"there be due moderation, that they be not unclasped in precipitate"|FALSE
626|"haste, nor when we have finished our inspection be put away without"|FALSE
626|"being duly closed.  For it behoves us to guard a book much more"|FALSE
626|"carefully than a boot."|FALSE
626|"But the race of scholars is commonly badly brought up, and unless they"|FALSE
626|"are bridled in by the rules of their elders they indulge in infinite"|FALSE
626|"puerilities.  They behave with petulance, and are puffed up with"|FALSE
626|"presumption, judging of everything as if they were certain, though they"|FALSE
626|"are altogether inexperienced."|FALSE
626|"You may happen to see some headstrong youth lazily lounging over his"|FALSE
626|"studies, and when the winter's frost is sharp, his nose running from"|FALSE
626|"the nipping cold drips down, nor does he think of wiping it with his"|FALSE
626|"pocket-handkerchief until he has bedewed the book before him with the"|FALSE
626|"ugly moisture.  Would that he had before him no book, but a cobbler's"|FALSE
626|"apron!  His nails are stuffed with fetid filth as black as jet, with"|FALSE
626|"which he marks any passage that pleases him.  He distributes a"|FALSE
626|"multitude of straws, which he inserts to stick out in different places,"|FALSE
626|"so that the halm may remind him of what his memory cannot retain."|FALSE
626|"These straws, because the book has no stomach to digest them, and no"|FALSE
626|"one takes them out, first distend the book from its wonted closing, and"|FALSE
626|"at length, being carelessly abandoned to oblivion, go to decay.  He"|FALSE
626|"does not fear to eat fruit or cheese over an open book, or carelessly"|FALSE
626|"to carry a cup to and from his mouth; and because he has no wallet at"|FALSE
626|"hand he drops into books the fragments that are left.  Continually"|FALSE
626|"chattering, he is never weary of disputing with his companions, and"|FALSE
626|"while he alleges a crowd of senseless arguments, he wets the book lying"|FALSE
626|"half open in his lap with sputtering showers.  Aye, and then hastily"|FALSE
626|"folding his arms he leans forward on the book, and by a brief spell of"|FALSE
626|"study invites a prolonged nap; and then, by way of mending the"|FALSE
626|"wrinkles, he folds back the margin of the leaves, to the no small"|FALSE
626|"injury of the book.  Now the rain is over and gone, and the flowers"|FALSE
626|"have appeared in our land.  Then the scholar we are speaking of, a"|FALSE
626|"neglecter rather than an inspecter of books, will stuff his volume with"|FALSE
626|"violets, and primroses, with roses and quatrefoil.  Then he will use"|FALSE
626|"his wet and perspiring hands to turn over the volumes; then he will"|FALSE
626|"thump the white vellum with gloves covered with all kinds of dust, and"|FALSE
626|"with his finger clad in long-used leather will hunt line by line"|FALSE
626|"through the page; then at the sting of the biting flea the sacred book"|FALSE
626|"is flung aside, and is hardly shut for another month, until it is so"|FALSE
626|"full of the dust that has found its way within, that it resists the"|FALSE
626|"effort to close it."|FALSE
626|"But the handling of books is specially to be forbidden to those"|FALSE
626|"shameless youths, who as soon as they have learned to form the shapes"|FALSE
626|"of letters, straightway, if they have the opportunity, become unhappy"|FALSE
626|"commentators, and wherever they find an extra margin about the text,"|FALSE
626|"furnish it with monstrous alphabets, or if any other frivolity strikes"|FALSE
626|"their fancy, at once their pen begins to write it.  There the Latinist"|FALSE
626|"and sophister and every unlearned writer tries the fitness of his pen,"|FALSE
626|"a practice that we have frequently seen injuring the usefulness and"|FALSE
626|"value of the most beautiful books."|FALSE
626|"Again, there is a class of thieves shamefully mutilating books, who cut"|FALSE
626|"away the margins from the sides to use as material for letters, leaving"|FALSE
626|"only the text, or employ the leaves from the ends, inserted for the"|FALSE
626|"protection of the book, for various uses and abuses--a kind of"|FALSE
626|"sacrilege which should be prohibited by the threat of anathema."|FALSE
626|"Again, it is part of the decency of scholars that whenever they return"|FALSE
626|"from meals to their study, washing should invariably precede reading,"|FALSE
626|"and that no grease-stained finger should unfasten the clasps, or turn"|FALSE
626|"the leaves of a book.  Nor let a crying child admire the pictures in"|FALSE
626|"the capital letters, lest he soil the parchment with wet fingers; for a"|FALSE
626|"child instantly touches whatever he sees.  Moreover, the laity, who"|FALSE
626|"look at a book turned upside down just as if it were open in the right"|FALSE
626|"way, are utterly unworthy of any communion with books.  Let the clerk"|FALSE
626|"take care also that the smutty scullion reeking from his stewpots does"|FALSE
626|"not touch the lily leaves of books, all unwashed, but he who walketh"|FALSE
626|"without blemish shall minister to the precious volumes.  And, again,"|FALSE
626|"the cleanliness of decent hands would be of great benefit to books as"|FALSE
626|"well as scholars, if it were not that the itch and pimples are"|FALSE
626|"characteristic of the clergy."|FALSE
626|"Whenever defects are noticed in books, they should be promptly"|FALSE
626|"repaired, since nothing spreads more quickly than a tear and a rent"|FALSE
626|"which is neglected at the time will have to be repaired afterwards with"|FALSE
626|"usury."|FALSE
626|"Moses, the gentlest of men, teaches us to make bookcases most neatly,"|FALSE
626|"wherein they may be protected from any injury: Take, he says, this book"|FALSE
626|"of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the"|FALSE
626|"Lord your God.   O fitting place and appropriate for a library, which"|FALSE
626|"was made of imperishable shittim-wood, and was all covered within and"|FALSE
626|"without with gold!  But the Saviour also has warned us by His example"|FALSE
626|"against all unbecoming carelessness in the handling of books, as we"|FALSE
626|"read in S.  Luke.  For when He had read the scriptural prophecy of"|FALSE
626|"Himself in the book that was delivered to Him, He did not give it again"|FALSE
626|"to the minister, until He had closed it with his own most sacred hands."|FALSE
626|"By which students are most clearly taught that in the care of books the"|FALSE
626|"merest trifles ought not to be neglected."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XVIII"|FALSE
626|"SHOWETH THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED SO GREAT STORE OF BOOKS FOR THE COMMON"|FALSE
626|"BENEFIT OF SCHOLARS AND NOT ONLY FOR OUR OWN PLEASURE"|FALSE
626|"Nothing in human affairs is more unjust than that those things which"|FALSE
626|"are most righteously done, should be perverted by the slanders of"|FALSE
626|"malicious men, and that one should bear the reproach of sin where he"|FALSE
626|"has rather deserved the hope of honour.  Many things are done with"|FALSE
626|"singleness of eye, the right hand knoweth not what the left hand doth,"|FALSE
626|"the lump is uncorrupted by leaven, nor is the garment woven of wool and"|FALSE
626|"linen; and yet by the trickery of perverse men a pious work is"|FALSE
626|"mendaciously transformed into some monstrous act.  Certes, such is the"|FALSE
626|"unhappy condition of sinful nature, that not merely in acts that are"|FALSE
626|"morally doubtful it adopts the worse conclusion; but often it depraves"|FALSE
626|"by iniquitous subversion those which have the appearance of rectitude."|FALSE
626|"For although the love of books from the nature of its object bears the"|FALSE
626|"aspect of goodness, yet, wonderful to say, it has rendered us obnoxious"|FALSE
626|"to the censures of many, by whose astonishment we were disparaged and"|FALSE
626|"censured, now for excess of curiosity, now for the exhibition of"|FALSE
626|"vanity, now for intemperance of delight in literature; though indeed we"|FALSE
626|"were no more disturbed by their vituperation than by the barking of so"|FALSE
626|"many dogs, satisfied with the testimony of Him to whom it appertaineth"|FALSE
626|"to try the hearts and reins.  For as the aim and purpose of our inmost"|FALSE
626|"will is inscrutable to men and is seen of God alone, the searcher of"|FALSE
626|"hearts, they deserve to be rebuked for their pernicious temerity, who"|FALSE
626|"so eagerly set a mark of condemnation upon human acts, the ultimate"|FALSE
626|"springs of which they cannot see.  For the final end in matters of"|FALSE
626|"conduct holds the same position as first principles in speculative"|FALSE
626|"science or axioms in mathematics, as the chief of philosophers,"|FALSE
626|"Aristotle, points out in the seventh book of the Ethics.  And"|FALSE
626|"therefore, just as the truth of our conclusions depends upon the"|FALSE
626|"correctness of our premises, so in matters of action the stamp of moral"|FALSE
626|"rectitude is given by the honesty of aim and purpose, in cases where"|FALSE
626|"the act itself would otherwise be held to be morally indifferent."|FALSE
626|"Now we have long cherished in our heart of hearts the fixed resolve,"|FALSE
626|"when Providence should grant a favourable opportunity, to found in"|FALSE
626|"perpetual charity a Hall in the reverend university of Oxford, the"|FALSE
626|"chief nursing mother of all liberal arts, and to endow it with the"|FALSE
626|"necessary revenues, for the maintenance of a number of scholars; and"|FALSE
626|"moreover to enrich the Hall with the treasures of our books, that all"|FALSE
626|"and every of them should be in common as regards their use and study,"|FALSE
626|"not only to the scholars of the said Hall, but by their means to all"|FALSE
626|"the students of the before-named university for ever, in the form and"|FALSE
626|"manner which the following chapter shall declare.  Wherefore the"|FALSE
626|"sincere love of study and zeal for the strengthening of the orthodox"|FALSE
626|"faith to the edifying of the Church, have begotten in us that"|FALSE
626|"solicitude so marvellous to the lovers of pelf, of collecting books"|FALSE
626|"wherever they were to be purchased, regardless of expense, and of"|FALSE
626|"having those that could not he bought fairly transcribed."|FALSE
626|"For as the favourite occupations of men are variously distinguished"|FALSE
626|"according to the disposition of the heavenly bodies, which frequently"|FALSE
626|"control our natural composition, so that some men choose to devote"|FALSE
626|"themselves to architecture, others to agriculture, others to hunting,"|FALSE
626|"others to navigation, others to war, others to games, we have under the"|FALSE
626|"aspect of Mercury entertained a blameless pleasure in books, which"|FALSE
626|"under the rule of right reason, over which no stars are dominant, we"|FALSE
626|"have ordered to the glory of the Supreme Being, that where our minds"|FALSE
626|"found tranquillity and peace, thence also might spring a most devout"|FALSE
626|"service of God.  And therefore let our detractors cease, who are as"|FALSE
626|"blind men judging of colours; let not bats venture to speak of light;"|FALSE
626|"and let not those who carry beams in their own eyes presume to pull the"|FALSE
626|"mote out of their brother's eye. Let them cease to jeer with satirical"|FALSE
626|"taunts at things of which they are ignorant, and to discuss hidden"|FALSE
626|"things that are not revealed to the eyes of men; who perchance would"|FALSE
626|"have praised and commended us, if we had spent our time in hunting,"|FALSE
626|"dice-playing, or courting the smiles of ladies."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XIX"|FALSE
626|"OF THE MANNER OF LENDING ALL OUR BOOKS TO STUDENTS"|FALSE
626|"It has ever been difficult so to restrain men by the laws of rectitude,"|FALSE
626|"that the astuteness of successors might not strive to transgress the"|FALSE
626|"bounds of their predecessors, and to infringe established rules in"|FALSE
626|"insolence of licence.  Accordingly, with the advice of prudent men, we"|FALSE
626|"have prescribed the manner in which we desire that the communication"|FALSE
626|"and use of our books should be permitted for the benefit of students."|FALSE
626|"Imprimis, we give and grant all and singular the books, of which we"|FALSE
626|"have made a special catalogue, in consideration of affection, to the"|FALSE
626|"community of scholars living in ---- Hall at Oxford, as a perpetual"|FALSE
626|"gift, for our soul and the souls of our parents, and also for the soul"|FALSE
626|"of the most illustrious King Edward the Third from the Conquest, and of"|FALSE
626|"the most pious Queen Philippa, his consort: to the intent that the same"|FALSE
626|"books may be lent from time to time to all and singular the scholars"|FALSE
626|"and masters of the said place, as well regular as secular, for the"|FALSE
626|"advancement and use of study, in the manner immediately following, that"|FALSE
626|"is to say:"|FALSE
626|"Five of the scholars sojourning in the Hall aforesaid shall be"|FALSE
626|"appointed by the Master thereof, who shall have the charge of all the"|FALSE
626|"books, of which five persons three and not fewer may lend any book or"|FALSE
626|"books for inspection and study; but for copying or transcribing we"|FALSE
626|"direct that no book shall be allowed outside the walls of the house."|FALSE
626|"Therefore, when any scholar secular or religious, whom for this purpose"|FALSE
626|"we regard with equal favour, shall seek to borrow any book, let the"|FALSE
626|"keepers diligently consider if they have a duplicate of the said book,"|FALSE
626|"and if so, let them lend him the book, taking such pledge as in their"|FALSE
626|"judgment exceeds the value of the book delivered, and let a record be"|FALSE
626|"made forthwith of the pledge and of the book lent, containing the names"|FALSE
626|"of the persons delivering the book and of the person who receives it,"|FALSE
626|"together with the day and year when the loan is made."|FALSE
626|"But if the keepers find that the book asked for is not in duplicate,"|FALSE
626|"they shall not lend such book to any one whomsoever, unless he shall"|FALSE
626|"belong to the community of scholars of the said Hall, unless perhaps"|FALSE
626|"for inspection within the walls of the aforesaid house or Hall, but not"|FALSE
626|"to be carried beyond it."|FALSE
626|"But to any of the scholars of the said Hall, any book may be lent by"|FALSE
626|"three of the aforesaid keepers, after first recording, however, his"|FALSE
626|"name, with the day on which he receives the book.  Nevertheless, the"|FALSE
626|"borrower may not lend the book entrusted to him to another, except with"|FALSE
626|"the permission of three of the aforesaid keepers, and then the name of"|FALSE
626|"the first borrower being erased, the name of the second with the time"|FALSE
626|"of delivery is to be recorded."|FALSE
626|"Each keeper shall take an oath to observe all these regulations when"|FALSE
626|"they enter upon the charge of the books.  And the recipients of any"|FALSE
626|"book or books shall thereupon swear that they will not use the book or"|FALSE
626|"books for any other purpose but that of inspection or study, and that"|FALSE
626|"they will not take or permit to be taken it or them beyond the town and"|FALSE
626|"suburbs of Oxford."|FALSE
626|"Moreover, every year the aforesaid keepers shall render an account to"|FALSE
626|"the Master of the House and two of his scholars whom he shall associate"|FALSE
626|"with himself, or if he shall not be at leisure, he shall appoint three"|FALSE
626|"inspectors, other than the keepers, who shall peruse the catalogue of"|FALSE
626|"books, and see that they have them all, either in the volumes"|FALSE
626|"themselves or at least as represented by deposits.  And the more"|FALSE
626|"fitting season for rendering this account we believe to be from the"|FALSE
626|"First of July until the festival of the Translation of the Glorious"|FALSE
626|"Martyr S.  Thomas next following."|FALSE
626|"We add this further provision, that anyone to whom a book has been"|FALSE
626|"lent, shall once a year exhibit it to the keepers, and shall, if he"|FALSE
626|"wishes it, see his pledge.  Moreover, if it chances that a book is lost"|FALSE
626|"by death, theft, fraud, or carelessness, he who has lost it or his"|FALSE
626|"representative or executor shall pay the value of the book and receive"|FALSE
626|"back his deposit.  But if in any wise any profit shall accrue to the"|FALSE
626|"keepers, it shall not be applied to any purpose but the repair and"|FALSE
626|"maintenance of the books."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XX"|FALSE
626|"AN EXHORTATION TO SCHOLARS TO REQUITE US BY PIOUS PRAYERS"|FALSE
626|"Time now clamours for us to terminate this treatise which we have"|FALSE
626|"composed concerning the love of books; in which we have endeavoured to"|FALSE
626|"give the astonishment of our contemporaries the reason why we have"|FALSE
626|"loved books so greatly.  But because it is hardly granted to mortals to"|FALSE
626|"accomplish aught that is not rolled in the dust of vanity, we do not"|FALSE
626|"venture entirely to justify the zealous love which we have so long had"|FALSE
626|"for books, or to deny that it may perchance sometimes have been the"|FALSE
626|"occasion of some venial negligence, albeit the object of our love is"|FALSE
626|"honourable and our intention upright.  For if when we have done"|FALSE
626|"everything, we are bound to call ourselves unprofitable servants; if"|FALSE
626|"the most holy Job was afraid of all his works; if according to Isaiah"|FALSE
626|"all our righteousness is as filthy rags, who shall presume to boast"|FALSE
626|"himself of the perfection of any virtue, or deny that from some"|FALSE
626|"circumstance a thing may deserve to be reprehended, which in itself"|FALSE
626|"perhaps was not reprehensible.  For good springs from one selfsame"|FALSE
626|"source, but evil arises in many ways, as Dionysius informs us."|FALSE
