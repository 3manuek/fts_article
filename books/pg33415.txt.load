33415|"GESCHWITZ. She is more glorious to look at than I have ever seen her!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. God preserve me from founding my life-happiness on yourtaste and judgment! If the sickness has hit her as it has you, I'msmashed and thru! You're leaving the contagious ward like anacrobat-lady who's had an accident after giving herself up to art.You can scarcely blow your nose any more. First you need aquarter-hour to sort your fingers, and then you have to be mightycareful not to break off the tip."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. What puts *us* under the ground gives *her* health andstrength again."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. That's all right and fine enough. But I don't think I'll betravelling off with her this evening."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. You will let your bride journey all alone, after all?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. In the first place, the old fellow's going with her toprotect her in case anything serious--. My escort could only besuspicious. And secondly, I must wait here till my costumes areready. I'll get across the frontier soon enough alright,--and I hopein the meantime she'll put on a little embonpoint, too. Then we'llget married, provided I can present her before a respectable public.I love the practical in a woman: what theories they make up forthemselves are all the same to me. Aren't they to you too, doctor?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. I haven't heard what you were saying."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I'd never have got my person mixed up in this plot if shehadn't kept tickling my bare pate, before her sentence. If only shedoesn't start doing too much as soon as she's out of Germany! I'dlike best to take her to London for six months, and let her fill upon plum-cakes. In London one expands just from the sea air. And then,too, in London one doesn't feel with every swallow of beer as if thehand of fate were at one's throat."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. I've been asking myself for a week whether a person who'd beensentenced to prison could still be made to go as the chief figure ina modern drama."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. If the man would only come, now!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I've still got to redeem my properties out of the pawn-shophere, too. Six hundred kilos of the best iron. The baggage-rate on'em is always three times as much as my own ticket, so that the wholejunket isn't worth a trowser's button. When I went into the pawn-shopwith 'em, dripping with sweat, they asked me if the things weregenuine!--I'd have really done better to have had the costumes madeabroad. In Paris, for instance, they see at the first glance whereone's best points are, and bravely lay them bare. But you can't learnthat with bow-legs; it's got to be studied on classically shapedpeople. In this country they're as scared of naked skin as they areabroad of dynamite bombs. A couple of years ago I was fined fiftymarks at the Alhambra Theater, because people could see I had a fewhairs on my chest, not enough to make a respectable tooth-brush! Butthe Fine Arts Minister opined that the little school-girls might losetheir joy in knitting stockings because of it; and since then I havemyself shaved once a month."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. If I didn't need every bit of my creative power now for the\"World-conqueror,\" I might like to test the problem and see whatcould be done with it. That's the curse of our young literature:we're so much too literary. We know only such questions and problemsas come up among writers and cultured people. We cannot see beyondthe limits of our own professional interests. In order to get back onthe trail of a great and powerful art we must move as much aspossible among men who've never read a book in their lives, whom thesimplest animal instincts direct in all they do. I've tried already,with all my might, to work according to those principles--in my\"Earth-spirit.\" The woman who was my model for the chief figure inthat, breathes to-day--and has for a year--behind barred windows; andon that account for some incomprehensible reason the play was onlybrought to performance by the Society for Free Literature. As long asmy father was alive, all the stages of Germany stood open to mycreations. That has been vastly changed."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I've had a pair of tights made of the tenderest blue-green.If *they* don't make a success abroad, I'll sell mouse-traps! Thetrunks are so delicate I can't sit on the edge of a table in 'em. Theonly thing that will disturb the good impression is my awful baldhead, which I owe to my active participation in this greatconspiracy. To lie in the hospital in perfect health for three monthswould make a fat pig of the most run-down old hobo. Since coming outI've fed on nothing but Karlsbad pills. Day and night I haveorchestra rehearsals in my intestines. I'll be so washed out before Iget across the frontier that I won't be able to lift a bottle-cork."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. How the attendants in the hospital got out of her wayyesterday! That was a refreshing sight. The garden was still as thegrave: in the loveliest noon sunlight the convalescents didn'tventure out of doors. Away back by the contagious ward she steppedout under the mulberry trees and swayed on her ankles on the gravel.The door-keeper had recognized me, and a young doctor who met me inthe corridor shrunk up as tho a revolver shot had struck him. TheSisters vanished into the big rooms or stayed stuck against thewalls. When I came back there was not a soul to be seen in the gardenor at the gate. No better chance could have been found, if we had hadthe curséd passports. And now the fellow says he isn't going withher!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I understand the poor hospital-brothers. One has a bad footand another has a swollen cheek, and there appears in the midst ofthem the incarnate death-insurance-agentess! In the Hall of theKnights, as the blessed division was called from which I organized myspying, when the news got around there that Sister Theophila haddeparted this life, not one of the fellows could be kept in bed. Theyscrambled up to the window-bars, if they had to drag their painsalong with them by the hundred-weight. I never heard such swearing inmy life!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Allow me, Fräulein von Geschwitz, to come back to myproposition once more. Tho my father was shot in this room, still Ican see in the murder, as in the punishment, nothing but a horriblemisfortune that has befallen *her*; nor do I think that my father, ifhe had come through alive, would have withdrawn his support from herentirely. Whether your plan for freeing her will succeed still seemsto me very doubtful, tho I wouldn't like to discourage you; but I canfind no words to express the admiration with which yourself-sacrifice, your energy, your superhuman scorn of death, inspiresme. I don't believe any man ever risked so much for a woman, letalone for a friend. I am not aware, Fräulein von Geschwitz, how richyou are, but the expenses for what you have accomplished must haveexhausted your fortune. May I venture to offer you a loan of 20,000marks--which I should have no trouble raising for you in cash?"|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. How we did rejoice when Sister Theophila was really dead!From that day on we were free from custody. We changed our beds as weliked. I had done my hair like hers, and copied every tone of hervoice. When the professor came he called *her* \"gnädiges Fräulein\"and said to me, \"It's better living here than in prison!\"... When theSister suddenly was missing, we looked at each other in suspense: wehad both been sick five days: now was the deciding moment. Nextmorning came the assistant.--\"How is Sister Theophila?\"--\"Dead!\"--Wecommunicated behind his back, and when he had gone we sank in eachother's arms: \"God be thanked! God be thanked!\"--What pains it costme to keep my darling from betraying how well she already was! \"Youhave nine years of prison before you,\" I cried to her early and late.Now they probably won't let her stay in the contagious ward threedays more!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I lay in the hospital full three months to spy out theground, after toilfully peddling together the qualities necessary forsuch a long stay. Now I act the valet here with you, Dr. Schön, sothat no strange servants may come into the house. Where is thebridegroom who's ever done so much for his bride? *My* fortune hasalso been destroyed."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. When you succeed in developing her into a respectable artisteyou will have put the world in debt to you. With the temperament andthe beauty that she has to give out of the depths of her nature shecan make the most blasé public hold its breath. And then, too, shewill be protected by *acting* passion from a second time becoming acriminal in reality."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I'll soon drive her kiddishness out of her!"|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. There he comes! (_Steps louden in the gallery. Then thecurtains part at the head of the stairs and Schigolch in a long blackcoat with a white sun-shade in his right hand comes down. Thruout theplay his speech is interrupted with frequent yawns._)"|FALSE

33415|"SCHIGOLCH. Since nine o'clock this morning I've been round to all theold-clothes-men. Three brand new trunks stuffed full of old trowsersI've expressed to Buenos Ayres via Bremerhaven. My legs are danglingon me like the tongue of a bell. That's the new life it's going to befrom now on!"|FALSE

33415|"RODRIGO. Do you want me to start my new engagement in bath-robe andslippers?"|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. Hm--Sister Theophila wouldn't have gone to heaven sopromptly either, if she hadn't felt so affectionate towards ourpatient."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO.. She'll have a different value when one must serve thru ahoneymoon with her. Anyway, it can't hurt her if she gets a littlefresh air beforehand."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. (_A pocketbook in his hand, to Geschwitz who is leaning on achair-back by the centre table._) This holds 10,000 marks."|FALSE

33415|"ALVA. You're bringing her here?"|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. I'm bringing her here. Or do you fear for your health?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. You see that I fear nothing."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. According to the latest wire, the doctor is on his way toConstantinople to have his \"Earth-spirit\" produced before the Sultanby harem-ladies and eunuchs."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. (_Opening the centre door under the gallery._) It's shorter foryou thru here. (_Exeunt Schigolch and Countess Geschwitz. Alva locksthe door._)"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. You were going to give more money to the crazy sky-rocket!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. What has that to do with you?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I get paid like a lamp-lighter, tho I had to demoralize allthe Sisters in the hospital. Then came the assistants' and thedoctors' turn, and then--"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Will you seriously inform me that the medical professors letthemselves be influenced by you?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. With the money those gentlemen cost me I could becomePresident of the United States!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. But Fräulein von Geschwitz has reimbursed you for every pennythat you spent. So far as I know you're getting a monthly salary offive hundred marks from her besides. It is often pretty hard tobelieve in your love for the unhappy murderess. When I asked Fräuleinvon Geschwitz just now to accept my help, it certainly was not toincite your insatiable avarice. The admiration which I have learnt tohave for Fräulein von Geschwitz in this affair, I am far from feelingtowards you. It is not at all clear to me what claims of any kind youcan make upon me. That you chanced to be present at the murder of myfather has not yet created the slightest bond of relationship betweenyou and me. On the contrary, I am firmly convinced that if the heroicundertaking of Countess Geschwitz had not come your way you would belying somewhere to-day without a penny, drunken in the gutter."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. And do you know what would have become of you if you hadn'tsold for two millions the tuppeny paper your father ran? You'd havehitched up with the stringiest sort of ballet-girl and been to-day astable-boy in the Humpelmeier Circus. What work do you do? You'vewritten a drama of horrors in which my bride's calves are the twochief figures and which no high-class theater will produce. Youwalking pajamas! You fresh rag-bag you! Two years ago I balanced twosaddled cavalry-horses on this chest. How that'll go now, after this(_clasping his bald head_), is a question sure enough. The foreigngirls will get a fine idea of German art when they see the sweat comebeading thru my tights at every fresh kilo-weight! I shall make thewhole auditorium stink with my exhalations!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. You're weak as a dish-clout!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Would to God you were right! or did you perhaps intend toinsult me? If so, I'll set the tip of my toe to your jaw so that yourtongue'll crawl along the carpet over there!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Try it! (_Steps and voices outside._) Who is that...?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. You can thank God that I have no public here before me!"|FALSE

33415|"RODRIGO. Oh the devil, unlock it!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Hide yourself!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I'll get behind the portières. I've stood there once before,a year ago. (_Disappears, right. Alva opens the rear door, whereuponAlfred Hugenberg enters, hat in hand._)"|FALSE

33415|"ALVA. My eyes are bad. I am forced to keep the blinds closed."|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I need your help. You will not refuse me. I've got a planready. Can anyone hear us?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. What do you mean? What sort of a plan?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Are you alone?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Yes. What do you want to impart to me?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I've had two plans already that I let drop. What I shalltell you now has been worked out to the last possible chance. If Ihad money I should not confide it to you; I thought about that a longtime before coming.... Will you not permit me to set forth to you mydesign?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Will you kindly tell me just what you are talking about?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. She cannot possibly be so indifferent to you that I musttell you that. The evidence *you* gave the coroner helped her morethan everything the defending counsel said."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. I beg to decline the supposition."|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. You would say that; I understand that, of course. But allthe same you were her best witness."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. *You* were! You said my father was about to force her to shootherself."|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. He was, too. But they didn't believe me. I wasn't put onmy oath."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Where have you come from now?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. From a reform-school I broke out of this morning."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. And what do you have in view?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I'm trying to get into the confidence of a turnkey."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. What do you mean to live on?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I'm living with a girl who's had a child by my father."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Who is your father?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. He's a police captain. I know the prison without everhaving been inside it; and nobody in it will recognize me as I amnow. But I don't count on that at all. I know an iron ladder by whichone can get from the first court to the roof and thru an openingthere into the attic. There's no way up to it from inside. But in allfive wings boards and laths and great heaps of shavings are lyingunder the roofs, and I'll drag them all together in the middle andset fire to them. My pockets are full of matches and all the thingsused to make fires."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. But then you'll burn up there!"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Of course, if I'm not rescued. But to get into the firstcourt I must have the turnkey in my power, and for that I need money.Not that I mean to bribe him; that wouldn't go. I must lend him moneyto send his three children to the country, and then at four o'clockin the morning when the prisoners of respected families aredischarged, I'll slip in the door. He'll lock-up behind me and ask mewhat I'm after, and I'll ask him to let me out again in the evening.And before it gets light, I'm up in the attic."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. How did you escape from the reform-school?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Jumped out the window. I need two hundred marks for therascal to send his family to the country."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. (_Stepping out of the portières, right._) Will the HerrBaron have coffee in the music-room or on the veranda?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Where does that man come from? Out of the same door! Hejumped out of the same door!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. I've taken him into my service. He is dependable."|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. (_Grasping his temples._) Fool that I am! Oh, fool!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Oh, yah, we've seen each other here before! Cut away now toyour vice-mamma. Your kid brother might like to uncle his brothersand sisters. Make your sir-papa the grandfather of his children!You're the only thing we've missed. If you once get into my sight inthe next two weeks, I'll beat your bean up for porridge."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Be quiet, you!"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I'm a fool!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. What do you want to do with your fire? Don't you know thelady's been dead three weeks?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Did they cut off her head?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. No, she's got that still. She was mashed by the cholera."|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. That is not true!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. What do you know about it! There, read it: here! (_Takingout a paper and pointing to the place._) \"The murderess of Dr.Schön....\" (_Gives Hugenberg the paper. He reads:_)"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. \"The murderess of Dr. Schön has in some incomprehensibleway fallen ill of the cholera in prison.\" It doesn't say that she'sdead."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Well, what else do you suppose she is? She's been lying inthe churchyard three weeks. Back in the left-hand corner behind therubbish-heap where the little crosses are with no names on them,there she lies under the first one. You'll know the spot because thegrass hasn't grown on it. Hang a tin wreath there, and then get backto your nursery-school or I'll denounce you to the police. I know thefemale that beguiles her leisure hours with you!"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. (_To Alva._) Is it true that she's dead?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Thank God, yes!--Please, do not keep me here any longer. Mydoctor has forbidden me to receive visitors."|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. My future is worth so little now! I would gladly havegiven the last scrap of what life is worth to me for her happiness.Heigh-ho! One way or another I'll sure go to the devil now!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. If you dare in any way to approach me or the doctor here ormy honorable friend Schigolch too near, I'll inform on you forintended arson. You need three good years, to learn where not tostick your fingers in! Now get out!"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Fool!"|FALSE

33415|"RODRIGO. I've had enough of this Geschwitz's company! If my bride isto become a corporation with limited liability, somebody else can goin ahead of me. I propose to make a magnificent trapeze-artist out ofher, and willingly risk my life to do it. But then I'll be master ofthe house, and will myself indicate what cavaliers she is to receive!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. The boy has what our age lacks: a hero-nature; therefore, ofcourse, he is going to ruin.

33415|"RODRIGO. If I could only have given him one in the jaw for that rightaway! Thank God, there are jails where scum like that gets somerespect for the law pounded into them."|FALSE

She is now in hertwentieth year, has been married three times and has satisfied agigantic horde of lovers, and her heart's desires are at last prettyplain. But the man's got to have the seven deadly sins on hisforehead, or she honors him not. If he looks as if a dog-catcher hadspat him out on the street, then, with such women-folks, he needn'tbe afraid of a prince! I'll rent a garage fifty feet high and breakher in there; and when she's learnt the first diving-leap withoutbreaking her neck I'll pull on a black coat and not stir a finger therest of my life.

At the first opportunity that offered she put onthe underclothes in which a sick woman had just died and which reallyought to have been burnt.

The little darling inher childhood's dreams imagined the life even more intoxicating thanit is, and complained of it to Mama. On that, they nabbed me; but byreliable demeanor I soon enough won the confidence of the criminalpolice and they sent me here on a hundred and fifty marks a month,because they were tripling our contingent here on account of theseeverlasting bomb-explosions. But who can get along on a hundred andfifty marks a month? My colleagues get women to support them; but, ofcourse, I found it more convenient to take up my former callingagain; and of the numberless adventuresses of the best families ofthe entire world, whom chance brings together here, I have alreadyforwarded many a young creature hungry for life to the place of hernatural vocation."|FALSE

Against that, the House ofOikonomopulos in Cairo bids sixty pounds for you--twelve hundredmarks--two hundred more than the Attorney General.

I bought arevolver, and ran one night bare-foot thru the deep snow over thebridge to the park to shoot myself there. But then by good luck I laythree months in the hospital without setting eyes on a man, and inthat time my eyes opened and I got to know myself. Night after nightin my dreams I saw the man for whom I was created and who was createdfor me, and then when I was let out on the men again I was no longera silly goose. Since then I can see on a man, in a pitch-dark nightand a hundred feet away, whether we're suited to each other; and if Isin against that insight I feel the next day dirtied, body and soul,and need weeks to get over the loathing I have for myself. And nowyou imagine I'll give myself to every and any Tom and Harry!"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. Toms and Harries don't patronize Oikonomopulos of Cairo.His custom consists of Scottish lords, Russian dignitaries, Indiangovernors, and our jolly Rhineland captains of industry. I must onlyguarantee that you speak French. With your gift for languages you'llquickly enough learn as much English, besides, as you'll need to geton with. And you'll reside in a royally furnished apartment with anoutlook on the minarets of the El Azhar Mosque, and walk around allday on Persian carpets as thick as your fist, and dress every eveningin a fabulous Paris gown and drink as much champagne as yourcustomers can pay for, and, finally, you'll even remain, up to acertain point, your own mistress. If the man doesn't please you, youneedn't bring him any reciprocal feelings.

33415|"LULU. Those pictures that I gave you, you've sent to him?"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. You see he can value them better than I. The picture inwhich you stand before the mirror as Eve he'll probably hang up atthe house-door, after you've got there.... And then there's one thingmore for you to notice: with Oikonomopulos in Cairo you'll be saferfrom your blood-hounds than if you crept into a Canadian wilderness.It isn't so easy to transport an Egyptian courtesan to a Germanprison,--first, on account of the mere expense, and second, from fearof coming too close to eternal Justice."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. (_Proudly, in a clear voice._) What's your eternal Justice todo with me! You can see as plain as your five fingers I shan't letmyself be locked up in any such amusement-place!"|FALSE

33415|"LULU. We still have thirty thousand marks."|FALSE

It's a wonder which I, as one of the secret police, cannotunderstand, that you two have been able to live for a full yearunmolested. But just as I came on the track of your antecedents, soany day, with your mighty consumption of men, one of my colleaguesmay make the happy discovery.
