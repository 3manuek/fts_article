39064|"PREFACE."|FALSE
39064|"I here offer a translation of the third or last part of Hegel’sencyclopaedic sketch of philosophy,—the _Philosophy of Mind_. The volume,like its subject, stands complete in itself. But it may also be regardedas a supplement or continuation of the work begun in my version of his_Logic_. I have not ventured upon the _Philosophy of Nature_ which liesbetween these two. That is a province, to penetrate into which wouldrequire an equipment of learning I make no claim to,—a province, also, ofwhich the present-day interest would be largely historical, or at leastbound up with historical circumstances."|FALSE
39064|"The translation is made from the German text given in the Second Part ofthe Seventh Volume of Hegel’s Collected Works, occasionally corrected bycomparison with that found in the second and third editions (of 1827 and1830) published by the author. I have reproduced only Hegel’s ownparagraphs, and entirely omitted the _Zusätze_ of the editors. Theseaddenda—which are in origin lecture-notes—to the paragraphs are, in thetext of the Collected Works, given for the first section only. Thepsychological part which they accompany has been barely treated elsewhereby Hegel: but a good popular exposition of it will be found in Erdmann’s_Psychologische Briefe_. The second section was dealt with at greaterlength by Hegel himself in his _Philosophy of Law_ (1820). The topics ofthe third section are largely covered by his lectures on Art, Religion,and History of Philosophy."|FALSE
39064|"I do not conceal from myself that the text offers a hard nut to crack. Yethere and there, even through the medium of the translation, I think somelight cannot fail to come to an earnest student. Occasionally, too, as,for instance, in §§ 406, 459, 549, and still more in §§ 552, 573, at theclose of which might stand the words _Liberavi animam meam_, the writerreally “lets himself go,” and gives his mind freely on questions wherespeculation comes closely in touch with life."|FALSE
39064|"In the _Five Introductory Essays_ I have tried sometimes to put together,and sometimes to provide with collateral elucidation, some points in theMental Philosophy. I shall not attempt to justify the selection ofsubjects for special treatment further than to hope that they form a moreor less connected group, and to refer for a study of some generalquestions of system and method to my _Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel’sPhilosophy_ which appear almost simultaneously with this volume."|FALSE

39064|"The art of finding titles, and of striking out headings which catch theeye or ear, and lead the mind by easy paths of association to the subjectunder exposition, was not one of Hegel’s gifts. A stirring phrase, a vividor picturesque turn of words, he often has. But his lists of contents,when they cease to be commonplace, are apt to run into the bizarre and thegrotesque. Generally, indeed, his rubrics are the old and (as we may betempted to call them) insignificant terms of the text-books. But, inHegel’s use of them, these conventional designations are charged with ahighly individualised meaning. They may mean more—they may mean less—thanthey habitually pass for: but they unquestionably specify their meaningwith a unique and almost personal flavour. And this can hardly fail tocreate and to disappoint undue expectations."|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Philosophy and its Parts."|FALSE
39064|"Even the main divisions of his system show this conservatism interminology. The names of the three parts of the Encyclopaedia are, we maysay, non-significant of their peculiar contents. And that for a goodreason. What Hegel proposes to give is no novel or special doctrine, butthe universal philosophy which has passed on from age to age, herenarrowed and there widened, but still essentially the same. It isconscious of its continuity and proud of its identity with the teachingsof Plato and Aristotle."|FALSE
39064|"The earliest attempts of the Greek philosophers to present philosophy in acomplete and articulated order—attempts generally attributed to theStoics, the schoolmen of antiquity—made it a tripartite whole. These threeparts were Logic, Physics, and Ethics. In their entirety they were meantto form a cycle of unified knowledge, satisfying the needs of theory aswell as practice. As time went on, however, the situation changed: and ifthe old names remained, their scope and value suffered many changes. Newinterests and curiosities, due to altered circumstances, brought otherdepartments of reality under the focus of investigation besides thosewhich had been primarily discussed under the old names. Inquiries becamemore specialised, and each tended to segregate itself from the rest as anindependent field of science. The result was that in modern times theterritory still marked by the ancient titles had shrunk to a mere phantomof its former bulk. Almost indeed things had come to such a pass that thetime-honoured figures had sunk into the misery of _rois fainéants_; whilethe real business of knowledge was discharged by the younger and lessconventional lines of research which the needs and fashions of the timehad called up. Thus Logic, in the narrow formal sense, was turned into an“art” of argumentation and a system of technical rules for the analysisand synthesis of academical discussion. Physics or Natural Philosophyrestricted itself to the elaboration of some metaphysical postulates orhypotheses regarding the general modes of physical operation. And Ethicscame to be a very unpractical discussion of subtleties regarding moralfaculty and moral standard. Meanwhile a theory of scientific method and ofthe laws governing the growth of intelligence and formation of ideas grewup, and left the older logic to perish of formality and inanition. Thesuccessive departments of physical science, each in turn asserting itsindependence, finally left Natural Philosophy no alternative betweenclinging to its outworn hypotheses and abstract generalities, oridentifying itself (as Newton in his great book put it) with the_Principia Mathematica_ of the physical sciences. Ethics, in its turn, sawitself, on one hand, replaced by psychological inquiries into therelations between the feelings and the will and the intelligence; while,on the other hand, a host of social, historical, economical, and otherresearches cut it off from the real facts of human life, and left it nomore than the endless debates on the logical and metaphysical issuesinvolved in free-will and conscience, duty and merit."|FALSE
39064|"It has sometimes been said that Kant settled this controversy between theold departments of philosophy and the new branches of science. And thesettlement, it is implied, consisted in assigning to the philosopher asort of police and patrol duty in the commonwealth of science. He was tosee that boundaries were duly respected, and that each science keptstrictly to its own business. For this purpose each branch of philosophywas bound to convert itself into a department of criticism—an examinationof first principles in the several provinces of reality or experience—witha view to get a distinct conception of what they were, and thus defineexactly the lines on which the structures of more detailed science couldbe put up solidly and safely. This plan offered tempting lines toresearch, and sounded well. But on further reflection there emerge one ortwo difficulties, hard to get over. Paradoxical though it may seem, onecannot rightly estimate the capacity and range of foundations, before onehas had some familiarity with the buildings erected upon them. Thus youare involved in a circle: a circle which is probably inevitable, but whichfor that reason it is well to recognise at once. Then—what is only anotherway of saying the same thing—it is impossible to draw an inflexible linebetween premises of principle and conclusions of detail. There is no spotat which criticism can stop, and, having done its business well, hand onthe remaining task to dogmatic system. It was an instinctive feeling ofthis implication of system in what professed only to be criticism whichled the aged Kant to ignore his own previous professions that he offeredas yet no system, and when Fichte maintained himself to be erecting thefabric for which Kant had prepared the ground, to reply by thecounter-declaration that the criticism was the system—that “the curtainwas the picture.”"|FALSE
39064|"The Hegelian philosophy is an attempt to combine criticism with system,and thus realise what Kant had at least foretold. It is a system which isself-critical, and systematic only through the absoluteness of itscriticism. In Hegel’s own phrase, it is an immanent and an incessantdialectic, which from first to last allows finality to no dogmatic rest,but carries out Kant’s description of an Age of Criticism, in whichnothing, however majestic and sacred its authority, can plead forexception from the all-testing _Elenchus_. Then, on the other hand, Hegelrefuses to restrict philosophy and its branches to anything short of thetotality. He takes in its full sense that often-used phrase—the Unity ofKnowledge. Logic becomes the all-embracing research of “firstprinciples,”—the principles which regulate physics and ethics. The olddivisions between logic and metaphysic, between induction and deduction,between theory of reasoning and theory of knowledge,—divisions which thosewho most employed them were never able to show the reason and purposeof—because indeed they had grown up at various times and by “naturalselection” through a vast mass of incidents: these are superseded andmerged in one continuous theory of real knowledge considered under itsabstract or formal aspect,—of organised and known reality in itsunderlying thought-system. But these first principles were only anabstraction from complete reality—the reality which nature has whenunified by mind—and they presuppose the total from which they are derived.The realm of pure thought is only the ghost of the Idea—of the unity andreality of knowledge, and it must be reindued with its flesh and blood.The logical world is (in Kantian phrase) only the _possibility_ of Natureand Mind. It comes first—because it is a system of First Principles: butthese first principles could only be elicited by a philosophy which hasrealised the meaning of a mental experience, gathered by interpreting thefacts of Nature."|FALSE
39064|"Natural Philosophy is no longer—according to Hegel’s view of it—merely ascheme of mathematical ground-work. That may be its first step. But itsscope is a complete unity (which is not a mere aggregate) of the branchesof natural knowledge, exploring both the inorganic and the organic world.In dealing with this endless problem, philosophy seems to be baulked by animpregnable obstacle to its progress. Every day the advance ofspecialisation renders any comprehensive or synoptic view of the totalityof science more and more impossible. No doubt we talk readily enough ofScience. But here, if anywhere, we may say there is no Science, but onlysciences. The generality of science is a proud fiction or a gorgeousdream, variously told and interpreted according to the varying interestand proclivity of the scientist. The sciences, or those who speciallyexpound them, know of no unity, no philosophy of science. They are contentto remark that in these days the thing is impossible, and to pick out thefaults in any attempts in that direction that are made outside their pale.Unfortunately for this contention, the thing is done by us all, and,indeed, has to be done. If not as men of science, yet as men—as humanbeings—we have to put together things and form some total estimate of thedrift of development, of the unity of nature. To get a notion, not merelyof the general methods and principles of the sciences, but of theirresults and teachings, and to get this not as a mere lot of fragments, butwith a systematic unity, is indispensable in some degree for all rationallife. The life not founded on science is not the life of man. But he willnot find what he wants in the text-books of the specialist, who is obligedto treat his subject, as Plato says, “under the pressure of necessity,”and who dare not look on it in its quality “to draw the soul towardstruth, and to form the philosophic intellect so as to uplift what we nowunduly keep down(1).” If the philosopher in this province does his workbut badly, he may plead the novelty of the task to which he comes as apioneer or even an architect. He finds little that he can directlyutilise. The materials have been gathered and prepared for very specialaims; and the great aim of science—that human life may be made a higher,an ampler, and happier thing,—has hardly been kept in view at all, exceptin its more materialistic aspects. To the philosopher the supreme interestof the physical sciences is that man also belongs to the physicaluniverse, or that Mind and Matter as we know them are (in Mr. Spencer’slanguage) “at once antithetical and inseparable.” He wants to find theplace of Man,—but of Man as Mind—in Nature."|FALSE
39064|"If the scope of Natural Philosophy be thus expanded to make it the unityand more than the synthetic aggregate of the several physical sciences—tomake it the whole which surpasses the addition of all their fragments, thepurpose of Ethics has not less to be deepened and widened. Ethics, underthat title, Hegel knows not. And for those who cannot recognise anythingunless it be clearly labelled, it comes natural to record their censure ofHegelianism for ignoring or disparaging ethical studies. But if we takethe word in that wide sense which common usage rather justifies thanadopts, we may say that the whole philosophy of Mind is a moralphilosophy. Its subject is the moral as opposed to the physical aspect ofreality: the inner and ideal life as opposed to the merely external andreal materials of it: the world of intelligence and of humanity. Itdisplays Man in the several stages of that process by which he expressesthe full meaning of nature, or discharges the burden of that task which isimplicit in him from the first. It traces the steps of that growth bywhich what was no better than a fragment of nature—an intelligence located(as it seemed) in one piece of matter—comes to realise the truth of it andof himself. That truth is his ideal and his obligation: but it isalso—such is the mystery of his birthright—his idea and possession.He—like the natural universe—is (as the _Logic_ has shown) a principle ofunification, organisation, idealisation: and his history (in its idealcompleteness) is the history of the process by which he, the typical man,works the fragments of reality (and such mere reality must be always acollection of fragments) into the perfect unity of a many-sided character.Thus the philosophy of mind, beginning with man as a sentient organism,the focus in which the universe gets its first dim confused expressionthrough mere feeling, shows how he “erects himself above himself” andrealises what ancient thinkers called his kindred with the divine."|FALSE
39064|"In that total process of the mind’s liberation and self-realisation theportion specially called Morals is but one, though a necessary, stage.There are, said Porphyry and the later Platonists, four degrees in thepath of perfection and self-accomplishment. And first, there is the careerof honesty and worldly prudence, which makes the duty of the citizen.Secondly, there is the progress in purity which casts earthly thingsbehind, and reaches the angelic height of passionless serenity. And thethird step is the divine life which by intellectual energy is turned tobehold the truth of things. Lastly, in the fourth grade, the mind, freeand sublime in self-sustaining wisdom, makes itself an “exemplar” ofvirtue, and is even a “father of Gods.” Even so, it may be said, the humanmind is the subject of a complicated Teleology,—the field ruled by amultifarious Ought, psychological, aesthetical, social and religious. Toadjust their several claims cannot be the object of any science, ifadjustment means to supply a guide in practice. But it is the purpose ofsuch a teleology to show that social requirements and moral duty asordinarily conceived do not exhaust the range of obligation,—of thesupreme ethical Ought. How that can best be done is however a question ofsome difficulty. For the ends under examination do not fall completelyinto a serial order, nor does one involve others in such a way as todestroy their independence. You cannot absolve psychology as if it stoodindependent of ethics or religion, nor can aesthetic considerations merelysupervene on moral. Still, it may be said, the order followed by Hegelseems on the whole liable to fewer objections than others."|FALSE
39064|"Mr. Herbert Spencer, the only English philosopher who has even attempted a_System_ of Philosophy, may in this point be compared with Hegel. He alsobegins with a _First Principles_,—a work which, like Hegel’s _Logic_,starts by presenting Philosophy as the supreme arbiter between thesubordinate principles of Religion and Science, which are in it “necessarycorrelatives.” The positive task of philosophy is (with some inconsistencyor vagueness) presented, in the next place, as a “unification ofknowledge.” Such a unification has to make explicit the implicit unity ofknown reality: because “every thought involves a whole system ofthoughts.” And such a programme might again suggest the Logic. Butunfortunately Mr. Spencer does not (and he has Francis Bacon to justifyhim here) think it worth his while to toil up the weary, but necessary,mount of Purgatory which is known to us as Logic. With a naïve realism, hebuilds on Cause and Power, and above all on Force, that “Ultimate ofUltimates,” which seems to be, however marvellously, a denizen both of theKnown and the Unknowable world. In the known world this Ultimate appearsunder two forms, matter and motion, and the problem of science andphilosophy is to lay down in detail and in general the law of theircontinuous redistribution, of the segregation of motion from matter, andthe inclusion of motion into matter."|FALSE
39064|"Of this process, which has no beginning and no end,—the rhythm ofgeneration and corruption, attraction and repulsion, it may be said thatit is properly not a first principle of all knowledge, but the general orfundamental portion of Natural Philosophy to which Mr. Spencer nextproceeds. Such a philosophy, however, he gives only in part: viz. as aBiology, dealing with organic (and at a further stage and under othernames, with supra-organic) life. And that the Philosophy of Nature shouldtake this form, and carry both the First Principles and the later portionsof the system with it, as parts of a philosophy of evolution, is what weshould have expected from the contemporaneous interests of science(2).Even a one-sided attempt to give speculative unity to those researches,which get—for reasons the scientific specialist seldom asks—the title ofbiological, is however worth noting as a recognition of the necessity of a_Natur-philosophie_,—a speculative science of Nature."|FALSE
39064|"The third part of the Hegelian System corresponds to what in the_Synthetic Philosophy_ is known as Psychology, Ethics, and Sociology. Andhere Mr. Spencer recognises that something new has turned up. Psychologyis “unique” as a science: it is a “double science,” and as a whole quite_sui generis_. Whether perhaps all these epithets would not, _mutatismutandis_, have to be applied also to Ethics and Sociology, if these areto do their full work, he does not say. In what this doubleness consistshe even finds it somewhat difficult to show. For, as his fundamentalphilosophy does not on this point go beyond noting some pairs of verbalantitheses, and has no sense of unity except in the imperfect shape of a“relation(3)” between two things which are “antithetical and inseparable,”he is perplexed by phrases such as “in” and “out of” consciousness, andstumbles over the equivocal use of “inner” to denote both mental (ornon-spatial) in general, and locally sub-cuticular in special. Still, hegets so far as to see that the law of consciousness is that in it neitherfeelings nor relations have independent subsistence, and that the unit ofmind does not begin till what he calls two feelings are made one. Thephraseology may be faulty, but it shows an inkling of the _a priori_.Unfortunately it is apparently forgotten; and the language too oftenreverts into the habit of what he calls the “objective,” i.e. purelyphysical, sciences."|FALSE
39064|"Mr. Spencer’s conception of Psychology restricts it to the more generalphysics of the mind. For its more concrete life he refers us to Sociology.But his Sociology is yet unfinished: and from the plan of its inception,and the imperfect conception of the ends and means of its investigation,hardly admits of completion in any systematic sense. To that incipiency isno doubt due its excess in historical or anecdotal detail—detail, however,too much segregated from its social context, and in general its tendencyto neglect normal and central theory for incidental and peripheral facts.Here, too, there is a weakness in First Principles and a love ofcatchwords, which goes along with the fallacy that illustration is proof.Above all, it is evident that the great fact of religion overhangs Mr.Spencer with the attraction of an unsolved and unacceptable problem. Hecannot get the religious ideas of men into co-ordination with theirscientific, aesthetic, and moral doctrines; and only betrays his sense ofthe high importance of the former by placing them in the forefront ofinquiry, as due to the inexperience and limitations of the so-calledprimitive man. That is hardly adequate recognition of the religiousprinciple: and the defect will make itself seriously felt, should he evercome to carry out the further stage of his prospectus dealing with “thegrowth and correlation of language, knowledge, morals, and aesthetics.”"|FALSE
39064|"(ii.) Mind and Morals."|FALSE
39064|"A Mental Philosophy—if we so put what might also be rendered a SpiritualPhilosophy, or Philosophy of Spirit—may to an English reader suggestsomething much narrower than it actually contains. A Philosophy of theHuman Mind—if we consult English specimens—would not imply much more thana psychology, and probably what is called an inductive psychology. But asHegel understands it, it covers an unexpectedly wide range of topics, thewhole range from Nature to Spirit. Besides Subjective Mind, which wouldseem on first thoughts to exhaust the topics of psychology, it goes on toMind as Objective, and finally to Absolute mind. And such combinations ofwords may sound either self-contradictory or meaningless."|FALSE
39064|"The first Section deals with the range of what is usually termedPsychology. That term indeed is employed by Hegel, in a restricted sense,to denote the last of the three sub-sections in the discussion ofSubjective Mind. The Mind, which is the topic of psychology proper, cannotbe assumed as a ready-made object, or datum. A Self, a self-consciousness,an intelligent and volitional agent, if it be the birthright of man, is abirthright which he has to realise for himself, to earn and to make hisown. To trace the steps by which mind in its stricter acceptation, as willand intelligence, emerges from the general animal sensibility which is thecrowning phase of organic life, and the final problem of biology, is thework of two preliminary sub-sections—the first entitled _Anthropology_,the second the _Phenomenology of Mind_."|FALSE
39064|"The subject of Anthropology, as Hegel understands it, is the Soul—the rawmaterial of consciousness, the basis of all higher mental life. This is aborderland, where the ground is still debateable between Nature and Mind:it is the region of feeling, where the sensibility has not yet beendifferentiated to intelligence. Soul and body are here, as the phrasegoes, in communion: the inward life is still imperfectly disengaged fromits natural co-physical setting. Still one with nature, it submits tonatural influences and natural vicissitudes: is not as yet master ofitself, but the half-passive receptacle of a foreign life, of a generalvitality, of a common soul not yet fully differentiated intoindividuality. But it is awaking to self-activity: it is emerging toConsciousness,—to distinguish itself, as aware and conscious, from thefacts of life and sentiency of which it is aware."|FALSE
39064|"From this region of psychical physiology or physiological psychology,Hegel in the second sub-section of his first part takes us to the“Phenomenology of Mind,”—to Consciousness. The sentient soul is alsoconscious—but in a looser sense of that word(4): it has feelings, but canscarcely be said _itself_ to know that it has them. As consciousness, theSoul has come to separate what it is from what it feels. The distinctionemerges of a subject which is conscious, and an object _of_ which it isconscious. And the main thing is obviously the relationship between thetwo, or the Consciousness itself, as tending to distinguish itself alikefrom its subject and its object. Hence, perhaps, may be gathered why it iscalled Phenomenology of Mind. Mind as yet is not yet more than emergent orapparent: nor yet self-possessed and self-certified. No longer, however,one with the circumambient nature which it feels, it sees itself setagainst it, but only as a passive recipient of it, a _tabula rasa_ onwhich external nature is reflected, or to which phenomena are presented.No longer, on the other hand, a mere passive instrument of suggestion fromwithout, its instinct of life, its _nisus_ of self-assertion is developed,through antagonism to a like _nisus_, into the consciousness of self-hood,of a Me and Mine as set against a Thee and Thine. But just in proportionas it is so developed in opposition to and recognition of other equallyself-centred selves, it has passed beyond the narrower characteristic ofConsciousness proper. It is no longer mere intelligent perception orreproduction of a world, but it is life, with perception (or apperception)of that life. It has returned in a way to its original unity with nature,but it is now the sense of its self-hood—the consciousness of itself asthe focus in which subjective and objective are at one. Or, to put it inthe language of the great champion of Realism(5), the standpoint of Reasonor full-grown Mind is this: “The world which appears to us is our percept,therefore in us. The real world, out of which we explain the phenomenon,is our thought: therefore in us.”"|FALSE
39064|"The third sub-section of the theory of Subjective Mind—the Psychologyproper—deals with Mind. This is the real, independent Psyché—hence thespecial appropriation of the term Psychology. “The Soul,” says Herbart,“no doubt dwells in a body: there are, moreover, corresponding states ofthe one and the other: but nothing corporeal occurs in the Soul, nothingpurely mental, which we could reckon to our Ego, occurs in the body: theaffections of the body are no representations of the Ego, and our pleasantand unpleasant feelings do not immediately lie in the organic life theyfavour or hinder.” Such a Soul, so conceived, is an intelligent andvolitional self, a being of intellectual and “active” powers or phenomena:it is a Mind. And “Mind,” adds Hegel(6), “is just this elevation aboveNature and physical modes and above the complication with an externalobject.” Nothing is _external_ to it: it is rather the internalising ofall externality. In this psychology proper, we are out of any immediateconnexion with physiology. “Psychology as such,” remarks Herbart, “has itsquestions common to it with Idealism”—with the doctrine that all realityis mental reality. It traces, in Hegel’s exposition of it, the steps ofthe way by which mind realises that independence which is itscharacteristic stand-point. On the intellectual side that independence isassured in language,—the system of signs by which the intelligence stampsexternal objects as its own, made part of its inner world. A science, someone has said, is after all only _une langue bien faite_. So, reversing thesaying, we may note that a language is an inwardised and mind-appropriatedworld. On the active side, the independence of mind is seen inself-enjoyment, in happiness, or self-content, where impulse and volitionhave attained satisfaction in equilibrium, and the soul possesses itselfin fullness. Such a mind(7), which has made the world its certifiedpossession in language, and which enjoys itself in self-possession ofsoul, called happiness, is a free Mind. And that is the highest whichSubjective Mind can reach."|FALSE
39064|"At this point, perhaps, having rounded off by a liberal sweep the scope ofpsychology, the ordinary mental philosophy would stop. Hegel, instead offinishing, now goes on to the field of what he calls Objective Mind. Foras yet it has been only the story of a preparation, an inward adorning andequipment, and we have yet to see what is to come of it in actuality. Orrather, we have yet to consider the social forms on which this preparationrests. The mind, self-possessed and sure of itself or free, is so onlythrough the objective shape which its main development runs parallel with.An intelligent Will, or a practical reason, was the last word of thepsychological development. But a reason which is practical, or a volitionwhich is intelligent, is realised by action which takes regular shapes,and by practice which transforms the world. The theory of Objective Minddelineates the new form which nature assumes under the sway ofintelligence and will. That intellectual world realises itself bytransforming the physical into a social and political world, the givennatural conditions of existence into a freely-instituted system of life,the primitive struggle of kinds for subsistence into the ordinances of thesocial state. Given man as a being possessed of will and intelligence,this inward faculty, whatever be its degree, will try to impress itself onnature and to reproduce itself in a legal, a moral, and social world. Thekingdom of deed replaces, or rises on the foundation of, the kingdom ofword: and instead of the equilibrium of a well-adjusted soul comes theharmonious life of a social organism. We are, in short, in the sphere ofEthics and Politics, of Jurisprudence and Morals, of Law and Conscience."|FALSE
39064|"Here,—as always in Hegel’s system—there is a triad of steps. First theprovince of Law or Right. But if we call it Law, we must keep out of sightthe idea of a special law-giver, of a conscious imposition of laws, aboveall by a political superior. And if we call it Right, we must rememberthat it is neutral, inhuman, abstract right: the right whose principle isimpartial and impassive uniformity, equality, order;—not moral right, orthe equity which takes cognisance of circumstances, of personal claims,and provides against its own hardness. The intelligent will of Man,throwing itself upon the mere gifts of nature as their appointed master,creates the world of Property—of things instrumental, and regarded asadjectival, to the human personality. But the autonomy of Reason (which islatent in the will) carries with it certain consequences. As it acts, italso, by its inherent quality of uniformity or universality, enacts foritself a law and laws, and creates the realm of formal equality ororder-giving law. But this is a _mere_ equality: which is not inconsistentwith what in other respects may be excess of inequality. What one does, ifit is really to be treated as done, others may or even must do: each actcreates an expectation of continuance and uniformity of behaviour. Thedoer is bound by it, and others are entitled to do the like. The materialwhich the person appropriates creates a system of obligation. Thus isconstituted—in the natural give and take of rational Wills—in theinevitable course of human action and reaction,—a system of rights andduties. This law of equality—the basis of justice, and the seed ofbenevolence—is the scaffolding or perhaps rather the rudimentary frameworkof society and moral life. Or it is the bare skeleton which is to beclothed upon by the softer and fuller outlines of the social tissues andthe ethical organs."|FALSE
39064|"And thus the first range of Objective Mind postulates the second, whichHegel calls “Morality.” The word is to be taken in its strict sense as aprotest against the quasi-physical order of law. It is the morality ofconscience and of the good will, of the inner rectitude of soul andpurpose, as all-sufficient and supreme. Here is brought out thecomplementary factor in social life: the element of liberty, spontaneity,self-consciousness. The motto of mere inward morality (as opposed to thespirit of legality) is (in Kant’s words): “There is nothing withoutqualification good, in heaven or earth, but only a good will.” Theessential condition of goodness is that the action be done with purposeand intelligence, and in full persuasion of its goodness by the conscienceof the agent. The characteristic of Morality thus described is itsessential inwardness, and the sovereignty of the conscience over allheteronomy. Its justification is that it protests against the authority ofa mere external or objective order, subsisting and ruling in separationfrom the subjectivity. Its defect is the turn it gives to this assertionof the rights of subjective conscience: briefly in the circumstance thatit tends to set up a mere individualism against a mere universalism,instead of realising the unity and essential interdependence of the two."|FALSE
39064|"The third sub-section of the theory of Objective Mind describes a state ofaffairs in which this antithesis is explicitly overcome. This is the morallife in a social community. Here law and usage prevail and provide thefixed permanent scheme of life: but the law and the usage are, in theirtrue or ideal conception, only the unforced expression of the mind andwill of those who live under them. And, on the other hand, the mind andwill of the individual members of such a community are pervaded andanimated by its universal spirit. In such a community, and so constitutingit, the individual is at once free and equal, and that because of thespirit of fraternity, which forms its spiritual link. In the worldsupposed to be governed by mere legality the idea of right is exclusivelyprominent; and when that is the case, it may often happen that _summum jussumma injuria_. In mere morality, the stress falls exclusively on the ideaof inward freedom, or the necessity of the harmony of the judgment and thewill, or the dependence of conduct upon conscience. In the union of thetwo, in the moral community as normally constituted, the mere idea ofright is replaced, or controlled and modified, by the idea of equity—abalance as it were between the two preceding, inasmuch as motive andpurpose are employed to modify and interpret strict right. But thiseffect—this harmonisation—is brought about by the predominance of a newidea—the principle of benevolence,—a principle however which is itselfmodified by the fundamental idea of right or law(8) into a wise orregulated kindliness."|FALSE
39064|"But what Hegel chiefly deals with under this head is the interdependenceof form and content, of social order and personal progress. In the pictureof an ethical organisation or harmoniously-alive moral community he showsus partly the underlying idea which gave room for the antithesis betweenlaw and conscience, and partly the outlines of the ideal in which thatconflict becomes only the instrument of progress. This organisation hasthree grades or three typical aspects. These are the Family, CivilSociety, and the State. The first of these, the Family, must be taken toinclude those primary unities of human life where the natural affinity ofsex and the natural ties of parentage are the preponderant influence informing and maintaining the social group. This, as it were, is thesoul-nucleus of social organisation: where the principle of unity is aninstinct, a feeling, an absorbing solidarity. Next comes what Hegel hascalled Civil Society,—meaning however by civil the antithesis topolitical, the society of those who may be styled _bourgeois_, not_citoyens_:—and meaning by society the antithesis to community. There areother natural influences binding men together besides those which form theclose unities of the family, gens, tribe, or clan. Economical needsassociate human beings within a much larger radius—in ways capable ofalmost indefinite expansion—but also in a way much less intense and deep.Civil Society is the more or less loosely organised aggregate of suchassociations, which, if, on one hand, they keep human life from stagnatingin the mere family, on another, accentuate more sharply the tendency tocompetition and the struggle for life. Lastly, in the Political Statecomes the synthesis of family and society. Of the family; in so far as theState tends to develope itself on the nature-given unit of the Nation (anextended family, supplementing as need arises real descent by fictitiousincorporations), and has apparently never permanently maintained itselfexcept on the basis of a predominant common nationality. Of society; in sofar as the extension and dispersion of family ties have left free room forthe differentiation of many other sides of human interest and action, andgiven ground for the full development of individuality. In consequence ofthis, the State (and such a state as Hegel describes is essentially theidea or ideal of the modern State)(9) has a certain artificial air aboutit. It can only be maintained by the free action of intelligence: it mustmake its laws public: it must bring to consciousness the principles of itsconstitution, and create agencies for keeping up unity of organisationthrough the several separate provinces or contending social interests,each of which is inclined to insist on the right of home mis-rule."|FALSE
39064|"The State—which in its actuality must always be a quasi-national state—isthus the supreme unity of Nature and Mind. Its natural basis in land,language, blood, and the many ties which spring therefrom, has to beconstantly raised into an intelligent unity through universal interests.But the elements of race and of culture have no essential connexion, andthey perpetually incline to wrench themselves asunder. Blood and judgmentare for ever at war in the state as in the individual(10): thecosmopolitan interest, to which the maxim is _Ubi bene, ibi patria_,resists the national, which adopts the patriotic watchword of Hector(11).The State however has another source of danger in the very principle thatgave it birth. It arose through antagonism: it was baptised on thebattlefield, and it only lives as it is able to assert itself against aforeign foe. And this circumstance tends to intensify and even pervert itsnatural basis of nationality:—tends to give the very conception of thepolitical a negative and superficial look. But, notwithstanding all thesedrawbacks, the State in its Idea is entitled to the name Hobbes gaveit,—the Mortal God. Here in a way culminates the obviously objective,—wemay almost say, visible and tangible—development of Man and Mind. Here itattains a certain completeness—a union of reality and of ideality: aquasi-immortality, a quasi-universality. What the individual person couldnot do unaided, he can do in the strength of his commonwealth. Much thatin the solitary was but implicit or potential, is in the State actualised."|FALSE
39064|"But the God of the State is a mortal God. It is but a national and alimited mind. To be actual, one must at least begin by restrictingoneself. Or, rather actuality is rational, but always with a conditionedand a relative rationality(12): it is in the realm of action andre-action,—in the realm of change and nature. It has warring forcesoutside it,—warring forces inside it. Its unity is never perfect: becauseit never produces a true identity of interests within, or maintains anabsolute independence without. Thus the true and real State—the State inits Idea—the realisation of concrete humanity,—of Mind as the fullness andunity of nature—is not reached in any single or historical State: butfloats away, when we try to seize it, into the endless progress ofhistory. Always indeed the State, the historical and objective, pointsbeyond itself. It does so first in the succession of times. _DieWeltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht._(13) And in that doom of the world theeternal blast sweeps along the successive generations of the temporal, oneexpelling another from the stage of time—each because it is inadequate tothe Idea which it tried to express, and has succumbed to an enemy fromwithout because it was not a real and true unity within."|FALSE
39064|"But if temporal flees away before another temporal, it abides in so far asit has, however inadequately, given expression and visible reality—as itpoints inward and upward—to the eternal. The earthly state is also thecity of God; and if the republic of Plato seems to find scant admissioninto the reality of flesh and blood, it stands eternal as a witness in theheaven of idea. Behind the fleeting succession of consulates anddictatures, of aristocracy and empire, feuds of plebeian with patrician,in that apparent anarchy of powers which the so-called Roman constitutionis to the superficial observer, there is the eternal Rome, one, strong,victorious, _semper eadem_: the Rome of Virgil and Justinian, the ghostwhereof still haunts with memories the seven-hilled city, but which withfull spiritual presence lives in the law, the literature, the manners ofthe modern world. To find fitter expression for this Absolute Mind than ithas in the Ethical community—to reach that reality of which the moralworld is but one-sidedly representative—is the work of Art, Religion, andPhilosophy. And to deal with these efforts to find the truth and the unityof Mind and Nature is the subject of Hegel’s third Section."|FALSE
39064|"(iii.) Religion and Philosophy."|FALSE
39064|"It may be well at this point to guard against a misconception of thisserial order of exposition(14). As stage is seen to follow stage, thehistorical imagination, which governs our ordinary current of ideas, turnsthe logical dependence into a time-sequence. But it is of course not meantthat the later stage follows the earlier in history. The later is the morereal, and therefore the more fundamental. But we can only understand byabstracting and then transcending our abstractions, or rather by showinghow the abstraction implies relations which force us to go further andbeyond our arbitrary arrest. Each stage therefore either stands to thatpreceding it as an antithesis, which inevitably dogs its steps as anaccusing spirit, or it is the conjunction of the original thesis with theantithesis, in a union which should not be called synthesis because it isa closer fusion and true marriage of minds. A truth and reality, thoughfundamental, is only appreciated at its true value and seen in all itsforce where it appears as the reconciliation and reunion of partial andopposing points of view. Thus, e.g., the full significance of the Statedoes not emerge so long as we view it in isolation as a supposed singlestate, but only as it is seen in the conflict of history, in its actual“energy” as a world-power among powers, always pointing beyond itself to asomething universal which it fain would be, and yet cannot be. Or, again,there never was a civil or economic society which existed save under thewing of a state, or in one-sided assumption of state powers to itself: anda family is no isolated and independent unit belonging to a supposedpatriarchal age, but was always mixed up with, and in manifold dependenceupon, political and civil combinations. The true family, indeed, far frompreceding the state in time, presupposes the political power to give itits precise sphere and its social stability: as is well illustrated bythat typical form of it presented in the Roman state."|FALSE
39064|"So, again, religion does not supervene upon an already existing politicaland moral system and invest it with an additional sanction. The true orderwould be better described as the reverse. The real basis of social life,and even of intelligence, is religion. As some thinkers quaintly put it,the known rests and lives on the bosom of the Unknowable. But when we saythat, we must at once guard against a misconception. There are religionsof all sorts; and some of them which are most heard of in the modern worldonly exist or survive in the shape of a traditional name and veneratedcreed which has lost its power. Nor is a religion necessarily committed toa definite conception of a supernatural—of a personal power outside theorder of Nature. But in all cases, religion is a faith and a theory whichgives unity to the facts of life, and gives it, not because the unity isin detail proved or detected, but because life and experience in theirdeepest reality inexorably demand and evince such a unity to the heart.The religion of a time is not its nominal creed, but its dominantconviction of the meaning of reality, the principle which animates all itsbeing and all its striving, the faith it has in the laws of nature and thepurpose of life. Dimly or clearly felt and perceived, religion has for itsprinciple (one cannot well say, its object) not the unknowable, but theinner unity of life and knowledge, of act and consciousness, a unity whichis certified in its every knowledge, but is never fully demonstrable bythe summation of all its ascertained items. As such a felt and believedsynthesis of the world and life, religion is the unity which givesstability and harmony to the social sphere; just as morality in its turngives a partial and practical realisation to the ideal of religion. Butreligion does not merely establish and sanction morality; it also frees itfrom a certain narrowness it always has, as of the earth. Or, otherwiseput, morality has to the keener inspection something in it which is morethan the mere moral injunction at first indicates. Beyond the moral, inits stricter sense, as the obligatory duty and the obedience to law, risesand expands the beautiful and the good: a beautiful which isdisinterestedly loved, and a goodness which has thrown off all utilitarianrelativity, and become a free self-enhancing joy. The true spirit ofreligion sees in the divine judgment not a mere final sanction to humanmorality which has failed of its earthly close, not the re-adjustment ofsocial and political judgments in accordance with our more conscientiousinner standards, but a certain, though, for our part-by-part vision,incalculable proportion between what is done and suffered. And in thisliberation of the moral from its restrictions, Art renders no slight aid.Thus in different ways, religion presupposes morality to fill up itsvacant form, and morality presupposes religion to give its laws anultimate sanction, which at the same time points beyond their limitations."|FALSE
39064|"But art, religion, and philosophy still rest on the national culture andon the individual mind. However much they rise in the heights of the idealworld, they never leave the reality of life and circumstance behind, andfloat in the free empyrean. Yet there are degrees of universality, degreesin which they reach what they promised. As the various psychical _nuclei_of an individual consciousness tend through the course of experience togather round a central idea and by fusion and assimilation form a completemental organisation; so, through the march of history, there grows up acomplication and a fusion of national ideas and aspirations, which, thoughstill retaining the individuality and restriction of a concrete nationallife, ultimately present an organisation social, aesthetic, and religiouswhich is a type of humanity in its universality and completeness. Alwaysmoving in the measure and on the lines of the real development of itssocial organisation, the art and religion of a nation tend to giveexpression to what social and political actuality at its best butimperfectly sets in existence. They come more and more to be, not merecompeting fragments as set side by side with those of others, butcomparatively equal and complete representations of the many-sided andmany-voiced reality of man and the world. Yet always they live andflourish in reciprocity with the fullness of practical institutions andindividual character. An abstractly universal art and religion is adelusion—until all diversities of geography and climate, of language andtemperament, have been made to disappear. If these energies are in powerand reality and not merely in name, they cannot be applied like a panaceaor put on like a suit of ready-made clothes. If alive, they grow withindividualised type out of the social situation: and they can only attaina vulgar and visible universality, so far as they attach themselves tosome simple and uniform aspects,—a part tolerably identical everywhere—inhuman nature in all times and races."|FALSE
39064|"Art, according to Hegel’s account, is the first of the three expressionsof Absolute Mind. But the key-note to the whole is to be found inReligion(15): or Religion is the generic description of that phase of mindwhich has found rest in the fullness of attainment and is no longer astruggle and a warfare, but a fruition. “It is the conviction of allnations,” he says(16), “that in the religious consciousness they holdtheir truth; and they have always regarded religion as their dignity andas the Sunday of their life. Whatever excites our doubts and alarms, allgrief and all anxiety, all that the petty fields of finitude can offer toattract us, we leave behind on the shoals of time: and as the traveller onthe highest peak of a mountain range, removed from every distinct view ofthe earth’s surface, quietly lets his vision neglect all the restrictionsof the landscape and the world; so in this pure region of faith man,lifted above the hard and inflexible reality, sees it with his mind’s eyereflected in the rays of the mental sun to an image where its discords,its lights and shades, are softened to eternal calm. In this region ofmind flow the waters of forgetfulness, from which Psyche drinks, and inwhich she drowns all her pain: and the darknesses of this life are heresoftened to a dream-image, and transfigured into a mere setting for thesplendours of the Eternal.’”"|FALSE
39064|"If we take Religion, in this extended sense, we find it is the sense, thevision, the faith, the certainty of the eternal in the changeable, of theinfinite in the finite, of the reality in appearance, of the truth inerror. It is freedom from the distractions and pre-occupations of theparticular details of life; it is the sense of permanence, repose,certainty, rounding off, toning down and absorbing the vicissitude, therestlessness, the doubts of actual life. Such a victory over palpablereality has no doubt its origin—its embryology—in phases of mind whichhave been already discussed in the first section. Religion will varyenormously according to the grade of national mood of mind and socialdevelopment in which it emerges. But whatever be the peculiarities of itsoriginal swaddling-clothes, its cardinal note will be a sense ofdependence on, and independence in, something more permanent, more august,more of a surety and stay than visible and variable nature andman,—something also which whether God or devil, or both in one, holds thekeys of life and death, of weal and woe, and holds them from some safevantage-ground above the lower realms of change. By this central being theoutward and the inward, past and present and to come, are made one. And asalready indicated, Religion, emerging, as it does, from social man, frommind ethical, will retain traces of the two _foci_ in society: theindividual subjectivity and the objective community. Retain them howeveronly as traces, which still show in the actually envisaged reconciliation.For that is what religion does to morality. It carries a step higher theunity or rather combination gained in the State: it is the fuller harmonyof the individual and the collectivity. The moral conscience rests incertainty and fixity on the religious."|FALSE
39064|"But Religion (thus widely understood as the faith in sempiternal andall-explaining reality) at first appears under a guise of Art. The poemand the pyramid, the temple-image and the painting, the drama and thefairy legend, these are religion: but they are, perhaps, religion as Art.And that means that they present the eternal under sensiblerepresentations, the work of an artist, and in a perishable material oflimited range. Yet even the carvers of a long-past day whose works havebeen disinterred from the plateaux of Auvergne knew that they gave to theperishable life around them a quasi-immortality: and the myth-teller of asavage tribe elevated the incident of a season into a perennial power oflove and fear.

39064|"And yet it may be said in reply to the cynic that, had it not been for thedeep-imprinted lesson of the artist, it would have been but a brutalinstinct that would have drawn our eyes. The artist, the poet, themusician, reveal the meaning, the truth, the reality of the world: theyteach us, they help us, backward younger brothers, to see, to hear, tofeel what our rude senses had failed to detect. They enact the miracle ofthe loaves and fishes, again and again: out of the common limited thingsof every day they produce a bread of life in which the generationscontinue to find nourishment."|FALSE
39064|"But if Art embodies for us the unseen and the eternal, it embodies it inthe stone, the colour, the tone, and the word: and these are by themselvesonly dead matter. To the untutored eye and taste the finestpicture-gallery is only a weariness: when the national life has driftedaway, the sacred book and the image are but idols and enigmas. “Thestatues are now corpses from which the vivifying soul has fled, and thehymns are words whence faith has departed: the tables of the Gods arewithout spiritual meat and drink, and games and feasts no longer affordthe mind its joyful union with the being of being. The works of the Muselack that intellectual force which knew itself strong and real by crushinggods and men in its winepress. They are now (in this iron age) what theyare for us,—fair fruits broken from the tree, and handed to us by a kindlydestiny. But the gift is like the fruits which the girl in the picturepresents: she does not give the real life of their existence, not the treewhich bore them, not the earth and the elements which entered into theirsubstance, nor the climate which formed their quality, nor the change ofseasons which governed the process of their growth. Like her, Destiny ingiving us the works of ancient art does not give us their world, not thespring and summer of the ethical life in which they blossomed and ripened,but solely a memory and a suggestion of this actuality. Our act inenjoying them, therefore, is not a Divine service: were it so, our mindwould achieve its perfect and satisfying truth. All that we do is a mereexternalism, which from these fruits wipes off some rain-drop, some speckof dust, and which, in place of the inward elements of moral actualitythat created and inspired them, tries from the dead elements of theirexternal reality, such as language and historical allusion, to set up atedious mass of scaffolding, not in order to live ourselves into them, butonly to form a picture of them in our minds. But as the girl who proffersthe plucked fruits is more and nobler than the natural element with allits details of tree, air, light, &c. which first yielded them, because shegathers all this together, in a nobler way, into the glance of theconscious eye and the gesture which proffers them; so the spirit ofdestiny which offers us those works of art is more than the ethical lifeand actuality of the ancient people: for it is the inwardising of thatmind which in them was still self-estranged and self-dispossessed:—it isthe spirit of tragic destiny, the destiny which collects all thoseindividualised gods and attributes of substance into the one Pantheon. Andthat temple of all the gods is Mind conscious of itself as mind(17).”"|FALSE
39064|"Religion enters into its more adequate form when it ceases to appear inthe guise of Art and realises that the kingdom of God is within, that thetruth must be _felt_, the eternal _inwardly_ revealed, the holy oneapprehended by _faith_(18), not by outward vision. Eye hath not seen, norear heard, the things of God. They cannot be presented, or delineated:they come only in the witness of the spirit. The human soul itself is theonly worthy temple of the Most High, whom heaven, and the heaven ofheavens, cannot contain. Here in truth God has come down to dwell withmen; and the Son of Man, caught up in the effusion of the Spirit, can inall assurance and all humility claim that he is divinified. Hereapparently Absolute Mind is reached: the soul knows no limitation, nostruggle: in time it is already eternal. Yet, there is, according toHegel, a flaw,—not in the essence and the matter, but in the manner andmode in which the ordinary religious consciousness represents to itself,or pictures that unification which it feels and experiences."|FALSE
39064|"“In religion then this unification of ultimate Being with the Self isimplicitly reached. But the religious consciousness, if it has thissymbolic idea of its reconciliation, still has it as a mere symbol orrepresentation. It attains the satisfaction by tacking on to its purenegativity, and that externally, the positive signification of its unitywith the ultimate Being: its satisfaction remains therefore tainted by theantithesis of another world. Its own reconciliation, therefore, ispresented to its consciousness as something far away, something far awayin the future: just as the reconciliation which the other Selfaccomplished appears as a far-away thing in the past. The one Divine Manhad but an implicit father and only an actual mother; conversely theuniversal divine man, the community, has its own deed and knowledge forits father, but for its mother only the eternal Love, which it only_feels_, but does not _behold_ in its consciousness as an actual immediateobject. Its reconciliation therefore is in its heart, but still atvariance with its consciousness, and its actuality still has a flaw. Inits field of consciousness the place of implicit reality or side of puremediation is taken by the reconciliation that lies far away behind: theplace of the actually present, or the side of immediacy and existence, isfilled by the world which has still to wait for its transfiguration toglory. Implicitly no doubt the world is reconciled with the eternal Being;and that Being, it is well known, no longer looks upon the object as aliento it, but in its love sees it as like itself. But for self-consciousnessthis immediate presence is not yet set in the full light of mind. In itsimmediate consciousness accordingly the spirit of the community is partedfrom its religious: for while the religious consciousness declares thatthey are implicitly not parted, this implicitness is not raised to realityand not yet grown to absolute self-certainty(19).”"|FALSE
39064|"Religion therefore, which as it first appeared in art-worship had yet torealise its essential inwardness or spirituality, so has now to overcomethe antithesis in which its (the religious) consciousness stands to thesecular. For the peculiarly religious type of mind is distinguished by anindifference and even hostility, more or less veiled, to art, to moralityand the civil state, to science and to nature. Strong in the certainty offaith, or of its implicit rest in God, it resents too curious inquiry intothe central mystery of its union, and in its distincter consciousness setsthe foundation of faith on the evidence of a fact, which, however, it inthe same breath declares to be unique and miraculous, the central event ofthe ages, pointing back in its reference to the first days of humanity,and forward in the future to the winding-up of the business of terrestriallife. Philosophy, according to Hegel’s conception of it, does but draw theconclusion supplied by the premisses of religion: it supplements androunds off into coherence the religious implications. The unique events inJudea nearly nineteen centuries ago are for it also the first step in anew revelation of man’s relationship to God: but while it acknowledges thetranscendent interest of that age, it lays main stress on the permanenttruth then revealed, and it insists on the duty of carrying out theprinciple there awakened to all the depth and breadth of its explication.Its task—its supreme task—is to _explicate religion_. But to do so is toshow that religion is no exotic, and no _mere_ revelation from an externalsource. It is to show that religion is the truth, the complete reality, ofthe mind that lived in Art, that founded the state and sought to bedutiful and upright: the truth, the crowning fruit of all scientificknowledge, of all human affections, of all secular consciousness. Itslesson ultimately is that there is nothing essentially common or unclean:that the holy is not parted off from the true and the good and thebeautiful."|FALSE
39064|"Religion thus expanded descends from its abstract or “intelligible” world,to which it had retired from art and science, and the affairs of ordinarylife. Its God—as a true God—is not of the dead alone, but also of theliving: not a far-off supreme and ultimate Being, but also a man amongmen. Philosophy thus has to break down the middle partition-wall of life,the fence between secular and sacred. It is but religion come to itsmaturity, made at home in the world, and no longer a stranger and awonder. Religion has pronounced in its inmost heart and faith of faith,that the earth is the Lord’s, and that day unto day shows forth the divinehandiwork. But the heart of unbelief, of little faith, has hardly utteredthe word, than it forgets its assurance and leans to the conviction thatthe prince of this world is the Spirit of Evil. The mood of Théodicée isalso—but with a difference—the mood of philosophy. It asserts the ways ofProvidence: but its providence is not the God of the Moralist, or theideal of the Artist, or rather is not these only, but also the Law ofNature, and more than that. Its aim is the Unity of History. The wordshave sometimes been lightly used to mean that events run on in onecontinuous flow, and that there are no abrupt, no ultimate beginnings,parting age from age. But the Unity of History in its full sense is beyondhistory: it is history “reduced” from the expanses of time to the eternalpresent: its thousand years made one day,—made even the glance of amoment. The theme of the Unity of History—in the full depth of unity andthe full expanse of history—is the theme of Hegelian philosophy. It tracesthe process in which Mind has to be all-inclusive, self-upholding, onewith the Eternal reality."|FALSE
39064|"“That process of the mind’s self-realisation” says Hegel in the close ofhis _Phenomenology_, “exhibits a lingering movement and succession ofminds, a gallery of images, each of which, equipped with the completewealth of mind, only seems to linger because the Self has to penetrate andto digest this wealth of its Substance. As its perfection consists incoming completely to _know_ what it _is_ (its substance), this knowledgeis its self-involution in which it deserts its outward existence andsurrenders its shape to recollection. Thus self-involved, it is sunk inthe night of its self-consciousness: but in that night its vanished beingis preserved, and that being, thus in idea preserved,—old, but nownew-born of the spirit,—is the new sphere of being, a new world, a newphase of mind. In this new phase it has again to begin afresh and from thebeginning, and again nurture itself to maturity from its own resources, asif for it all that preceded were lost, and it had learned nothing from theexperience of the earlier minds. Yet is that recollection a preservationof experience: it is the quintessence, and in fact a higher form, of thesubstance. If therefore this new mind appears only to count on its ownresources, and to start quite fresh and blank, it is at the same time on ahigher grade that it starts. The intellectual and spiritual realm, whichis thus constructed in actuality, forms a succession in time, where onemind relieved another of its watch, and each took over the kingdom of theworld from the preceding. The purpose of that succession is to reveal thedepth, and that depth is the absolute comprehension of mind: thisrevelation is therefore to uplift its depth, to spread it out in breadth,so negativing this self-involved Ego, wherein it is self-dispossessed orreduced to substance. But it is also its time: the course of time showsthis dispossession itself dispossessed, and thus in its extension it is noless in its depth, the self. The way to that goal,—absoluteself-certainty—or the mind knowing itself as mind—is the inwardising ofthe minds, as they severally are in themselves, and as they accomplish theorganisation of their realm. Their conservation,—regarded on the side ofits free and apparently contingent succession of fact—is history: on theside of their comprehended organisation, again, it is the science ofmental phenomenology: the two together, comprehended history, form at oncethe recollection and the grave-yard of the absolute Mind, the actuality,truth, and certitude of his throne, apart from which he were lifeless andalone.”"|FALSE
39064|"Such in brief outline—lingering most on the points where Hegel has herebeen briefest—is the range of the Philosophy of Mind. Its aim is tocomprehend, not to explain: to put together in intelligent unity, not toanalyse into a series of elements. For it psychology is not an analysis ordescription of mental phenomena, of laws of association, of the growth ofcertain powers and ideas, but a “comprehended history” of the formation ofsubjective mind, of the intelligent, feeling, willing self or ego. For itEthics is part and only part of the great scheme or system ofself-development; but continuing into greater concreteness the normalendowment of the individual mind, and but preparing the ground on whichreligion may be most effectively cultivated. And finally Religion itself,released from its isolation and other-world sacrosanctity, is shown to beonly the crown of life, the ripest growth of actuality, and shown to be soby philosophy, whilst it is made clear that religion is the basis ofphilosophy, or that a philosophy can only go as far as the religiousstand-point allows.

It may be admitted that Mindis not all that could be wished. But neither is Spirit blameless. And, itmay be added, Hegel’s own term _Geist_ has to be unduly strained to coverso wide a region. It serves—and was no doubt meant to serve—as a sign ofthe conformity of his system with the religion which sees in God noother-world being, but our very self and mind, and which worships him inspirit and in truth. And if the use of a word like this could allay the“ancient variance” between the religious and the philosophic mood, itwould be but churlish perhaps to refuse the sign of compliance andcompromise. But whatever may be the case in German,—and even there the newwine was dangerous to the old wine-skin—it is certain that to averageEnglish ears the word Spiritual would carry us over the medium line intothe proper land of religiosity. And to do that, as we have seen, is to sinagainst the central idea: the idea that religion is of one blood with thewhole mental family, though the most graciously complete of all thesisters. Yet, however the word may be chosen, the philosophy of Hegel,like the august lady who appeared in vision to the emprisoned Boëthius,has on her garment a sign which “signifies the life which is on earth,” asalso a sign which signifies the “right law of heaven”; if her right-handholds the “book of the justice of the King omnipotent,” the sceptre in herleft is “corporal judgment against sin(20).”"|FALSE

To assert this is not, of course, to throwany doubts on the importance of the problems, or on the intrinsic value ofthe results, in the studies which have been prosecuted under that name. Itis only to note the obvious fact that a number of inquiries of somewhatdiscrepant tone, method, and tendency have all at different times coveredthemselves under the common title of psychological, and that the work oforientation is as yet incomplete.

39064|"(i.) Psychology as a Science and as a Part of Philosophy."|FALSE
39064|"The _De Anima_ of Aristotle, gathering up into one the work of Plato andhis predecessors, may be said to lay the foundation of psychology. Buteven in it, we can already see that there are two elements or aspectsstruggling for mastery: two elements not unrelated or independent, buthard to keep fairly and fully in unity. On one hand there is theconception of Soul as a part of Nature, as a grade of existence in thephysical or natural universe,—in the universe of things which suffergrowth and change, which are never entirely “without matter,” and arealways attached to or present in body. From this point of view Aristotleurged that a sound and realistic psychology must, e.g. in its definitionof a passion, give the prominent place to its physical (or material)expression, and not to its mental form or significance. It must remember,he said, that the phenomena or “accidents” are what really throw light onthe nature or the “substance” of the Soul. On the other hand, there aretwo points to be considered. There is, first of all, the counterpoisingremark that the conception of Soul as such, as a unity and commoncharacteristic, will be determinative of the phenomena or“accidents,”—will settle, as it were, what we are to observe and look for,and how we are to describe our observations. And by the _conception_ ofSoul, is meant not _a_ soul, as a thing or agent (subject) which hasproperties attaching to it; but soul, as the generic feature, theuniversal, which is set as a stamp on everything that claims to bepsychical. In other words, Soul is one, not as a single thing contrastedwith its attributes, activities, or exercises of force (such single thingwill be shown by logic to be a metaphysical fiction); but as the unity ofform and character, the comprehensive and identical feature, which ispresent in all its manifestations and exercises. But there is a secondconsideration. The question is asked by Aristotle whether it is completelyand strictly accurate to put Soul under the category of natural objects.There is in it, or of it, perhaps, something, and something essential toit, which belongs to the order of the eternal and self-active: somethingwhich is “form” and “energy” quite unaffected by and separate from“matter.” How this is related to the realm of the perishable andchangeable is a problem on which Aristotle has been often (and with somereason) believed to be obscure, if not even inconsistent(21)."|FALSE
39064|"In these divergent elements which come to the fore in Aristotle’streatment we have the appearance of a radical difference of conception andpurpose as to psychology. He himself does a good deal to keep them both inview. But it is evident that here already we have the contrast between apurely physical or (in the narrower sense) “scientific” psychology,empirical and realistic in treatment, and a more philosophical—what incertain quarters would be called a speculative or metaphysical—conceptionof the problem. There is also in Aristotle the antithesis of a popular orsuperficial, and an accurate or analytic, psychology. The former is of acertain use in dealing, say, with questions of practical ethics andeducation: the latter is of more strictly scientific interest. Both ofthese distinctions—that between a speculative and an empirical, and thatbetween a scientific and a popular treatment—affect the subsequent historyof the study. Psychology is sometimes understood to mean the results ofcasual observation of our own minds by what is termed introspection, andby the interpretation of what we may observe in others. Such observationsare in the first place carried on under the guidance of distinctions orpoints of view supplied by the names in common use. We interrogate our ownconsciousness as to what facts or relations of facts correspond to theterms of our national language. Or we attempt—what is really aninexhaustible quest—to get definite divisions between them, and clear-cutdefinitions. Inquiries like these which start from popular distinctionsfall a long way short of science: and the inquirer will find thataccidental and essential properties are given in the same handful ofconclusions. Yet there is always much value in these attempts to get ourminds cleared: and it is indispensable for all inquiries that all allegedor reported facts of mind should be realised and reproduced in our ownmental experience. And this is especially the case in psychology, justbecause here we cannot get the object outside us, we cannot get or make adiagram, and unless we give it reality by re-constructing it,—byre-interrogating our own experience, our knowledge of it will be butwooden and mechanical. And the term introspection need not be tooseriously taken: it means much more than watching passively an internaldrama; and is quite as well describable as mental projection, setting outwhat was within, and so as it were hidden and involved, before ourselvesin the field of mental vision. Here, as always, the essential point is toget ourselves well out of the way of the object observed, and to stand,figuratively speaking, quite on one side."|FALSE
39064|"But even at the best, such a popular or empirical psychology has nospecial claim to be ranked as science. It may no doubt be said that atleast it collects, describes, or notes down facts. But even this is not socertain as it seems. Its so-called facts are very largely fictions, or solargely interpolated with error, that they cannot be safely used forconstruction. If psychology is to accomplish anything valuable, it must gomore radically to work. It must—at least in a measure—discard from itspreliminary view the data of common and current distinctions, and try toget at something more primary or ultimate as its starting-point. And thisit may do in two ways. It may, in the one case, follow the example of thephysical sciences. In these it is the universal practice to assume thatthe explanation of complex and concrete facts is to be attained by (_a_)postulating certain simple elements (which we may call atoms, molecules,and perhaps units or monads), which are supposed to be clearly conceivableand to justify themselves by intrinsic intelligibility, and by (_b_)assuming that these elements are compounded and combined according to lawswhich again are in the last resort self-evident, or such that they seem tohave an obvious and palpable lucidity. Further, such laws being alwaysaxioms or plain postulates of mechanics (for these alone possess thisfeature of self-evident intelligibility), they are subject to and inviteall the aids and refinements of the higher mathematical calculus. What theprimary and self-explicative bits of psychical reality may be, is afurther question on which there may be some dispute. They may be, so tosay, taken in a more physical or in a more metaphysical way: i.e. more asunits of nerve-function or more as elements of ideative-function. Andthere may be differences as to how far and in what provinces themathematical calculus may be applicable. But, in any case, there will be astrong tendency in psychology, worked on this plan, to follow, _mutatismutandis_, and at some distance perhaps, the analogy of material physics.In both the justification of the postulated units and laws will be theirability to describe and systematise the observed phenomena in a uniformand consistent way."|FALSE
39064|"The other way in which psychology gets a foundation and ulterior certaintyis different, and goes deeper. After all, the “scientific” method is onlya way in which the facts of a given sphere are presented in thoroughgoinginterconnexion, each reduced to an exact multiple or fraction of someother, by an inimitably continued subtraction and addition of an assumedhomogeneous element, found or assumed to be perfectly imaginable(conceivable). But we may also consider the province in relation to thewhole sphere of reality, may ask what is its place and meaning in thewhole, what reality is in the end driving at or coming to be, and how farthis special province contributes to that end. If we do this, we attachpsychology to philosophy, or, if we prefer so to call it, to metaphysics,as in the former way we established it on the principles generallyreceived as governing the method of the physical sciences."|FALSE
39064|"This—the relation of psychology to fundamental philosophy—is a questionwhich also turns up in dealing with Ethics. There is on the part of thoseengaged in either of these inquiries a certain impatience against theintermeddling (which is held to be only muddling) of metaphysics withthem. It is clear that in a very decided way both psychology and ethicscan, up to some extent at least, be treated as what is called empirical(or, to use the more English phrase, inductive) sciences. On many handsthey are actually so treated: and not without result. Considering thetendency of metaphysical inquiries, it may be urged that it is well toavoid preliminary criticism of the current conceptions and beliefs aboutreality which these sciences imply. Yet such beliefs are undoubtedlypresent and effective. Schopenhauer has popularised the principle that thepure empiricist is a fiction, that man is a radically metaphysical animal,and that he inevitably turns what he receives into a part of a dogmaticcreed—a conviction how things ought to be. Almost without effort theregrows up in him, or flows in upon him, a belief and a system of beliefs asto the order and values of things. Every judgment, even in logic, rests onsuch an order of truth. He need not be able to formulate his creed: itwill influence him none the less: nay, his faith will probably seem more apart of the solid earth and common reality, the less it has been reducedto a determinate creed or to a code of principles. For such formulationpresupposes doubt and scepticism, which it beats back by mere assertion.Each human being has such a background of convictions which govern hisactions and conceptions, and of which it so startles him to suggest thepossibility of a doubt, that he turns away in dogmatic horror. Such rulingideas vary, from man to man, and from man to woman—if we consider them inall their minuteness. But above all they constitute themselves in adifferently organised system or aggregate according to the social andeducational stratum to which an individual belongs. Each group, engaged ina common task, it may be in the study of a part of nature, is ideallybound and obliged by a common language, and special standards of truth andreality for its own. Such a group of ideas is what Bacon would have calleda scientific fetich or _idolum theatri_. A scientific _idolum_ is atraditional belief or dogma as to principles, values, and methods, whichhas so thoroughly pervaded the minds of those engaged in a branch ofinquiry, that they no longer recognise its hypothetical character,—itsrelation of means to the main end of their function."|FALSE
39064|"Such a collected and united theory of reality (it is what Hegel hasdesignated the Idea) is what is understood by a natural metaphysic. It hasnothing necessarily to do with a supersensible or a supernatural, if thesewords mean a ghostly, materialised, but super-finely-materialised nature,above and beyond the present. But that there is a persistent tendency toconceive the unity and coherence, the theoretic idea of reality, in thispseudo-sensuous (i.e. super-sensuous) form, is of course a well-knownfact. For the present, however, this aberration—this idol of the tribe—maybe left out of sight. By a metaphysic or fundamental philosophy, is, inthe present instance, meant a system of first principles—a secular andcosmic creed: a belief in ends and values, a belief in truth—againpremising that the system in question is, for most, a rudely organised andalmost inarticulate mass of belief and hope, conviction and impression. Itis, in short, a _natural_ metaphysic: a metaphysic, that is, which has butan imperfect coherence, which imperfectly realises both its nature and itslimits."|FALSE
39064|"In certain parts, however, it is more and better than this crudebackground of belief. Each science—or at least every group of sciences—hasa more definite system or aggregate of first principles, axioms, andconceptions belonging to it. It has, that is,—and here in a muchdistincter way—its special standard of reality, its peculiar forms ofconceiving things, its distinctions between the actual and the apparent,&c. Here again it will probably be found that the scientific specialist ishardly conscious that these are principles and concepts: on the contrary,they will be supposed self-evident and ultimate facts, foundations ofbeing. Instead of being treated as modes of conception, more or lessjustified by their use and their results, these categories will beregarded as fundamental facts, essential conditions of all reality. Likepopular thought in its ingrained categories, the specialist cannotunderstand the possibility of any limitation to his radical ideas ofreality. To him they are not hypotheses, but principles. The scientificspecialist may be as convinced of the universal application of hispeculiar categories, as the Chinese or the Eskimo that his standards arenatural and final."|FALSE
39064|"Under such metaphysical or extra-empirical presuppositions allinvestigation, whether it be crudely empirical or (in the physical sense)scientific, is carried on. And when so carried on, it is said to beprosecuted apart from any interference from metaphysic. Such a naïve ornatural metaphysic, not raised to explicit consciousness, not followed asan imposed rule, but governing with the strength of an immanent faith,does not count for those who live under it as a metaphysic at all. M.Jourdain was amazed suddenly to learn he had been speaking prose for fortyyears without knowing it. But in the present case there is something worsethan amazement sure to be excited by the news. For the critic who thusreveals the secrets of the scientist’s heart is pretty sure to go on tosay that a good deal of this naïve unconscious metaphysic is incoherent,contradictory, even bad: that it requires correction, revision, andreadjustment, and has by criticism to be made one and harmonious. Thatreadjustment or criticism which shall eliminate contradiction and produceunity, is the aim of the _science_ of metaphysic—the science of themeta-physical element in physical knowledge: what Hegel has chosen to callthe Science of Logic (in the wide sense of the term). This higher Logic,this _science_ of metaphysic, is the process to revise and harmonise insystematic completeness the imperfect or misleading and partial estimatesof reality which are to be found in popular and scientific thought."|FALSE
39064|"In the case of the run of physical sciences this revision is lessnecessary; and for no very recondite reason. Every science by its verynature deals with a special, a limited topic. It is confined to a part oraspect of reality. Its propositions are not complete truths; they apply toan artificial world, to a part expressly cut off from the concretereality. Its principles are generally cut according to theircloth,—according to the range in which they apply. The only danger thatcan well arise is if these categories are transplanted without duereservations, and made of universal application, i.e. if the scientistelects on his speciality to pronounce _de omnibus rebus_. But in the caseof psychology and ethics the harmlessness of natural metaphysics will beless certain. Here a general human or universal interest is almost aninevitable coefficient: especially if they really rise to the full sweepof the subject. For as such they both seem to deal not with a part ofreality, but with the very centre and purpose of all reality. In them weare not dealing with topics of secondary interest, but with the very heartof the human problem. Here the questions of reality and ideals, of unityand diversity, and of the evaluation of existence, come distinctly to thefore. If psychology is to answer the question, What am I? and ethics thequestion, What ought I to do? they can hardly work without some formulatedcreed of metaphysical character, without some preliminary criticisms ofcurrent first principles."|FALSE
39064|"(ii.) Herbart."|FALSE
39064|"The German thinker, who has given perhaps the most fruitful stimulus tothe scientific study of psychology in modern times—Johann FriedrichHerbart—is after all essentially a philosopher, and not a mere scientist,even in his psychology. His psychological inquiry, that is, stands inintimate connexion with the last questions of all intelligence, withmetaphysics and ethics. The business of philosophy, says Herbart, is totouch up and finish off conceptions (_Bearbeitung der Begriffe_)(22). Itfinds, as it supervenes upon the unphilosophical world, that mere and purefacts (if there ever are or were such purisms) have been enveloped in acloud of theory, have been construed into some form of unity, but havebeen imperfectly, inadequately construed: and that the existing conceptsin current use need to be corrected, supplemented and readjusted. It has,accordingly, for its work to “reconcile experience with itself(23),” andto elicit “the hidden pre-suppositions without which the fact ofexperience is unthinkable.” Psychology, then, as a branch of thisphilosophic enterprise, has to readjust the facts discovered in innerexperience. For mere uncritical experience or merely empirical knowledgeonly offers _problems_; it suggests gaps, which indeed further reflectionserves at first only to deepen into contradictions. Such a psychology is“speculative”: i.e. it is not content to accept the mere given, but goesforward and backward to find something that will make the factintelligible. It employs totally different methods from the“classification, induction, analogy” familiar to the logic of theempirical sciences. Its “principles,” therefore, are not given facts: butfacts which have been manipulated and adjusted so as to lose theirself-contradictory quality: they are facts “reduced,” by introducing theomitted relationships which they postulate if they are to be true andself-consistent(24). While it is far from rejecting or ignoringexperience, therefore, psychology cannot strictly be said to build upon italone. It uses experimental fact as an unfinished datum,—or it sees inexperience a torso which betrays its imperfection, and suggestscompleting."|FALSE
39064|"The starting-point, it may be said, of Herbart’s psychology is a questionwhich to the ordinary psychologist (and to the so-called scientificpsychologist) has a secondary, if it have any interest. It was, he says,the problem of Personality, the problem of the Self or Ego, which firstled to his characteristic conception of psychological method. “My firstdiscovery,” he tells us(25), “was that the Self was neither primitive norindependent, but must be the most dependent and most conditioned thing onecan imagine. The second was that the elementary ideas of an intelligentbeing, if they were ever to reach the pitch of self-consciousness, must beeither all, or at least in part, opposed to each other, and that they mustcheck or block one another in consequence of this opposition. Though heldin check, however, these ideas were not to be supposed lost: they subsistas endeavours or tendencies to return into the position of actual idea, assoon as the check became, for any reason, either in whole or in partinoperative. This check could and must be calculated, and thus it wasclear that psychology required a mathematical as well as a metaphysicalfoundation.”"|FALSE
39064|"The place of the conception of the Ego in Kant’s and Fichte’s theory ofknowledge is well known. Equally well known is Kant’s treatment of thesoul-reality or soul-substance in his examination of Rational Psychology.Whereas the (logical) unity of consciousness, or “synthetic unity ofapperception,” is assumed as a fundamental starting-point in explanationof our objective judgments, or of our knowledge of objective existence,its real (as opposed to its formal) foundation in a “substantial” soul isset aside as an illegitimate interpretation of, or inference from, thefacts of inner experience. The belief in the separate unity andpersistence of the soul, said Kant, is not a scientifically-warrantedconclusion. Its true place is as an ineffaceable postulate of the faithwhich inspires human life and action. Herbart did not rest content witheither of these—as he believed—dogmatic assumptions of his master. He didnot fall in cheerfully with the idealism which seemed ready to dispensewith a soul, or which justified its acceptance of empirical reality byreferring to the fundamental unity of the function of judgment. With astrong bent towards fully-differentiated and individualised experienceHerbart conjoined a conviction of the need of logical analysis to preventus being carried away by the first-come and inadequate generalities. TheEgo which, in its extremest abstraction, he found defined as the unity ofsubject and object, did not seem to him to offer the proper guarantees ofreality: it was itself a problem, full of contradictions, waiting forsolution. On the other hand, the real Ego, or self of concrete experience,is very much more than this logical abstract, and differs widely fromindividual to individual, and apparently from time to time even in thesame individual. Our self, of which we talk so fluently, as one and theself-same—how far does it really possess the continuity and identity withwhich we credit it? Does it not rather seem to be an ideal which wegradually form and set before ourselves as the standard for measuring ourattainments of the moment,—the perfect fulfilment of that oneness of beingand purpose and knowledge which we never reach? Sometimes even it seems nobetter than a name which we move along the varying phenomena of our innerlife, at one time identifying it with the power which has gained thevictory in a moral struggle, at another with that which has beendefeated(26), according as the attitude of the moment makes us throw nowone, now another, aspect of mental activity in the foreground."|FALSE
39064|"The other—or logical Ego—the mere identity of subject and object,—whentaken in its utter abstractness and simplicity, shrivels up to somethingvery small indeed—to a something which is little better than nothing. Themere _I_ which is not contra-distinguished by a _Thou_ and a _He_—which iswithout all definiteness of predication (the I=I of Fichte andSchelling)—is only as it were a point of being cut off from all itsconnexions in reality, and treated as if it were or could be entirelyindependent. It is an identity in which subject and object have not yetappeared: it is not a real I, though we may still retain the name. Itis—as Hegel’s _Logic_ will tell us—exactly definable as Being, which is asyet Nothing: the impossible edge of abstraction on which we try—and invain—to steady ourselves at the initial point of thought. And to reach orstand at that intangible, ungraspable point, which slips away as weapproach, and transmutes itself as we hold it, is not the naturalbeginning, but the result of introspection and reflection on the concreteself. But with this aspect of the question we are not now concerned."|FALSE
39064|"That the unity of the Self as an intelligent and moral being, that the Egoof self-consciousness was an ideal and a product of development, was whatHerbart soon became convinced of. The unity of Self is even as given inmature experience an imperfect fact. It is a fact, that is, which does notcome up to what it promised, and which requires to be supplemented, orphilosophically justified. Here and everywhere the custom of life carriesus over gaps which yawn deep to the eye of philosophic reflection: eventhough accident and illness force them not unfrequently even upon theblindest. To trace the process of unification towards this unity—to trace,if you like, even the formation of the concept of such unity, as agoverning and guiding principle in life and conduct, comes to be theproblem of the psychologist, in the largest sense of that problem. FromSoul (_Seele_) to Mind or Spirit (_Geist_) is for Herbart, as for Hegel,the course of psychology(27). The growth and development of mind, theformation of a self, the realisation of a personality, is for both thetheme which psychology has to expound. And Herbart, not less than Hegel,had to bear the censure that such a conception of mental reality as agrowth would destroy personality(28)."|FALSE
39064|"But with so much common in the general plan, the two thinkers differprofoundly in their special mode of carrying out the task. Or, rather,they turn their strength on different departments of the whole. Herbart’sgreat practical interest had been the theory of education: “paedagogic” isthe subject of his first important writings. The inner history ofideas—the processes which are based on the interaction of elements in theindividual soul—are what he specially traces. Hegel’s interests, on thecontrary, are more towards the greater process, the unities of historicallife, and the correlations of the powers of art, religion, and philosophythat work therein. He turns to the macrocosm, almost as naturally asHerbart does to the microcosm. Thus, even in Ethics, while Herbart gives adelicate analysis of the distinct aspects or elements in the Ethicalidea,—the diverse headings under which the disinterested spectator withinthe breast measures with purely aesthetic eye his approach to unity andstrength of purpose, Hegel seems to hurry away from the field of moralsense or conscience to throw himself on the social and politicalorganisation of the moral life. The General Paedagogic of Herbart has itspendant in Hegel’s Philosophy of Law and of History."|FALSE
39064|"At an early period Herbart had become impressed with the necessity ofapplying mathematics to psychology(29). To the usual objection, thatpsychical facts do not admit of measurement, he had a ready reply. We cancalculate even on hypothetical assumptions: indeed, could we measure, weshould scarcely take the trouble to calculate(30). To calculate (i.e. todeduce mathematically) is to perform a general experiment, and to performit in the medium where there is least likelihood of error or disturbance.There may be anomalies enough apparent in the mental life: there may bethe great anomalies of Genius and of Freedom of Will; but the Newton andthe Kepler of psychology will show by calculation on assumed conditions ofpsychic nature that these aberrations can be explained by mechanical laws.“The human Soul is no puppet-theatre: our wishes and resolutions are nomarionettes: no juggler stands behind; but our true and proper life liesin our volition, and this life has its rule not outside, but in itself: ithas its own purely mental rule, by no means borrowed from the materialworld. But this rule is in it sure and fixed; and on account of this itsfixed quality it has more similarity to (what is otherwise heterogeneous)the laws of impact and pressure than to the marvels of an allegedinexplicable freedom(31).”"|FALSE
39064|"Psychology then deals with a real, which exhibits phenomena analogous inseveral respects to those discussed by statics and mechanics. Itsfoundation is a statics and mechanics of the Soul,—as this real is called.We begin by presupposing as the ultimate reality, underlying thefactitious and generally imperfect unity of self-consciousness and mind,an essential and primary unity—the unity of an absolutely simple orindividual point of being—a real point which amongst other points assertsitself, maintains itself. It has a character of its own, but thatcharacter it only shows in and through a development conditioned byexternal influences. The specific nature of the soul-reality is to berepresentative, to produce, or manifest itself in, ideas(_Vorstellungen_). But the character only emerges into actuality in theconflict of the soul-atom with other ultimate realities in thecongregation of things. A soul _per se_ or isolated is not possessed ofideas. It is merely blank, undeveloped, formal unity, of which nothing canbe said. But like other realities it defines and characterises itself byantithesis, by resistance: it shows what it is by its behaviour in thestruggle for existence. It acts in self-defence: and its peculiar style orweapon of self-defence is an idea or representation. The way the Soulmaintains itself is by turning the assailant into an idea(32): and eachidea is therefore a _Selbsterhaltung_ of the Soul. The Soul is thusenriched—to appearance or incidentally: and the assailant is annexed. Inthis way the one Soul may develop or evolve or express an innumerablevariety of ideas: for in response to whatever it meets, the living andactive Soul ideates, or gives rise to a representation. Thus, while thesoul is one, its ideas or representations are many. Taken separately, theyeach express the psychic self-conservation. But brought in relation witheach other, as so many acts or self-affirmations of the one soul, theybehave as forces, and tend to thwart or check each other. It is as forces,as reciprocally arresting or fostering each other, that ideas are objectsof science. When a representation is thus held in check, it is reduced toa mere endeavour or active tendency to represent. Thus there arises adistinction between representations proper, and those imperfect states oracts which are partly or wholly held in abeyance. But the latent phase ofan idea is as essential to a thorough understanding of it as what appears.It is the great blunder of empirical psychology to ignore what is sunkbelow the surface of consciousness. And to Herbart consciousness is notthe condition but rather the product of ideas, which are primarily forces."|FALSE
39064|"But representations are not merely in opposition,—impinging and resisting.The same reason which makes them resist, viz. that they are or would fainbe acts of the one soul, but are more or less incompatible, leads them inother circumstances to form combinations with each other. Thesecombinations are of two sorts. They are, first, complications, or“complexions”: a number of ideas combine by quasi-addition andjuxtaposition to form a total. Second, there is fusion: ideas presentingcertain degrees of contrast enter into a union where the parts are nolonger separately perceptible. It is easy to see how the problems ofpsychology now assume the form of a statics and mechanics of the mind.Quantitative data are to be sought in the strength of each separate singleidea, and the degree in which two or more ideas block each other: in thedegree of combination between ideas, and the number of ideas in acombination: and in the terms of relation between the members of a seriesof ideas. A statical theory has to show the conditions required for whatwe may call the ideal state of equilibrium of the “idea-forces”: todetermine, that is, the ultimate degree of obscuration suffered by any twoideas of different strength, and the conditions of their permanentcombination or fusion. A mechanics of the mind will, on the contrary, dealwith the rate at which these processes are brought about, the velocitywith which in the movement of mind ideas are obscured or reawakened, &c."|FALSE
39064|"It is fortunately unnecessary, here, to go further into details. WhatHerbart proposes is not a method for the mathematical measurement ofpsychic facts: it is a theory of mechanics and statics specially adaptedto the peculiarities of psychical phenomena, where the forces are givenwith no sine or cosine, where instead of gravitation we have the constanteffort (as it were elasticity) of each idea to revert to its uncheckedstate. He claims—in short—practically to be a Kepler and Newton of themind, and in so doing to justify the vague professions of more than onewriter on mind—above all, perhaps of David Hume, who goes beyond mereprofessions—to make mental science follow the example of physics. And amain argument in favour of his enterprise is the declaration of Kant thatno body of knowledge can claim to be a science except in such proportionas it is mathematical. And the peculiarity of this enterprise is thatself-consciousness, the Ego, is not allowed to interfere with the freeplay of psychic forces. The Ego is—psychologically—the result, theproduct, and the varying product of that play. The play of forces is nodoubt a unity: but its unity lies not in the synthesis of consciousness,but in the essential unity of Soul. And Soul is in its essence neitherconsciousness, nor self-consciousness, nor mind: but something on thebasis of whose unity these are built up and developed(33). The mere“representation” does not include the further supervenience ofconsciousness: it represents, but it is not as yet necessary that weshould also be conscious that there is representation. It is, in thephrase of Leibniz, perception: but not apperception. It is merestraight-out, not as yet reflected, representation. Gradually thereemerges through the operation of mechanical psychics a nucleus, a floatingunity, a fixed or definite central aggregate."|FALSE
39064|"The suggestion of mathematical method has been taken up by subsequentinquirers (as it was pursued even before Herbart’s time), but not in thesense he meant. Experimentation has now taken a prominent place inpsychology. But in proportion as it has done so, psychology has lost itsnative character, and thrown itself into the arms of physiology. WhatHerbart calculated were actions and reactions of idea-forces: what themodern experimental school proposes to measure are to a large extent thevelocities of certain physiological processes, the numerical specificationof certain facts. Such ascertainments are unquestionably useful; asnumerical precision is in other departments. But, taken in themselves,they do not carry us one bit further on the way to science. Asexperiments, further,—to note a point discussed elsewhere(34)—their valuedepends on the point of view, on the theory which has led to them, on thevalue of the general scheme for which they are intended to provide aspecial new determination. In many cases they serve to give a vividreality to what was veiled under a general phrase. The truth looks so muchmore real when it is put in figures: as the size of a huge tree when setagainst a rock; or as when Milton bodies out his fallen angel by settingforth the ratio between his spear and the tallest Norway pine. But untilthe general relationship between soul and body is more clearly formulated,such statistics will have but a value of curiosity."|FALSE

39064|"What Herbart (as well as Hegel) finds perpetual ground for objecting to isthe talk about mental faculties. This objection is part of a generalcharacteristic of all the higher philosophy; and the recurrence of itgives an illustration of how hard it is for any class of men to seethemselves as others see them. If there be anything the vulgar believe tobe true of philosophy, it is that it deals in distant and abstrusegeneralities, that it neglects the shades of individuality and reality,and launches out into unsubstantial general ideas. But it would be easy togather from the great thinkers an anthology of passages in which they holdit forth as the great work of philosophy to rescue our conceptions fromthe indefiniteness and generality of popular conception, and to give themreal, as opposed to a merely nominal, individuality."|FALSE
39064|"The Wolffian school, which Herbart (not less than Kant) found inpossession of the field, and which in Germany may be taken to representonly a slight variant of the half-and-half attitude of vulgar thought, wasentrenched in the psychology of faculties. Empirical psychology, saidWolff(35), tells the number and character of the soul’s faculties:rational psychology will tell what they “properly” are, and how theysubsist in soul. It is assumed that there are general receptacles ortendencies of mental operation which in course of time get filled orqualified in a certain way: and that when this question is disposed of, itstill remains to fix on the metaphysical bases of these facts."|FALSE
39064|"That a doctrine of faculties should fix itself in psychology is not sowonderful. In the non-psychical world objects are easily discriminated inspace, and the individual thing lasts through a time. But a phase of mindis as such fleeting and indeterminate: its individual features which comefrom its “object” tend soon to vanish in memory: all freshness of definitecharacters wears off, and there is left behind only a vague “recept” ofthe one and same in many, a sort of hypostatised representative, faint butpersistent, of what in experience was an ever-varying succession. Wegeneralise here as elsewhere: but elsewhere the many singulars remain toconfront us more effectually. But in Mind the immense variety of realimagination, memory, judgment is forgotten, and the name in each casereduced to a meagre abstract. Thus the identity in character andoperation, having been cut off from the changing elements in its realaction, is transmuted into a substantial somewhat, a subsistent faculty.The relationship of one to another of the powers thus by abstraction andfancy created becomes a problem of considerable moment, their causalrelations in particular: till in the end they stand outside andindependent of each other, engaged, as Herbart says, in a veritable_bellum omnium contra omnes_."|FALSE
39064|"But this hypostatising of faculties becomes a source of still furtherdifficulties when it is taken in connexion with the hypostasis of the Soulor Self or Ego. To Aristotle the Soul in its general aspect is Energy orEssence; and its individual phases are energies. But in the hands of theuntrained these conceptions came to be considerably displaced. Essence orSubstance came to be understood (as may be seen in Locke, and still morein loose talk) as a something,—a substratum,—or peculiar nature—(of which_in itself_ nothing further could be said(36) but which notwithstandingwas permanent and perhaps imperishable): this something subsistentexhibited certain properties or activities. There thus arose, on one hand,the Soul-thing,—a substance misunderstood and sensualised with asupernatural sensuousness,—a denizen of the transcendental or even of thetranscendent world: and, on the other hand, stood the actualmanifestations, the several exhibitions of this force, the assignable anddescribable psychic facts. We are accordingly brought before the problemof how this one substance or essence stands to the several entities orhypostases known as faculties. And we still have in the rear the furtherproblem of how these abstract entities stand to the real and concretesingle acts and states of soul and mind."|FALSE
39064|"This hypostatising of faculties, and this distinction of the “Substantial”soul from its “accidentia” or phenomena, had grown—through thematerialistic proclivities of popular conception—from the indicationsfound in Aristotle. It attained its climax, perhaps in the Wolffian schoolin Germany, but it has been the resort of superficial psychology in allages. For while it, on one hand, seemed to save the substantial Soul onwhose incorruptibility great issues were believed to hinge, it held out,on the other, an open hand to the experimental inquirer, whom it badefreely to search amongst the phenomena. But if it was the refuge ofpusillanimity, it was also the perpetual object of censure from all thegreater and bolder spirits. Thus, the psychology of Hobbes may be hastyand crude, but it is at least animated by a belief that the mental life iscontinuous, and not cut off by abrupt divisions severing the mentalfaculties. The “image” (according to his materialistically colouredpsychology) which, when it is a strong motion, is called sense, passes, asit becomes weaker or decays, into imagination, and gives rise, by itsvarious complications and associations with others, to reminiscence,experience, expectation. Similarly, the voluntary motion which is aneffect or a phase of imagination, beginning at first in smallmotions—called by themselves “endeavours,” and in relation to their cause“appetites” or “desires(37)”—leads on cumulatively to Will, which is the“last appetite in deliberating.” Spinoza, his contemporary, speaks in thesame strain(38). “Faculties of intellect, desire, love, &c., are eitherutterly fictitious, or nothing but metaphysical entities, or universalswhich we are in the habit of forming from particulars. Will and intellectare thus supposed to stand to this or that idea, this or that volition, inthe same way as stoniness to this or that stone, or as man to Peter orPaul.” They are supposed to be a general something which gets defined anddetached. But, in the mind, or in the cogitant soul, there are no suchthings. There are only ideas: and by an “idea” we are to understand not animage on the retina or in the brain, not a “dumb something, like apainting on a panel(39),” but a mode of thinking, or even the act ofintellection itself. The ideas _are_ the mind: mind does not _have_ ideas.Further, every “idea,” as such, “involves affirmation or negation,”—is notan image, but an act of judgment—contains, as we should say, an implicitreference to actuality,—a reference which in volition is made explicit.Thus (concludes the corollary of Eth. ii. 49) “Will and Intellect are oneand the same.” But in any case the “faculties” as such are no better than_entia rationis_ (i.e. auxiliary modes of representing facts)."|FALSE
39064|"Leibniz speaks no less distinctly and sanely in this direction. “Truepowers are never mere possibilities: they are always tendency and action.”The “Monad”—that is the quasi-intelligent unit of existence,—isessentially activity, and its actions are perceptions and appetitions,i.e. tendencies to pass from one perceptive state or act to another. It isout of the variety, the complication, and relations of these miniature orlittle perceptions and appetitions, that the conspicuous phenomena ofconsciousness are to be explained, and not by supposing them due to one orother faculty. The soul is a unity, a self-developing unity, a unity whichat each stage of its existence shows itself in a perception or idea,—eachsuch perception however being, to repeat the oft quoted phrase, _plein del’avenir et chargé du passé_:—each, in other words, is not stationary, butactive and urgent, a progressive force, as well as a representativeelement. Above all, Leibniz has the view that the soul gives rise to allits ideas from itself: that its life is its own production, not a mereinheritance of ideas which it has from birth and nature, nor a mereimportation into an empty room from without, but a necessary result of itsown constitution acting in necessary (predetermined) reciprocity andharmony with the rest of the universe."|FALSE
39064|"But Hobbes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, were most attentively heard in thepassages where they favoured or combatted the dominant social andtheological prepossessions. Their glimpses of truer insight and even theirpalpable contributions in the line of a true psychology were ignored orforgotten. More attention, perhaps, was attracted by an attempt of a verydifferent style. This was the system of Condillac, who, as Hegel says (p.61), made an unmistakable attempt to show the necessary interconnexion ofthe several modes of mental activity. In his _Traité des Sensations_(1754), following on his _Essai sur l’origine des connaissances humaines_(1746), he tried to carry out systematically the deduction or derivationof all our ideas from sense, or to trace the filiation of all ourfaculties from sensation. Given a mind with no other power thansensibility, the problem is to show how it acquires all its otherfaculties. Let us then suppose a sentient animal to which is offered asingle sensation, or one sensation standing out above the others. In suchcircumstances the sensation “becomes” (_devient_) attention: or asensation “is” (_est_) attention, either because it is alone, or becauseit is more lively than all the rest. Again: before such a being, let usset two sensations: to perceive or feel (_apercevoir ou sentir_) the twosensations is the same thing (_c’est la même chose_). If one of thesensations is not present, but a sensation made already, then to perceiveit is memory. Memory, then, is only “transformed sensation” (_sensationtransformée_). Further, suppose we attend to both ideas, this is “the samething” as to compare them. And to compare them we must see difference orresemblance. This is judgment. “Thus sensation becomes successivelyattention, comparison, judgment.” And—by further steps of the equatingprocess—it appears that sensation again “becomes” an act of reflection.And the same may be said of imagination and reasoning: all are transformedsensations."|FALSE
39064|"If this is so with the intelligence, it is equally the case with the Will.To feel and not feel well or ill is impossible. Coupling then this feelingof pleasure or pain with the sensation and its transformations, we get theseries of phases ranging from desire, to passion, hope, will. “Desire isonly the action of the same faculties as are attributed to theunderstanding.” A lively desire is a passion: a desire, accompanied with abelief that nothing stands in its way, is a volition. But combine theseaffective with the intellectual processes already noticed, and you havethinking (_penser_)(40). Thus thought in its entirety is, only and always,transformed sensation."|FALSE

But otherwise such analyses are useful as aids against thetendency of inert thought to take every name in this department as adistinguishable reality: the tendency to part will from thought—ideas fromemotion—and even imagination from reason, as if either could be what itprofessed without the other."|FALSE

39064|"The difficulties of modern psychology perhaps lie in other directions, butthey are not less worth guarding against. They proceed mainly from failureor inability to grasp the central problem of psychology, and a dispositionto let the pen (if it be a book on the subject) wander freely through thealmost illimitable range of instance, illustration, and application.Though it is true that the proper study of mankind is man, it is hardlypossible to say what might not be brought under this head. _Homo sum,nihil a me alienum puto_, it might be urged. Placed in a sort of middleground between physiology (summing up all the results of physical science)and general history (including the contributions of all the branches ofsociology), the psychologist need not want for material. He can wanderinto ethics, aesthetic, and logic, into epistemology and metaphysics. Andit cannot be said with any conviction that he is actually trespassing, solong as the ground remains so ill-fenced and vaguely enclosed. A desultorycollection of observations on traits of character, anecdotes of mentalevents, mixed up with hypothetical descriptions of how a normal humanbeing may be supposed to develop his so-called faculties, and includingsome dictionary-like verbal distinctions, may make a not uninteresting andpossibly bulky work entitled Psychology."|FALSE
39064|"It is partly a desire of keeping up to date which is responsible for thecopious extracts or abstracts from treatises on the anatomy and functionsof the nerve-system, which, accompanied perhaps by a diagram of the brain,often form the opening chapter of a work on psychology. Even if theseresearches had achieved a larger number of authenticated results than theyas yet have, they would only form an appendix and an illustration to theproper subject(42). As they stand, and so long as they remain largelyhypothetical, the use of them in psychology only fosters the commondelusion that, when we can picture out in material outlines a theoryotherwise unsupported, it has gained some further witness in its favour.It is quite arguable indeed that it may be useful to cut out a sectionfrom general human biology which should include the parts of it that werespecially interesting in connexion with the expression or generation ofthought, emotion, and desire. But in that case, there is a blunder insingling out the brain alone, and especially the organs of sense andvoluntary motion,—except for the reason that this province ofpsycho-physics alone has been fairly mapped out. The preponderant half ofthe soul’s life is linked to other parts of the physical system. Emotionand volition, and the general tone of the train of ideas, if they are tobe connected with their expression and physical accompaniment (or aspect),would require a sketch of the heart and lungs, as well as the digestivesystem in general. Nor these alone. Nerve analysis (especially confined tothe larger system), though most modern, is not alone important, as Platoand Aristotle well saw. So that if biology is to be adapted forpsychological use (and if psychology deals with more than cognitiveprocesses), a liberal amount of physiological information seems required."|FALSE
39064|"Experimental psychology is a term used with a considerable laxity ofcontent; and so too is that of physiological psychology, orpsycho-physics. And the laxity mainly arises because there is anuncertainty as to what is principal and what secondary in the inquiry.Experiment is obviously a help to observation: and so far as the latter ispracticable, the former would seem to have a chance of introduction. Butin any case, experiment is only a means to an end and only practicableunder the guidance of hypothesis and theory. Its main value would be incase the sphere of psychology were completely paralleled with one provinceof physiology. It was long ago maintained by Spinoza and (in a way by)Leibniz, that there is no mental phenomenon without its bodily equivalent,pendant, or correspondent. The _ordo rerum_ (the molecular system ofmovements) is, he held, the same as the order of ideas. But it is only atintervals, under special conditions, or when they reach a certainmagnitude, that ideas emerge into full consciousness. As consciousnesspresents them, they are often discontinuous, and abrupt: and they do notalways carry with them their own explanation. Hence if we are confined tothe larger phenomena of consciousness alone, our science is imperfect:many things seem anomalous; above all, perhaps, will, attention, and thelike. We have seen how Herbart (partly following the hints of Leibniz),attempted to get over this difficulty by the hypothesis of idea-forceswhich generate the forms and matter of consciousness by their mutualimpact and resistance. Physiological psychology substitutes for Herbart’sreals and his idea-forces a more materialistic sort of reality; perhapsfunctions of nerve-cells, or other analogous entities. There, it hopes oneday to discover the underlying continuity of event which in the upperrange of consciousness is often obscured, and then the process would be,as the phrase goes, explained: we should be able to picture it out withouta gap."|FALSE

They will be valid against themode of thought which, when Psyché fails us for an explanation, turns tobody, and interpolates soul between the states of body: the mode which, inan older phraseology, jumps from final causes to physical, and fromphysical (or efficient) to final. Here, as elsewhere, the physical has itsplace: and here, more than in many places, the physical has been unfairlytreated.

It piles up numbers and numbers,and fails to ask whether the results so formed have any theoretical valuewhatever: it seeks answers before a question has been clearly anddistinctly framed; whereas the value of experimental answers alwaysdepends on the exactitude with which the question is put. Let me remindthe reader, how one inquirer after another made many thousand experimentson the estimation of small intervals of time, without a single one of themraising the question what the precise point was which these experimentssought to measure, what was the psychological occurrence in the case, orwhat psychological phenomena were employed as the standard oftime-intervals.

For physiological, or what istechnically called psychological, experiment, is co-ordinate with manyother sources of information. Much, for instance, is to be learnt by acareful study of language by those who combine sound linguistic knowledgewith psychological training. It is in language, spoken and written, thatwe find at once the great instrument and the great document of thedistinctively human progress from a mere _Psyche_ to a mature _Nous_, fromSoul to Mind. Whether we look at the varieties of its structure underdifferent ethnological influences, or at the stages of its growth in anation and an individual, we get light from language on thedifferentiation and consolidation of ideas.

39064|"“The human being of the psychologist,” says Herbart(45), “is the socialand civilised human being who stands on the apex of the whole historythrough which his race has passed. In him is found visibly together allthe multiplicity of elements, which, under the name of mental faculties,are regarded as a universal inheritance of humanity. Whether they areoriginally in conjunction, whether they are originally a multiplicity, isa point on which the facts are silent. The savage and the new-born childgive us far less occasion to admire the range of their mind than do thenobler animals. But the psychologists get out of this difficulty by theunwarranted assumption that all the higher mental activities existpotentially in children and savages—though not in the animals—as arudimentary predisposition or psychical endowment. Of such a nascentintellect, a nascent reason, and nascent moral sense, they findrecognisable traces in the scanty similarities which the behaviour ofchild or savage offers to those of civilised man. We cannot fail to notethat in their descriptions they have before them a special state of man,and one which, far from accurately defined, merely follows the generalimpression made upon us by those beings we name civilised. An extremelyfluctuating character inevitably marks this total impression. For thereare no general facts:—the genuine psychological documents lie in themomentary states of individuals: and there is an immeasurably long wayfrom these to the height of the universal concept of man in general.”"|FALSE
39064|"And yet Man in general,—Man as man and therefore as mind—the concept ofMan—normal and ideal man—the complete and adequate Idea of man—is the trueterminus of the psychological process; and whatever be the difficulties inthe way, it is the only proper goal of the science. Only it has to bebuilt up, constructed, evolved, developed,—and not assumed as a datum ofpopular imagination. We want a concept, concrete and real, of Man and ofMind, which shall give its proper place to each of the elements that, inthe several examples open to detailed observation, are presented withunfair or exaggerated prominence. The savage and the child are not to beleft out as free from contributing to form the ideal: virtues here are notmore important than vices, and are certainly not likely to be soinforming: even the insane and the idiot show us what human intelligenceis and requires: and the animals are also within the sweep of psychology.Man is not its theatre to the exclusion of woman; if it records theresults of introspection of the Me, it will find vast and copious quarriesin the various modes in which an individual identifies himself with othersas We. And even the social and civilised man gets his designation, asusual, _a potiori_. He is more civilised and social than others: perhapsrather more civilised than not. But always, in some measure, he is at thesame time unsocial or anti-social, and uncivilised. Each unit in thesociety of civilisation has to the outside observer—and sometimes even tohis own self-detached and impartial survey—a certain oddity or fixity, agleam of irrationality, which shows him to fall short of complete sanityor limpid and mobile intelligence. He has not wholly put off thesavage,—least of all, says the cynic, in his relations with the other sex.He carries with him even to the grave some grains of the recklessness andpetulance of childhood. And rarely, if ever, can it be said of him that hehas completely let the ape and tiger die."|FALSE
39064|"But that is only one way of looking at the matter—and one which, perhaps,is more becoming to the pathologist and the cynic, than to thepsychologist. Each of these stages of psychical development, even if thatdevelopment be obviously describable as degeneration, has something which,duly adjusted, has its place and function in the theory of thenormally-complete human mind. The animal, the savage, and the child,—eachhas its part there. It is a mutilated, one-sided and superficial advancein socialisation which cuts off the civilised creature from the naturalstem of his ancestry, from the large freedom, the immense _insouciance_,the childlikeness of his first estate. There is something, again, wantingin the man who utterly lacks the individualising realism and tenderness ofthe woman, as in the woman who can show no comprehension of view orbravery of enterprise. Even pathological states of mind are not mereanomalies and mere degenerations. Nature perhaps knows no properdegenerations, but only by-ways and intricacies in the course ofdevelopment. Still less is the vast enormity or irregularity of genius tobe ignored. It is all—to the philosophic mind—a question of degree andproportion,—though often the proportion seems to exceed the scale of ourcustomary denominators. If an element is latent or quiescent (in arrest),that is no index to its absolute amount: “we know not what’s resisted.”Let us by all means keep proudly to our happy mediocrity of faculty, andstep clear of insanity or idiotcy on one hand, and from genius or heroismon the other. But the careful observer will notwithstanding note howdelicately graded and how intricately combined are the steps which connectextremes so terribly disparate. It is only vulgar ignorance which turnsaway in hostility or contempt from the imbecile and the deranged, and onlya worse than vulgar sciolism which sees in genius and the hero nothing butan aberration from its much-prized average. Criminalistic anthropology, orthe psychology of the criminal, may have indulged in much franticexaggeration as to the doom which nature and heredity have pronounced overthe fruit of the womb even before it entered the shores of light: yet theyhave at least served to discredit the free and easy assumption of theabstract averagist, and shown how little the penalties of an unbending lawmeet the requirements of social well-being."|FALSE

The happy mean between making too muchof palpable differences and hurrying on to a similar rendering of similarsigns is the rarest of gifts. Or, perhaps, it were truer to say it is thelatest and most hardly won of acquirements. To learn to observe—observewith mind—is not a small thing. There are rules for it—both rules ofgeneral scope and, above all, rules in each special department. But likeall “major premisses” in practice, everything depends on the power ofjudgment, the tact, the skill, the “gift” of applying them.

Every single instance,individualised and historical,—unless it be exhibited by that true art ofgenius which we cannot expect in the average psychologist—narrows, eventhough it be but slightly, the complete and all-sided truth. Anecdotes aregood, and to the wise they convey a world of meaning, but to lesser mindsthey sometimes suggest anything but the points they should accentuate.Without the detail of individual realistic study there is no psychologyworth the name. History, story, we must have: but at the same time, withthe philosopher, we must say, I don’t give much weight to stories. Andthis is what will always—except in rare instances where something likegenius is conjoined with it—make esoteric science hard and unpopular. Itdare not—if it is true to its idea—rest on any amount of mere instances,as isolated, unreduced facts. Yet it can only have real power so far as itconcentrates into itself the life-blood of many instances, and indeedextracts the pith and unity of all instances."|FALSE
39064|"Nor, on the other hand, can it turn itself too directly and intentlytowards practical applications. All this theory of mental progress fromthe animate soul to the fullness of religion and science deals solely withthe universal process of education: “the education of humanity” we maycall it: the way in which mind is made true and real(46). It is thereforea question of intricacy and of time how to carry over this general theoryinto the arena of education as artificially directed and planned. To tryto do so at a single step would be to repeat the mistake of Plato, ifPlato may be taken to suppose (which seems incredible) that a theoreticalstudy of the dialectics of truth and goodness would enable his rulers,without the training of special experience, to undertake the supreme tasksof legislation or administration. All politics, like all education, restson these principles of the means and conditions of mental growth: but theschooling of concrete life, though it may not develop the faculty offormulating general laws, will often train better for the management ofthe relative than a mere logical Scholastic in first or absoluteprinciples."|FALSE
39064|"In conclusion, there are one or two points which seem of cardinalimportance for the progress of psychology. (1) Its difference from thephysical sciences has to be set out: in other words, the peculiarity ofpsychical fact. It will not do merely to say that experience marks outthese boundaries with sufficient clearness. On the contrary, the termsconsciousness, feeling, mind, &c., are evidently to many psychologistsmere names. In particular, the habits of physical research when introducedinto mental study lead to a good deal of what can only be calledmythology. (2) There should be a clearer recognition of the problem of therelations of mental unity to mental elements. But to get that, a morethorough logical and metaphysical preparation is needed than is usuallysupposed necessary. The doctrine of identity and necessity, of universaland individual, has to be faced, however tedious. (3) The distinctionbetween first-grade and second-grade elements and factors in the mentallife has to be realised. The mere idea as presentative or immediate has tobe kept clear of the more logico-reflective, or normative ideas, whichbelong to judgment and reasoning. And the number of these grades in mentaldevelopment seems endless. (4) But, also, a separation is required—were itbut temporary—between what may be called principles, and what is detail.At present, in psychology, “principles” is a word almost without meaning.A complete all-explaining system is of course impossible at present andmay always be so. Yet if an effort of thought could be concentrated oncardinal issues, and less padding of conventional and traditional detailwere foisted in, much might thereby be done to make detailed researchfruitful. (5) And finally, perhaps, if psychology be a philosophicalstudy, some hint as to its purpose and problem would be desirable. If itis only an abstract branch of science, of course, no such hint is inplace."|FALSE
39064|"Essay III. On Some Psychological Aspects Of Ethics."|FALSE
39064|"Allusion has already been made to the question of the boundaries betweenlogic and psychology, between logic and ethics, ethics and psychology, andpsychology and epistemology. Each of these occasionally comes to coverground that seems more appropriate to the others. Logic is sometimesrestricted to denote the study of the conditions of derivative knowledge,of the canons of inference and the modes of proof. If taken more widely asthe science of thought-form, it is supposed to imply a world of fixed orstereotyped relations between ideas, a system of stable thoughts governedby inflexible laws in an absolute order of immemorial or eternal truth. Asagainst such fixity, psychology is supposed to deal with these same ideasas products—as growing out of a living process of thought—having a historybehind them and perhaps a prospect of further change. The genesis so givenmay be either a mere chronicle-history, or it may be a philosophicaldevelopment. In the former case, it would note the occasions of incidentand circumstance, the reactions of mind and environment, under which theideas were formed. Such a psychological genesis of several ideas is foundin the Second Book of Locke’s Essay. In the latter case, the account wouldbe more concerned with the inner movement, the action and reaction inideas themselves, considered not as due to casual occurrences, but asself-developing by an organic growth. But in either case, ideas would beshown not to be ready-made and independently existing kinds in a world ofidea-things, and not to form an unchanging diagram or framework, but to bea growth, to have a history, and a development. Psychology in this sensewould be a dynamical, as opposed to the supposed statical, treatment ofideas and concepts in logic. But it may be doubted how far it is well tocall this psychology: unless psychology deals with the contents of themental life, in their meaning and purpose, instead of, as seems proper,merely in their character of psychic events. Such psychology is rather anevolutionist logic,—a dialectic process more than an analytic of a datum."|FALSE
39064|"In the same way, ethics may be brought into one kind of contact withpsychology. Ethics, like logic, may be supposed to presuppose and to dealwith a certain inflexible scheme of requirements, a world of moral ordergoverned by invariable or universal law; an eternal kingdom of right,existing independently of human wills, but to be learned and followed outin uncompromising obedience. As against this supposed absolute order,psychology may be said to show the genesis of the idea of obligation andduty, the growth of the authority of conscience, the formation of ideals,the relativity of moral ideas. Here also it may reach this conclusion, bya more external or a more internal mode of argument. It may try to show,in other words, that circumstances give rise to these forms of estimatingconduct, or it may argue that they are a necessary development in thehuman being, constituted as he is. It may again be doubted whether this isproperly called psychology. Yet its purport seems ultimately to be thatthe objective order is misconceived when it is regarded as an external orquasi-physical order: as a law written up and sanctioned with an externalauthority—as, in Kant’s words, a heteronomy. If that order is objective,it is so because it is also in a sense subjective: if it is above the mereindividuality of the individual, it is still in a way identical with histrue or universal self-hood. Thus “psychological” here means therecognition that the logical and the moral law is an autonomy: that it isnot given, but though necessary, necessary by the inward movement of themind. The metaphor of law is, in brief, misleading. For, according to acommon, though probably an erroneous, analysis of that term, the essenceof a law in the political sphere is to be a species of command. And thatis rather a one-sidedly practical or aesthetic way of looking at it. Theessence of law in general, and the precondition of every law in special,is rather uniformity and universality, self-consistency and absence ofcontradiction: or, in other words, rationality. Its essential opposite—orits contradiction in essence—is a privilege, an attempt at isolating acase from others. It need not indeed always require bareuniformity—require i.e. the same act to be done by different people: butit must always require that every thing within its operation shall betreated on principles of utter and thorough harmony and consistency. Itrequires each thing to be treated on public principles and with publicity:nothing apart and mere singular, as a mere incident or as a world byitself. Differently it may be treated, but always on grounds of commonwell-being, as part of an embracing system."|FALSE
39064|"There is probably another sense, however, in which psychology comes intoclose relation with ethics. If we look on man as a microcosm, his innersystem will more or less reproduce the system of the larger world. Theolder psychology used to distinguish an upper or superior order offaculties from a lower or inferior. Thus in the intellectual sphere, theintellect, judgment, and reason were set above the senses, imagination,and memory. Among the active powers, reasonable will, practical reason andconscience were ranked as paramount over the appetites and desires andemotions. And this use of the word “faculty” is as old as Plato, whoregards science as a superior faculty to opinion or imagination. But thisapplication—which seems a perfectly legitimate one—does not, in the firstinstance, belong to psychology at all. No doubt it is psychicallypresented: but it has an other source. It springs from an appreciation, ajudgment of the comparative truth or reality of what the so-calledpsychical act means or expresses. Such faculties are powers in a hierarchyof means and ends and presuppose a normative or critical function whichhas classified reality. Psychically, the elements which enter intoknowledge are not other than those which belong to opinion: but they arenearer an adequate rendering of reality, they are truer, or nearer theIdea. And in the main we may say, that is truer or more real whichsucceeds in more completely organising and unifying elements—which risesmore and more above the selfish or isolated part into the thorough unityof all parts."|FALSE
39064|"The superior faculty is therefore the more thorough organisation of thatwhich is elsewhere less harmoniously systematised. Opinion is fragmentaryand partial: it begins abruptly and casually from the unknown, and runsoff no less abruptly into the unknown. Knowledge, on the contrary, isunified: and its unity gives it its strength and superiority. The powerswhich thus exist are the subjective counterparts of objectively valuableproducts. Thus, reason is the subjective counterpart of a world in whichall the constituents are harmonised and fall into due relationship. It isa product or result, which is not psychologically, but logically ormorally important. It is a faculty, because it means that actually itspossessor has ordered and systematised his life or his ideas of things.Psychologically, it, like unreason, is a compound of elements: but in thecase of reason the composition is unendingly and infinitely consistent; itis knowledge completely unified. The distinction then is not in thestrictest sense psychological: for it has an aesthetic or normativecharacter; it is logical or ethical: it denotes that the idea or the actis an approach to truth or goodness. And so, when Butler or Platodistinguishes reason or reflection from appetites and affections, and evenfrom self-love or from the heart which loves and hates, this is notexactly a psychological division in the narrower sense. That is to say:these are, in Plato’s words, not merely “parts,” but quite as much “kinds”and “forms” of soul. They denote degrees in that harmonisation of mind andsoul which reproduces the permanent and complete truth of things. Forexample, self-love, as Butler describes it, has but a partial and narrowedview of the worth of acts: it is engrossing and self-involved: it cannottake in the full dependence of the narrower interest on the larger andeternal self. So, in Plato, the man of heart is but a nature which by fitsand starts, or with steady but limited vision, realises the larger life.These parts or kinds are not separate and co-existent faculties: butgrades in the co-ordination and unification of the same one human nature."|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Psychology and Epistemology."|FALSE
39064|"Psychology however in the strict sense is extremely difficult to define.Those who describe it as the “science of mind,” the “phenomenology ofconsciousness,” seem to give it a wider scope than they really mean. Thepsychologist of the straiter sect tends, on the other hand, to carry usbeyond mind and consciousness altogether. His, it has been said, is apsychology without a Psyché. For him Mind, Soul, and Consciousness areonly current and convenient names to designate the field, the ground onwhich the phenomena he observes are supposed to transact themselves. Butthey must not on any account interfere with the operations; any more thanNature in general may interfere with strictly physical inquiries, or Lifeand vital force with the theories of biology. The so-called Mind is onlyto be regarded as a stage on which certain events represent themselves. Inthis field, or on this stage, there are certain relatively ultimateelements, variously called ideas, presentations, feelings, or states ofconsciousness. But these elements, though called ideas, must not besupposed more than mechanical or dynamical elements; consciousness israther their product, a product which presupposes certain operations andrelations between them. If we are to be strictly scientific, we must, itis urged, treat the factors of consciousness as not themselves conscious:we must regard them as quasi-objective, or in abstraction from theconsciousness which surveys them. The Ego must sink into a mere receptacleor arena of psychic event; its independent meaning or purport is to beignored, as beside the question."|FALSE
39064|"When this line is once fixed upon, it seems inevitable to go farther.Comte was inclined to treat psychology as falling between two stools: itmust, he thought, draw all its content either from physiology on the onehand, or from social factors on the other. The dominant or experimentalpsychology of the present day seems inclined, without however formulatingany very definite statement, to pronounce for the former alternative. Itdoes not indeed adopt the materialistic view that mind is only a functionof matter. Its standpoint rather is that the psychical presents itselfeven to unskilled observation as dependent on (i.e. not independent of) oras concomitant with certain physical or corporeal facts. It adds that themore accurately trained the observer becomes, the more he comes todiscover a corporeal aspect even where originally he had not surmised itsexistence, and to conclude that the two cycles of psychical and physicalevent never interfere with each other: that soul does not intervene inbodily process, nor body take up and carry on psychical. If it is saidthat the will moves the limbs, he replies that the will which moves isreally certain formerly unnoticed movements of nerve and muscle which arefelt or interpreted as a discharge of power. If the ocular impression issaid to cause an impression on the mind, he replies that any fact hiddenunder that phrase refers to a change in the molecules of the brain. Hewill therefore conclude that for the study of psychical phenomena thephysical basis, as it may be called, is all important. Only so canobservation really deal with fact capable of description and measurement.Thus psychology, it may be said, tends to become a department ofphysiology. From another standpoint, biology may be said to receive itscompletion in psychology. How much either phrase means, however, willdepend on the estimate we form of biology. If biology is only the study ofmechanical and chemical phenomena on the peculiar field known as anorganism, and if that organism is only treated as an environment which maybe ignored, then psychology, put on the same level, is not the fullscience of mind, any more than the other is the full study of life. Theyboth have narrowed their subject to suit the abstract scheme of thelaboratory, where the victim of experiment is either altered by mutilationand artificial restrictions, or is dead. If, on the contrary, biology hasa substantial unity of its own to which mechanical and chemicalconsiderations are subordinate and instrumental, psychology may even takepart with physiology without losing its essential rank. But in that case,we must, as Spinoza said(47), think less mechanically of the animal frame,and recognise (after the example of Schelling) something truly inward(i.e. not merely locally inside the skin) as the supreme phase orcharacteristic of life. We must, in short, recognise sensibility as theculmination of the physiological and the beginning of the psychological."|FALSE
39064|"To the strictly scientific psychologist, as has been noted—or to thepsychology which imitates optical and electrical science—ideas are onlypsychical events: they are not ideas _of_ anything, relative, i.e. tosomething else; they have no meaning, and no reference to a reality beyondthemselves. They are presentations;—not representations of somethingoutside consciousness. They are appearances: but not appearances ofsomething: they do not reveal anything beyond themselves. They are, we mayalmost say, a unique kind of physical phenomena. If we say they arepresentations of something, we only mean that in the presented something,in the felt something, the wished something, we separate the quality orform or aspect of presentativeness, of feltness, of wishedness, andconsider this aspect by itself. There are grades, relations,complications, of such presentations or in such presentedness: and withthe description and explanation of these, psychology is concerned. Theyare fainter or stronger, more or less correlated and antithetical.Presentation (or ideation), in short, is the name of a train of event,which has its peculiarities, its laws, its systems, its history."|FALSE
39064|"All reality, it may be said, subsists in such presentation; it is for aconsciousness, or in a consciousness. All _esse_, in its widest sense, is_percipi_. And yet, it seems but the commonest of experiences to say thatall that is presented is not reality. It _is_, it has a sort of being,—issomehow presumed to exist: but it is not reality. And this reference andantithesis to _what_ is presented is implied in all such terms as “ideas,”“feelings,” “states of consciousness”: they are distinguished from andrelated to objects of sense or external facts, to something, as it iscalled, outside consciousness. Thoughts and ideas are set against thingsand realities. In their primitive stage both the child and the savage seemto recognise no such difference. What they imagine is, as we might say, onthe same plane with what they touch and feel. They do not, as wereproachfully remark, recognise the difference between fact and fiction.All of us indeed are liable to lapses into the same condition. A strongpassion, a keen hope or fear, as we say, invests its objects with reality:even a sanguine moment presents as fact what calmer reflection disallowsas fancy. With natural and sane intelligences, however, the recrudescenceof barbarous imagination is soon dispelled, and the difference betweenhallucinations and realities is established. With the utterly wrecked inmind, the reality of hallucinations becomes a permanent or habitual state.With the child and the untrained it is a recurrent and a disturbinginfluence: and it need hardly be added that the circle of these _deceptideceptores_—people with the “lie in the Soul”—is a large one. There thusemerges a distinction of vast importance, that of truth and falsehood, ofreality and unreality, or between representation and reality. There arisetwo worlds, the world of ideas, and the world of reality which it issupposed to represent, and, in many cases, to represent badly."|FALSE
39064|"With this distinction we are brought across the problem sometimes calledEpistemological. Strictly speaking, it is really part of a larger problem:the problem of what—if Greek compounds must be used—may be styledAletheiology—the theory of truth and reality: what Hegel called Logic, andwhat many others have called Metaphysics. As it is ordinarily taken up,“ideas” are believed to be something _in us_ which is representative orsymbolical of something truly real _outside us_. This inward something issaid to be the first and immediate object of knowledge(48), and givesus—in a mysterious way we need not here discuss—the mediate knowledge ofthe reality, which is sometimes said to cause it. Ideas in the Mind, or inthe Subject, or in us, bear witness to something outside themind,—trans-subjective—beyond us. The Mind, Subject, or Ego, in thisparallelism is evidently in some way identified with our corporealorganism: perhaps even located, and provided with a “seat,” in somedefined space of that organism. It is, however, the starting-point of thewhole distinction that ideas _do not_, no less than they do, conform orcorrespond to this supra-conscious or extra-conscious world of realthings. Truth or falsehood arises, according to these assumptions,according as psychical image or idea corresponds or not to physical fact.But how, unless by some miraculous second-sight, where the supremeconsciousness, directly contemplating by intuition the true andindependent reality, turns to compare with this immediate vision theresults of the mediate processes conducted along the organs of sense,—howthis agreement or disagreement of copy and original, of idea and reality,can be detected, it is impossible to say."|FALSE
39064|"As has been already noted, the mischief lies in the hypostatisation ofideas as something existing in abstraction from things—and, of things, inabstraction from ideas. They are two abstractions, the first by therealist, the second by the idealist called subjective and psychological.To the realist, things exist by themselves, and they manage to produce acopy of themselves (more or less exact, or symbolical) in _our_ mind, i.e.in a materialistically-spiritual or a spiritualistically-material locuswhich holds “images” and ideas. To the psychological idealist, ideas havea substantive and primary right to existence, them alone do we reallyknow, and from them we more or less legitimately are said (but probably noone takes this seriously) to infer or postulate a world of permanentthings. Now ideas have no substantive existence as a sort of things, oreven images of things anywhere. All this is pure mythology. It is said bycomparative mythologists that in some cases the epithet or quality of somedeity has been substantialised (hypostatised) into a separate god, who,however (so still to keep up the unity), is regarded as a relative, a son,or daughter, of the original. So the phrase “ideas of things” has beentaken literally as if it was double. But to have an idea of a thing merelymeans that we know it, or think it. An idea is not given: it is a thingwhich is given in the idea. An idea is not an additional and interveningobject of our knowledge or supposed knowledge. That a thing is our objectof thought is another word for its being our idea, and that means we knowit."|FALSE
39064|"The distinction between truth and falsehood, between reality andappearance, is not arrived at by comparing what we have before us in ourmind with some inaccessible reality beyond. It is a distinction that growsup with the growth and organisation of our presentations—with theirgradual systematisation and unification in one consciousness. But thisconsciousness which thinks, i.e. judges and reasons, is something superiorto the contrast of physical and psychical: superior, i.e. in so far as itincludes and surveys the antithesis, without superseding it. It is the“transcendental unity of consciousness” of Kant—his synthetic unity ofapperception. It means that all ideas ultimately derive their reality fromtheir coherence with each other in an all-embracing or infinite idea. Realin a sense ideas always are, but with an imperfect reality. Thus theeducation to truth is not—such a thing would be meaningless—ended by arough and ready recommendation to compare our ideas with facts: it mustteach the art which discovers facts. And the teaching may have to gothrough many grades or provinces: in each of which it is possible toacquire a certain virtuosoship without being necessarily an adept inanother. It is through what is called the development of intellect,judgment, and reasoning that the faculty of truth-detecting ortruth-selecting comes. And the common feature of all of these is, so tosay, their superiority to the psychological mechanism, not in the sense ofworking without it and directly, but of being the organising unity orunifier and controller and judge of that mechanism. The certainty andnecessity of truth and knowledge do not come from a constraint from theexternal thing which forces the inner idea into submission; they come fromthe inner necessity of conformity and coherence in the organism ofexperience. We in fact had better speak of ideas as experience—as feltreality: a reality however which has its degrees and perhaps even itsprovinces. All truth comes with the reasoned judgment, i.e. thesyllogism—i.e. with the institution or discovery of relations of fact orelement to fact or element, immediate or derivative, partial and lesspartial, up to its ideal coherence in one Idea. It is because thiscoherence is so imperfectly established in many human beings that theirknowledge is so indistinguishable from opinion, and that they separate soloosely truth from error. They have not worked their way into a definitelyarticulated system, where there are no gaps, no abrupt transitions: theirmental order is so loosely put together that divergences andcontradictions which vex another drop off ineffectual from them."|FALSE
39064|"(ii.) Kant, Fichte, and Hegel."|FALSE
39064|"This was the idealism which Kant taught and Fichte promoted. Of the otheridealism there are no doubt abundant traces in the language of Kant: andthey were greedily fastened on by Schopenhauer. To him the doctrine, thatthe world is my idea, is adequately represented when it is translated intothe phrase that the world is a phantasmagoria of my brain; and escape fromthe subjective idealism thus initiated is found by him only through asupposed revelation of immediate being communicated in the experience ofwill. But according to the more consistently interpreted Kant, the problemof philosophy consists in laying bare the supreme law or conditions ofconsciousness on which depend the validity of our knowledge, our estimatesof conduct, and our aesthetic standards. And these roots of reality arefor Kant in the mind—or, should we rather say—in mind—in “Consciousness inGeneral.” In the _Criticism of Pure Reason_ the general drift of hisexamination is to show that the great things or final realities which arepopularly supposed to stand in self-subsistent being, as ultimate andall-comprehensive objects set up for knowledge, are not “things” aspopularly supposed, but imperative and inevitable ideas. They are notobjects to be known—(these are always finite): but rather the unification,the basis, or condition, and the completion of all knowledge. To knowthem—in the ordinary petty sense of knowledge—is as absurd and impossibleas it would be, in the Platonic scheme of reality, to know the idea ofgood which is “on the further side of knowledge and being.” God and theSoul—and the same would be true of the World (though modern speculatorssometimes talk as if they had it at least within their grasp)—are not mere_objects_ of knowledge. It would be truer to say they are that by which weknow, and they are what in us knows: they make knowledge possible, andactual. Kant has sometimes spoken of them as the objects of a faith ofreason. What he means is that reason only issues in knowledge because ofand through this inevitable law of reason bidding us go on for ever in oursearch, because there can be nothing isolated and nowhere any _ne plusultra_ in science, which is infinite and yet only justified as itpostulates or commands unity."|FALSE
39064|"Kant’s central idea is that truth, beauty, goodness, are not dependent onsome qualities of the object, but on the universal nature or law ofconsciousness. Beauty is not an attribute of things in their abstractness:but of things as ideas of a subject, and depends on the proportion andsymmetry in the play of human faculty. Goodness is not conformity to anoutward law, but is obligatory on us through that higher nature which isour truer being. Truth is not conformity of ideas with supposedtrans-subjective things, but coherence and stability in the system ofideas. The really infinite world is not out there, but in here—inconsciousness in general, which is the denial of all limitation, of allfinality, of all isolation. God is the essential and inherent unity andunifier of spirit and nature—the surety that the world in all itsdifferentiations is one. The Soul is not an essential entity, but theinfinite fruitfulness and freshness of mental life, which forbids usstopping at anything short of complete continuity and unity. The Kingdomof God—the Soul—the moral law—is within us: within us, as supreme,supra-personal and infinite intelligences, even amid all our littlenessand finitude. Even happiness which we stretch our arms after is not reallybeyond us, but is the essential self which indeed we can only reach indetail. It is so both in knowledge and in action. Each knowledge andenjoyment in reality is limited and partial, but it is made stable, and itgets a touch of infinitude, by the larger idea which it helps to realise.Only indeed in that antithesis between the finite and the infinite doesthe real live. Every piece of knowledge is real, only because it assumes_pro tempore_ certain premisses which are given: every actual beauty isset in some defect of aesthetic completeness: every actually good deed hasto get its foil in surrounding badness. The real is always partial andincomplete. But it has the basis or condition of its reality in an idea—ina transcendental unity of consciousness, which is so to say a law, or asystem and an order, which imposes upon it the condition of conformity andcoherence; but a conformity which is essential and implicit in it."|FALSE
39064|"Fichte has called his system a _Wissenschaftslehre_—a theory of knowledge.Modern German used the word _Wissenschaft_, as modern English uses theword Science, to denote the certified knowledge of piecemeal fact, thepartial unification of elements still kept asunder. But by _Wissen_, asopposed to _Erkennen_, is meant the I know, am aware and sure, am incontact with reality, as opposed to the derivative and conditionalreference of something to something else which explains it. The former isa wider term: it denotes all consciousness of objective truth, thecertainty which claims to be necessary and universal, which pledges itswhole self for its assertion. Fichte thus unifies and accentuates thecommon element in the Kantian criticisms. In the first of these Kant hadbegun by explaining the nature and limitation of empirical science. It wasessentially conditioned by the given sensation—dependent i.e. on anunexplained and preliminary element. This is what makes it science in thestrict or narrow sense of the term: its being set, as it were, in theunknown, the felt, the sense-datum. The side of reality is thus the sideof limitation and of presupposition. But what makes it truth and knowledgein general, on the other hand,—as distinct from _a_ truth (i.e. partialtruth) and a knowledge,—is the ideal element—the mathematical, thelogical, the rational law,—or in one word, the universal and formalcharacter. So too every real action is on one hand the product of animpulse, a dark, merely given, immediate tendency to be, and without thatwould be nothing: but on the other hand it is only an intelligent andmoral action in so far as it has its constitution from an intelligence, aformal system, which determine its place and function."|FALSE
39064|"It is on the latter or ideal element that Kant makes the emphasisincreasingly turn. Not truths, duties, beauties, but truth, duty, beauty,form his theme. The formal element—the logical or epistemologicalcondition of knowledge and morality and of beauty—is what he (and stillmore Fichte) considers the prime question of fundamental philosophy. Hisphilosophy is an attempt to get at the organism of our fundamentalbelief—the construction, from the very base, of our conception of reality,of our primary certainty. In technical language, he describes ouressential nature as a Subject-object. It is the unity of an I am which isalso I know that I am: an I will which is also I am conscious of mywill(49). Here there is a radical disunion and a supersession of thatdisunion. Action and contemplation are continually outrunning each other.The I will rests upon one I know, and works up to another: the I knowreflects upon an I will, and includes it as an element in its idea."|FALSE
39064|"Kant had brought into use the term Deduction, and Fichte follows him. Theterm leads to some confusion: for in English, by its modern antithesis toinduction, it suggests _a priori_ methods in all their iniquity. It meansa kind of jugglery which brings an endless series out of one small term.Kant has explained that he uses it in the lawyer’s sense in which a claimis justified by being traced step by step back to some acknowledged andaccepted right(50). It is a regressive method which shows us that if theoriginal datum is to be accepted it carries along with it the legitimationof the consequence. This method Fichte applies to psychology. Begin, hesays like Condillac, with the barest nucleus of soul-life; the meresentiency, or feeling: the contact, as it were, with being, at a singlepoint. But such a mere point is unthinkable. You find, as Mr. Spencersays, that “Thought” (or Consciousness) “cannot be framed out of one termonly.” “Every sensation to be known as one must be perceived.” Such is thenature of the Ego—a subject which insists on each part being qualified bythe whole and so transformed. As Mr. Spencer, again, puts it, the mind notmerely tends to revive, to associate, to assimilate, to represent its ownpresentations, but it carries on this process infinitely and in everhigher multiples. Ideas as it were are growing in complexity byre-presenting: i.e. by embracing and enveloping elements which cannot befound existing in separation. In the mind there is no mere presentation,no bare sensation. Such a unit is a fiction or hypothesis we employ, likethe atom, for purposes of explanation. The pure sensation therefore—whichyou admit because you must have something to begin with, not a merenothing, but something so simple that it seems to stand out clear andindisputable—this pure sensation, when you think of it, forces you to go agood deal further. Even to be itself, it must be more than itself. It islike the pure or mere being of the logicians. Admit the simplesensation—and you have admitted everything which is required to makesensation a possible reality. But you do not—in the sense of vulgarlogic—deduce what follows out of the beginning. From that, taken byitself, you will get only itself: mere being will give you only nothing,to the end of the chapter. But, as the phrase is, sensation is an elementin a consciousness: it is, when you think of it, always more than youcalled it: there is a curious “continuity” about the phenomena, whichmakes real isolation impossible."|FALSE
39064|"Of course this “deduction” is not history: it is logic. It says, if youposit sensation, then in doing so, you posit a good deal more. You haveimagination, reason, and many more, all involved in your originalassumption. And there is a further point to be noted. You cannot reallystop even at reason, at intelligence and will, if you take these in thefull sense. You must realise that these only exist as part and parcel of areasonable world. An individual intelligence presupposes a society ofintelligences. The successive steps in this argument are presented byFichte in the chief works of his earlier period (1794-98). The works ofthat period form a kind of trilogy of philosophy, by which the faintoutlines of the absolute selfhood is shown acquiring definite consistencyin the moral organisation of society. First comes the “Foundation for thecollective philosophy.” It shows how our conception of reality and ourpsychical organisation are inevitably presupposed in the barest functionof intelligence, in the abstractest forms of logical law. Begin where youlike, with the most abstract and formal point of consciousness, you areforced, as you dwell upon it (you identifying yourself with the thoughtyou realise), to go step by step on till you accept as a self-consistentand self-explanatory unity all that your cognitive and volitional natureclaims to own as its birthright. Only in such an intelligent will isperception and sensation possible. Next came the “Foundation of NaturalLaw, on the principles of the general theory.” Here the process ofdeduction is carried a step further. If man is to realise himself as anintelligence with an inherent bent to action, then he must be conceived asa person among persons, as possessed of rights, as incapable of actingwithout at the same moment claiming for his acts recognition, generality,and logical consecution. The reference, which in the conception of apractical intelligence was implicit,—the reference to fellow-agents, to aworld in which law rules—is thus, by the explicit recognition of thesereferences, made a fact patent and positive—_gesetzt_,—expresslyinstituted in the way that the nature and condition of things postulates.But this is not all: we step from the formal and absolute into thematerial and relative. If man is to be a real intelligence, he must be anintelligence served by organs. “The rational being cannot realise itsefficient individuality, unless it ascribes to itself a material body”: abody, moreover, in which Fichte believes he can show that the details ofstructure and organs are equally with the general corporeity predeterminedby reason(51). In the same way it is shown that the social and politicalorganisation is required for the realisation—the making positive and yetcoherent—of the rights of all individuals. You deduce society by showingit is required to make a genuine individual man. Thirdly came the “Systemof Ethics.” Here it is further argued that, at least in a certainrespect(52), in spite of my absolute reason and my absolute freedom, I canonly be fully real as a part of Nature: that my reason is realised in acreature of appetite and impulse. From first to last this deduction is oneprocess which may be said to have for its object to determine “theconditions of self-hood or egoity.” It is the deduction of the concreteand empirical moral agent—the actual ego of actual life—from the abstract,unconditioned ego, which in order to be actual must condescend to be atonce determining and determined."|FALSE
39064|"In all of this Fichte makes—especially formally—a decided advance uponKant. In Ethics Kant in particular, (—especially for readers who never gotbeyond the beginning of his moral treatise and were overpowered by thecategorical imperative of duty) had found the moral initiative or dynamicapparently in the other world. The voice of duty seemed to speak from aregion outside and beyond the individual conscience. In a sense it must doso: but it comes from a consciousness which is, and yet is more than, theindividual. It is indeed true that appearances here are deceptive: andthat the idea of autonomy, the self-legislation of reason, is trying tobecome the central conception of Kant’s Ethics. Still it is Fichte’s meritto have seen this clearly, to have held it in view unfalteringly, and tohave carried it out in undeviating system or deduction. Man, intelligent,social, ethical, is a being all of one piece and to be explained entirelyimmanently, or from himself. Law and ethics are no accident either tosense or to intelligence—nothing imposed by mere external or supernalauthority(53). Society is not a brand-new order of things supervening uponand superseding a state of nature, where the individual was entirelyself-supporting. Morals, law, society, are all necessary steps (necessaryi.e. in logic, and hence in the long run also inevitable in course oftime) to complete the full evolution or realisation of a human being. Thesame conditions as make man intelligent make him social and moral. He doesnot proceed so far as to become intelligent and practical, under terms ofnatural and logical development, then to fall into the hands of a foreigninfluence, an accident _ab extra_, which causes him to become social andmoral. Rather he is intelligent, because he is a social agent."|FALSE
39064|"Hence, in Fichte, the absence of the ascetic element so often stamping itscharacter on ethics, and representing the moral life as the enemy of thenatural, or as mainly a struggle to subdue the sensibility and the flesh.With Kant,—as becomes his position of mere inquirer—the sensibility hasthe place of a predominant and permanent foreground. Reason, to his way oftalking, is always something of an intruder, a stranger from a far-offworld, to be feared even when obeyed: sublime, rather than beautiful. Fromthe land of sense which we habitually occupy, the land of reason is acountry we can only behold from afar: or if we can be said to have astandpoint in it, that is only a figurative way of saying that though itis really over the border, we can act—it would sometimes seem by a sort ofmake-believe—as if we were already there. But these moments of highenthusiasm are rare; and Kant commends sobriety and warns againsthigh-minded _Schwärmerei_, or over-strained Mysticism. For us it isreserved to struggle with a recalcitrant selfhood, a grovellingsensibility: it were only fantastic extravagance, fit for “fair souls” whounfortunately often lapse into “fair sinners,” should we fancy ourselvesalready anchored in the haven of untempted rest and peace."|FALSE
39064|"When we come to Fichte, we find another spirit breathing. We have passedfrom the age of Frederick the Great to the age of the French Revolution;and the breeze that burst in the War of Liberation is already beginning tofreshen the air. Boldly he pronounces the primacy of that faith of reasonwhereby not merely the just but all shall live. Your will shall show youwhat you really are. You are essentially a rational will, or awill-reason. Your sensuous nature, of impulse and appetite, far from beingthe given and found obstacle to the realisation of reason,—which Kantstrictly interpreted might sometimes seem to imply—(and in this pointSchopenhauer carries out the implications of Kant)—is really the conditionor mode of being which reason assumes, or rises up to, in order to be apractical or moral being. Far from the body and the sensible needs being astumbling-block to hamper the free fullness of rationality and morality,the truth rather is that it is only by body and sense, by flesh and blood,that the full moral and rational life can be realised(54). Or, to put itotherwise, if human reason (intelligence and will) is to be more than amere and empty inner possibility, if man is to be a real and concretecognitive and volitional being, he must be a member of an ethical andactual society, which lives by bread, and which marries and has children."|FALSE
39064|"(iii.) Psychology in Ethics."|FALSE
39064|"In this way, for Fichte, and through Fichte still more decidedly forHegel, both psychology and ethics breathe an opener and ampler air thanthey often enjoy. Psychology ceases to be a mere description of psychicevents, and becomes the history of the self-organising process of humanreason. Ethics loses its cloistered, negative, unnatural aspect, andbecomes a name for some further conditions of the same development,essentially postulated to complete or supplement its shortcomings.Psychology—taken in this high philosophical acceptation—thus leads on toEthics; and Ethics is parted by no impassable line from Psychology. That,at least, is what must happen if they are still to retain a place inphilosophy: for, as Kant says(55), “under the government of reason ourcognitions cannot form a rhapsody, but must constitute a system, in whichalone can they support and further its essential aims.” As parts of such asystem, they carry out their special work in subordination to, and in therealisation of, a single Idea—and therefore in essential interconnexion.From that interconnecting band we may however in detail-enquiry dispenseourselves; and then we have the empirical or inductive sciences ofpsychology and ethics. But even with these, the necessity of the situationis such that it is only a question of degree how far we lose sight of thephilosophical horizon, and entrench ourselves in special enquiry.Something of the philosophic largeness must always guide us; even when, tofurther the interests of the whole, it is necessary for the specialenquirer to bury himself entirely in his part. So long as each part issincerely and thoroughly pursued, and no part is neglected, there is anindwelling reason in the parts which will in the long run tend toconstitute the total."|FALSE
39064|"A philosophical psychology will show us how the sane intelligence and therational will are, at least approximately, built up out of elements, andthrough stages and processes, which modify and complement, as they mayalso arrest and perplex, each other. The unity, coherence, andcompleteness of the intelligent self is not, as vulgar irreflectivenesssupposes and somewhat angrily maintains, a full-grown thing or agent, ofwhose actions and modes of behaviour the psychologist has to narrate thehistory,—a history which is too apt to degenerate into the anecdotal andthe merely interesting. This unity of self has to be “deduced,” as Fichtewould say: it has to be shown as the necessary result which certainelements in a certain order will lead to(56). A normal mind,self-possessed, developed and articulated, yet thoroughly one, a realmicrocosm, or true and full monad, which under the mode of itsindividuality still represents the universe: that is, what psychology hasto show as the product of factors and processes. And it is clearlysomething great and good, something valuable, and already possessing, byimplication we may say, an ethical character."|FALSE
39064|"In philosophy, at least, it is difficult, or rather impossible to draw ahard and fast line which shall demarcate ethical from non-ethicalcharacters,—to separate them from other intellectual and reasonablemotives. Kant, as we know, attempted to do so: but with the result that hewas forced to add a doubt whether a purely moral act could ever be said toexist(57); or rather to express the certainty that if it did it was forever inaccessible to observation. All such designations of the several“factors” or “moments” in reality, as has been hinted, are only _apotiori_. But they are misused when it is supposed that they connoteabrupt and total discontinuity. And Kant, after all, only repeated in hisown terminology an old and inveterate habit of thought:—the habit which inStoicism seemed to see sage and foolish utterly separated, and which inthe straiter sects of Christendom fenced off saint absolutely from sinner.It is a habit to which Hegel, and even his immediate predecessors, areradically opposed. With Herder, he might say, “Ethics is only a higherphysics of the mind(58).” This—the truth in Spinozism—no doubt demandssome emphasis on the word “higher”: and it requires us to read ethics (orsomething like it) into physics; but it is a step on the right road,—thestep which Utilitarianism and Evolutionism had (however awkwardly) gottheir foot upon, and which “transcendent” ethics seems unduly afraid ofcommitting itself to. Let us say, if we like, that the mind is more thanmere nature, and that it is no proper object of a merely natural science.But let us remember that a merely natural science is only a fragment ofscience: let us add that the _merely_ natural is an abstraction which inpart denaturalises and mutilates the larger nature—a nature which includesthe natural mind, and cannot altogether exclude the ethical."|FALSE
39064|"What have been called “formal duties(59)” seem to fall under thisrange—the province of a philosophical psychology which unveils theconditions of personality. Under that heading may be put self-control,consistency, resolution, energy, forethought, prudence, and the like. Thedue proportion of faculty, the correspondence of head and heart, thevivacity and quickness of sympathy, the ease and simplicity of mentaltone, the due vigour of memory and the grace of imagination, sweetness oftemper, and the like, are parts of the same group(60). They are lovely,and of good report: they are praise and virtue. If it be urged that theyare only natural gifts and graces, that objection cuts two ways. Theobjector may of course be reminded that religion tones down theself-complacency of morality. Yet, first, even apart from that, it may besaid that of virtues, which stand independent of natural conditions—ofexternal supply of means (as Aristotle would say)—nothing can be known andnothing need be said. And secondly, none of these qualities are meregifts;—all require exercise, habituation, energising, to get and keepthem. How much and how little in each case is nature’s and how much oursis a problem which has some personal interest—due perhaps to a ratherselfish and envious curiosity. But on the broad field of experience andhistory we may perhaps accept the—apparently one-sided—proverb that “Eachman is the architect of his own fortune.” Be this as it may, it will notdo to deny the ethical character of these “formal duties” on the grounde.g. that self-control, prudence, and even sweetness of temper may be usedfor evil ends,—that one may smile and smile, and yet be a villain.That—let us reply,—on one hand, is a fault (if fault it be) incidental toall virtues in detail (for every single quality has its defect): nay itmay be a limitation attaching to the whole ethical sphere: and, secondly,its inevitable limitation does not render the virtue in any case one whitless genuine so far as it goes. And yet of such virtues it may be said, asHume(61) would say (who calls them “natural,” as opposed to the moreartificial merits of justice and its kin), that they please in themselves,or in the mere contemplation, and without any regard to their socialeffects. But they please as entering into our idea of complete humannature, of mind and spirit as will and intellect."|FALSE
39064|"The moralists of last century sometimes divided the field of ethics byassigning to man three grades or kinds of duty: duties to himself, dutiesto society, and duties to God. For the distinction there is a good deal tobe said: there are also faults to be found with it. It may be said,amongst other things, that to speak of duties to self is a metaphoricalway of talking, and that God lies out of the range of human dutyaltogether, except in so far as religious service forms a part of socialobligation. It may be urged that man is essentially a social being, andthat it is only in his relations to other such beings that his moralitycan find a sphere. The sphere of morality, according to Dr. Bain, embraceswhatever “society has seen fit to enforce with all the rigour of positiveinflictions. Positive good deeds and self-sacrifice ... transcend theregion of morality proper and occupy a sphere of their own(62).” And thereis little doubt that this restriction is in accordance with a main currentof usage. It may even be said that there are tendencies towards a narrowerusage still, which would restrict the term to questions affecting therelations of the sexes. But, without going so far, we may accept thestandpoint which finds in the phrase “popular or social” sanction, asequivalent to the moral sanction, a description of the average level ofcommon opinion on the topic. The morality of an age or country thusdenotes, first, the average requirement in act and behaviour imposed bygeneral consent on the members of a community, and secondly, the averageperformance of the members in response to these requirements. Generallyspeaking the two will be pretty much the same. If the society is in astate of equilibrium, there will be a palpable agreement between what allseverally expect and what all severally perform. On the other hand, as nosociety is ever in complete equilibrium, this harmony will never beperfect and may often be widely departed from. In what is called a singlecommunity, if it reach a considerable bulk, there are (in other words)often a number of minor societies, more or less thwarting and modifyingeach other; and different observers, who belong in the main to one orother of these subordinate groups, may elicit from the facts before them asomewhat different social code, and a different grade of socialobservance. Still, with whatever diversity of detail, the importantfeature of such social ethics is that the stress is laid on theperformance of certain acts, in accordance with the organisation ofsociety. So long as the required compliance is given, public opinion issatisfied, and morality has got its due."|FALSE
39064|"But in two directions this conception of morality needs to besupplementing. There is, on one hand, what is called duty to God. Thephrase is not altogether appropriate: for it follows too closely theanalogy of social requirement, and treats Deity as an additional andsocial authority,—a lord paramount over merely human sovereigns. Butthough there may be some use in the analogy, to press the conception isseriously to narrow the divine character and the scope of religion. As insimilar cases, we cannot change one term without altering its correlative.And therefore to describe our relation to God under the name of duty is tonarrow and falsify that relation. The word is no longer applicable in thisconnexion without a strain, and where it exists it indicates the survivalof a conception of theocracy: of God regarded as a glorification of themagistrate, as king of kings and lord of lords. It is the social world—andindeed we may say the outside of the social world—that is the sphere ofduties. Duty is still with these reductions a great august name: but inliteral strictness it only rules over the medial sphere of life, thesphere which lies between the individual as such and his universalhumanity(63). Beyond duty, lies the sphere of conscience and of religion.And that is not the mere insistence by the individual to have a voice anda vote in determining the social order. It is the sense that the socialorder, however omnipotent it may seem, is limited and finite, and that manhas in him a kindred with the Eternal."|FALSE
39064|"It is not very satisfactory, either, as Aristotle and others have pointedout, to speak of man’s duties to himself. The phrase is analogical, likethe other. But it has the merit, like that of duty to God, of reminding usthat the ordinary latitude occupied by morality is not all that comesunder the larger scope of ethics. The “ethics of individual life” is asubject which Mr. Spencer has touched upon: and by this title, he meansthat, besides his general relationship to others, a human being has tomind his own health, food, and amusement, and has duties as husband andparent. But, after all, these are not matters of peculiarly individualinterest. They rather refer to points which society at certain epochsleaves to the common sense of the agent,—apparently on an assumption thathe is the person chiefly interested. And these points—as the Greeks taughtlong ago—are of fundamental importance: they are the very bases of life.Yet the comparative neglect in which so-called civilised societies(64)hold the precepts of wisdom in relation to bodily health and vigour, inregard to marriage and progeny, serve to illustrate the doctrine of theancient Stoics that πάντα ὑπόληψις, or the modern idealist utterance thatthe World is my idea. More and more as civilisation succeeds in itsdisruption of man from nature, it shows him governed not by bare facts andisolated experiences, but by the systematic idea under which all thingsare subsumed. He loses the naïveté of the natural man, which takes eachfact as it came, all alike good: he becomes sentimental, and artificial,sees things under a conventional point of view, and would rather die thannot be in the fashion. And this tendency is apparently irresistible. Yetthe mistake lies in the one-sidedness of sentiment and convention. Not thedomination of the idea is evil; but the domination of a partial andfragmentary idea: and this is what constitutes the evil of artificiality.And the correction must lie not in a return to nature, but in thereconstruction of a wider and more comprehensive idea: an idea which shallbe the unity and system of all nature; not a fantastic idealism, but anattempt to do justice to the more realist as well as the idealist sides oflife."|FALSE
39064|"There is however another side of individualist ethics which needs evenmore especial enforcement. It is the formation of"|FALSE
39064|"    “The reason firm, the temperate will,    Endurance, foresight, strength and skill:”"|FALSE
39064|"the healthy mind in a healthy body. Ethics is only too apt to suppose thatwill and intelligence are assumptions which need no special justification.But the truth is that they vary from individual to individual in degreeand structure. It is the business of ethical psychology to give to thesevague attributions the definiteness of a normal standard: to show whatproportions are required to justify the proper title of reason and will—toshow what reason and will really are if they do what they are encouragedor expected to do. It talks of the diseases of will and personality: itmust also set forth their educational ideal. The first problem of Ethics,it may be said, is the question of the will and its freedom. But to saythis is of course not to say that, unless freedom of will be understood insome special sense, ethics becomes impossible. If the moral law is the_ratio cognoscendi_ of freedom, then must our conception of morality andof freedom hang together. And it will clearly be indispensable to begin bysome attempt to discover in what sense man may be in the most general waydescribed as a moral agent—as an intelligent will, or (more briefly, yetsynonymously) as a will. “The soil of law and morality,” says Hegel(65),“is the intelligent life: and its more precise place and starting-pointthe will, which is free, in the sense that freedom is its substance andcharacteristic, and the system of law the realm of freedom realised, theworld of intelligence produced out of itself as a second nature.” Such afreedom is a freedom made and acquired, the work of the mind’sself-realisation, not to be taken as a given fact of consciousness whichmust be believed(66). To have a will—in other words, to have freedom, isthe consummation—and let us add, only the formal or ideal consummation—ofa process by which man raises himself out of his absorption in sensationand impulse, establishes within himself a mental realm, an organism ofideas, a self-consciousness, and a self."|FALSE
39064|"The vulgar apprehension of these things seems to assume that we have bynature, or are born with, a general faculty or set of general faculties,which we subsequently fill up and embody by the aid of experience. Wepossess—they seem to imply—so many “forms” and “categories” latent in ourminds ready to hold and contain the raw materials supplied from without.According to this view we have all a will and an intelligence: thedifference only is that some put more into them, and some put less. Butsuch a separation of the general form from its contents is a piece of puremythology. It is perhaps true and safe to say that the human being is ofsuch a character that will and intelligence are in the ordinary courseinevitably produced. But the forms which grow up are the more and moredefinite and systematic organisation of a graded experience, of series ofideas, working themselves up again and again in representative andre-representative degree, till they constitute a mental or inner world oftheir own. The will is thus the title appropriate to the final stage of aprocess, by which sensation and impulse have polished and perfectedthemselves by union and opposition, by differentiation and accompanyingredintegration, till they assume characters quite unsurmised in theirearliest aspects, and yet only the consolidation or self-realisation ofimplications. Thus the mental faculties are essentially acquiredpowers,—acquired not from without, but by action which generates thefaculties it seems to imply. The process of mind is a process whichcreates individual centres, raises them to completer independence;—whichproduces an inner life more and more self-centered and also more and moreequal to the universe which it has embodied. And will and intelligence arean important stage in that process."|FALSE
39064|"Herbart (as was briefly hinted at in the first essay) has analysed ethicalappreciation (which may or may not be accompanied by approbation) intofive distinct standard ideas. These are the ideas of inward liberty, ofperfection, of right, benevolence, and equity. Like Hume, he regards themoral judgment as in its purity a kind of aesthetic pronouncement on theagreement or proportion of certain activities in relations to each other.Two of these standard ideas,—that of inward liberty and of perfection—seemto belong to the sphere at present under review. They emerge as conditionsdetermining the normal development of human nature to an intelligent andmatured personality. By inward freedom Herbart means the harmony betweenthe will and the intellect: what Aristotle has named “practical truth orreality,” and what he describes in his conception of wisdom or moralintelligence,—the power of discerning the right path and of pursuing itwith will and temper: the unity, clear but indissoluble, of will anddiscernment. By the idea of perfection Herbart means the sense ofproportion and of propriety which is awakened by comparing a progress indevelopment or an increase in strength with its earlier stages of promiseand imperfection. The pleasure such perception affords works in two ways:it is a satisfaction in achievement past, and a stimulus to achievementyet to come."|FALSE
39064|"Such ideas of inward liberty and of growth in ability or in performancegovern (at least in part) our judgment of the individual, and have anethical significance. Indeed, if the cardinal feature of the ethicalsentiment be the inwardness and independence of its approbation andobligation, these ideas lie at the root of all true morality. Inwardharmony and inward progress, lucidity of conscience and the resolutionwhich knows no finality of effort, are the very essence of moral life.Yet, if ethics is to include in the first instance social relationshipsand external utilities and sanctions, these conditions of true life mustrather be described as pre-ethical. The truth seems to be that here we getto a range of ethics which is far wider than what is ordinarily calledpractice and conduct. At this stage logic, aesthetic, and ethic, are yetone: the true, the good, and the beautiful are still held in theirfundamental unity. An ethics of wide principle precedes its narrowersocial application; and whereas in ordinary usage the social provincialityis allowed to prevail, here the higher ethics emerge clear and imperialabove the limitations of local and temporal duty."|FALSE
39064|"And though it is easy to step into exaggeration, it is still well toemphasise this larger conception of ethics. The moral principle of the“maximising of life,” as it has been called(67), may be open tomisconception (—so, unfortunately are all moral principles when stated inthe effrontery of isolation): but it has its truth in the conviction thatall moral evil is marked by a tendency to lower or lessen the totalvitality. So too Friedrich Nietzsche’s maxim, _Sei vornehm_(68), ensuedistinction, and above all things be not common or vulgar (_gemein_), willeasily lend itself to distortion. But it is good advice for all that, eventhough it may be difficult to define in a general formula whereindistinction consists, to mark the boundary between self-respect and vanityor obstinacy, or to say wherein lies the beauty and dignity of humannature. Kant has laid it down as the principle of duty to ask ourselves ifin our act we are prepared to universalise the maxim implied by ourconduct. And that this—which essentially bids us look at an act in thewhole of its relations and context—is a safeguard against some forms ofmoral evil, is certain. But there is an opposite—or rather an apparentlyopposite—principle which bids us be individual, be true to our own selves,and never allow ourselves to be dismayed from our own uniqueresponsibility. Perhaps the two principles are not so far apart as theyseem. In any case true individuality is the last word and the first wordin ethics; though, it may be added, there is a good deal to be saidbetween the two termini."|FALSE
39064|"(iv.) An Excursus on Greek Ethics."|FALSE
39064|"It is in these regions that Greek ethics loves to linger; on the duty ofthe individual to himself, to be perfectly lucid and true, and to rise toever higher heights of achievement. _Ceteris paribus_, there is felt to besomething meritorious in superiority, something good:—even were it thatyou are master, and another is slave. Thus naïvely speaks Aristotle(69).To a modern, set amid so many conflicting ideals, perhaps, the immensepossibilities of yet further growth might suggest themselves withoverpowering force. To him the idea of perfection takes the form of anidea of perfectibility: and sometimes it smites down his conceit in whathe has actually done, and impresses a sense of humility in comparison withwhat yet remains unaccomplished. An ancient Greek apparently was littlehaunted by these vistas of possibilities of progress through worlds beyondworlds. A comparatively simple environment, a fixed and definite mentalhorizon, had its plain and definite standards, or at least seemed to havesuch. There were fewer cases of the man, unattached or faintly attached toany definite profession—moving about in worlds half realised—who has grownso common in a more developed civilisation. The ideals of the Greek wereclearly descried: each man had his definite function or work to perform:and to do it better than the average, or than he himself habitually haddone, that was perfection, excellence, virtue. For virtue to the Greek isessentially ability and respectability: promise of excellent performance:capacity to do better than others. Virtue is praiseworthy or meritoriouscharacter and quality: it is achievement at a higher rate, as set againstone’s past and against others’ average."|FALSE
39064|"The Greek moralists sometimes distinguish and sometimes combine moralvirtue and wisdom, ἀρετή and φρόνησις: capacity to perform, and wisdom toguide that capacity. To the ordinary Greek perhaps the emphasis fell onthe former, on the attainment of all recognised good quality which becamea man, all that was beautiful and honourable, all that was appropriate,glorious, and fame-giving; and that not for any special reference to itsutilitarian qualities. Useful, of course, such qualities were: but thatwas not in question at the time. In the more liberal commonwealths ofancient Greece there was little or no anxious care to control theeducation of its citizens, so as to get direct service, overt contributionto the public good. A suspicious Spartan legislation might claim to dothat. But in the free air of Athens all that was required was loyalty,good-will—εὔνοια—to the common weal; it might be even a sentiment of humankindliness, of fraternity of spirit and purpose. Everything beyond andupon that basis was left to free development. Let each carry out to thefull the development of his powers in the line which national estimationpoints out. He is—nature and history alike emphasise that fact beyond thereach of doubt, for all except the outlaw and the casual stranger—a memberof a community, and as such has a governing instinct and ideal whichanimates him. But he is also a self-centered individual, with specialendowments of nature, in his own person and in the material objects whichare his. A purely individualist or selfish use of them is not—to thenormal Greek—even dreamed of. He is too deeply rooted in the substance ofhis community for that: or it is on the ground and in the atmosphere of anassured community that his individuality is to be made to flourish. Naturehas secured that his individuality shall rest securely in thepresupposition of his citizenship. It seems, therefore, as if he were leftfree and independent in his personal search for perfection, fordistinction. His place is fixed for him: _Spartam nactus es; hanc orna_:his duty is his virtue. That duty, as Plato expresses it, is to do his owndeeds—and not meddle with others. Nature and history have arranged thatothers, in other posts, shall do theirs: that all severally shall energisetheir function. The very word “duty” seems out of place; if, at least,duty suggests external obligation, an order imposed and a debt to bedischarged. If there be a task-master and a creditor, it is the inflexibleorder of nature and history:—or, to be more accurate, of nature, theindwelling and permanent reality of things. But the obligation to follownature is scarcely felt as a yoke of constraint. A man’s virtue is toperform his work and to perform it well: to do what he is speciallycapable of doing, and therefore specially charged to do."|FALSE
39064|"Nowhere has this character of Greek ethics received more classicalexpression than in the Republic of Plato. In the prelude to hissubject—which is the nature of Right and Morality—Plato has touchedbriefly on certain popular and inadequate views. There is the view thatRight has its province in performance of certain single and externalacts—in business honesty and commercial straightforwardness. There is theview that it is rendering to each what is due to him; that it consists inthe proper reciprocity of services, in the balance of social give andtake. There is the critical or hyper-critical view which, from seeing somuch that is called justice to be in harmony with the interest of thepredominant social order, bluntly identifies mere force or strength as theground of right. And there are views which regard it as due to socialconventions and artifices, to the influence of education, to politicalarrangements and the operation of irrational prejudices. To all theseviews Plato objects: not because they are false—for they are all in part,often in large part, true—but because they are inadequate and do not go tothe root of the matter. The foundations of right lie, he says, not inexternal act, but in the inner man: not in convention, but in nature: notin relation to others, but in the constitution of the soul itself. Thatethical idea—the idea of right—which seems most obviously to have itscentre outside the individual, to live and grow only in the relationsbetween individuals, Plato selects in order to show the independentroyalty of the single human soul. The world, as Hume afterwards, calledjustice artificial: Plato will prove it natural. In a way he joins companywith those who bid us drive out the spectre of duty, of obligation comingupon the soul from social authority, from traditional idea, from religioussanctions. He preaches—or he is about to preach—the autonomy of the will."|FALSE
39064|"The four cardinal virtues of Plato’s list are the qualities which go tomake a healthy, normal, natural human soul, fit for all activity, equippedwith all arms for the battle of life. They tell us what such a soul is,not what it does. They are the qualities which unless a soul has, and hasthem each perfect, yet all co-operant, its mere outward and single actshave no virtue or merit, but are only lucky accidents at the best. On theother hand, if a man has these constitutive qualities, he will act in thesocial world, and act well. Plato has said scornful things of mere outwardand verbal truthfulness, and has set at the very lowest pitch ofdegradation the “lie in the soul.” His “temperance” or “self-restraint,”if it be far from breathing any suggestion of self-suppression orself-assertion, is still farther from any suspicion of asceticism, or waragainst the flesh. It is the noble harmony of the ruling and the ruled,which makes the latter a partner of the sovereign, and takes from thedictates of the ruler any touch of coercion. It is literally sanity ofsoul, integrity and purity of spirit; it is what has been sometimes calledthe beautiful soul—the indiscerptible unity of reason and impulse. Plato’sbravery, again, is fortitude and consistency of soul, the full-bloodedheart which is fixed in reason, the zeal which is according to knowledge,unflinching loyalty to the idea, the spirit which burns in the martyrs totruth and humanity: yet withal with gentleness and courtesy and nobleurbanity in its immediate train. And his truthfulness is that innerlucidity which cannot be self-deceived, the spirit which is a safeguardagainst fanaticism and hypocrisy, the sunlike warmth of intelligencewithout which the heart is a darkness full of unclean things."|FALSE
39064|"The full development and crowning grace of such a manly nature Aristotlehas tried to present in the character of the Great-souled man—him whomPlato has called the true king by divine right, or the autocrat by thepatent of nature. Like all such attempts to delineate a type in the termsnecessarily single and successive of abstract analysis, it tendsoccasionally to run into caricature, and to give partial aspects an absurdprominency. Only the greatest of artists could cope with such a task,though that artist may be found perhaps classed among the historians. Yetit is possible to form some conception of the ideal which Aristotle wouldset before us. The Great-souled man _is_ great, and he dare not deny thewitness of his spirit. He is one who does not quail before the anger andseek the applause of popular opinion: he holds his head as his own, and ashigh as his undimmed self-consciousness shows it is worth.

39064|"If the Greek world in general thus conceived ἀρετή as the full bloom ofmanly excellence (we all know how slightly—witness the remarks in thePericlean oration—Greeks, in their public and official utterances, ratedwomanliness), the philosophers had a further point to emphasise. That waswhat they variously called knowledge, prudence, reason, insight,intelligence, wisdom, truth. From Socrates to Aristotle, from Aristotle tothe Stoics and Epicureans, and from the Stoics to the Neo-Platonists, thisis the common theme: the supremacy of knowledge, its central and essentialrelation to virtue. They may differ—perhaps not so widely as currentprejudice would suppose—as to how this knowledge is to be defined, whatkind of knowledge it is, how acquired and maintained, and so on. But inessentials they are at one. None of them, of course, mean that in order toright conduct nothing more is needed than to learn and remember what isright, the precepts and commandments of ordinary morality. Memory is notknowledge, especially when it is out of mind. Even an ancient philosopherwas not wholly devoid of common sense. They held—what they supposed was afact of observation and reflection—that all action was prompted byfeelings of the values of things, by a desire of something good orpleasing to self, and aimed at self-satisfaction and self-realisation, butthat there was great mistake in what thus afforded satisfaction. Peoplechose to act wrongly or erroneously, because they were, first, mistakenabout themselves and what they wanted, and, secondly, mistaken in themeans which would give them satisfaction. But this second point wassecondary. The main thing was to know yourself, what you really were; inPlato’s words, to “see the soul as it is, and know whether it have oneform only or many, or what its nature is; to look upon it with the eye ofreason in its original purity.” Self-deception, confusion, that worstignorance which is unaware of itself, false estimation—these are theradical evils of the natural man. To these critics the testimony ofconsciousness was worthless, unless corroborated. To cure this mentalconfusion, this blindness of will and judgment, is the task set forphilosophy: to give inward light, to teach true self-measurement. In onepassage, much misunderstood, Plato has called this philosophic art the duemeasurement of pleasures and pains. It should scarcely have been possibleto mistake the meaning. But, with the catchwords of Utilitarianism ringingin their ears, the commentators ran straight contrary to the true teachingof the _Protagoras_, consentient as it is with that of the _Phaedo_ andthe _Philebus_. To measure, one must have a standard: and if Plato has onelesson always for us, it is that a sure standard the multitude have not,but only confusion. The so-called pleasures and pains of the world’sexperiences are so entitled for different reasons, for contrary aims, andwith no unity or harmony of judgment. They are—not a fact to be accepted,but—a problem for investigation: their reality is in question, theirgenuineness, solidity and purity: and till you have settled that, youcannot measure, for you may be measuring vacuity under the idea that thereis substance. You have still to get at the unit—i.e. the reality ofpleasure. It was not Plato’s view that pleasure was a separate andindependent entity: that it was exactly as it was felt. Each pleasure isdependent for its pleasurable quality on the consciousness it belongs to,and has only a relative truth and reality. Bentham has written aboutcomputing the value of a “lot” of pleasures and pains. But Plato had hismind on an earlier and more fundamental problem, what is the truth andreality of pleasure; and his fullest but not his only essay towardsdetermining the value or estimating the meaning of pleasure in the scaleof being is that given in the _Philebus_."|FALSE
39064|"This then is the knowledge which Greek philosophy meant: not mereintellect—though, of course, there is always a danger of theoreticalinquiry degenerating into abstract and formal dogma. But of the meaningthere can be no serious doubt. It is a knowledge, says Plato, to which themethod of mathematical science—the most perfect he can findacknowledged—is only an _ouverture_, or perhaps, only the preliminarytuning of the strings. It is a knowledge not eternally hypothetical—asystem of sequences which have no sure foundation. It is a knowledge whichrests upon the conviction and belief of the “idea of good”: a kind ofknowledge which does not come by direct teaching, which is not meretheory, but implies a lively conviction, a personal apprehension, a crisiswhich is a kind of “conversion,” or “inspiration.” It is as it were theprize of a great contest, in which the sword that conquers is the sword ofdialectic: a sword whereof the property is, like that of Ithuriel’s spear,to lay bare all deceptions and illusions of life. Or, to vary themetaphor: the son of man is like the prince in the fairy tale who goesforth to win the true queen; but there are many false pretenders deckedout to deceive his unwary eyes and foolish heart. Yet in himself there isa power of discernment: there is something kindred with the truth:—thewitness of the Spirit—and all that education and discipline can do is toremove obstacles, especially the obstacles within the self which perturbthe sight and mislead the judgment. Were not the soul originally possessedof and dominated by the idea of good, it could never discern it elsewhere.On this original kindred depends all the process of education; theinfluence of which therefore is primarily negative or auxiliary. Thus theprocess of history and experience,—which the work of education onlyreproduces in an accelerated _tempo_—serves but to bring out the implicitreason within into explicit conformity with the rationality of the world."|FALSE
39064|"Knowledge, then, in this ethical sphere means the harmony of will,emotion, intellect: it means the clear light which has no illusions and nodeceptions. And to those who feel that much of their life and of thecommon life is founded on prejudice and illusion, such white light willoccasionally seem hard and steely. At its approach they fear the loss ofthe charm of that twilight hour ere the day has yet begun, or before thedarkness has fully settled down. Thus the heart and feelings look upon theintellect as an enemy of sentiment. And Plato himself is not withoutanticipations of such an issue. Yet perhaps we may add that the danger isin part an imaginary one, and only arises because intelligence takes itstask too lightly, and encroaches beyond its proper ground. Philosophy, inother words, mistakes its place when it sets itself up as a dogmaticsystem of life. Its function is to comprehend, and from comprehension tocriticise, and through criticising to unify. It has no positive andadditional teaching of its own: no addition to the burden of life andexperience. And experience it must respect. Its work is to maintain theorganic or super-organic interconnexion between all the spheres of lifeand all the forms of reality. It has to prevent stagnation and absorptionof departments—to keep each in its proper place, but not more than itsplace, and yet to show how each is not independent of the others. And thisis what the philosopher or ancient sage would be. If he is passionless, itis not that he has no passions, but that they no longer perturb andmislead. If his controlling spirit be reason, it is not the reason of theso-called “rationalist,” but the reason which seeks in patience tocomprehend, and to be at home in, a world it at first finds strange. Andif he is critical of others, he is still more critical of himself:critical however not for criticism’s sake (which is but a poor thing), butbecause through criticism the faith of reason may be more fully justified.To the last, if he is true to his mission and faithful to his loyalty toreality, he will have the simplicity of the child."|FALSE
39064|"Whether therefore we agree or not with Plato’s reduction of Right and Dutyto self-actualisation, we may at least admit that in the idea ofperfection or excellence, combined with the idea of knowledge or inwardlucidity, he has got the fundamental ideas on which further ethicaldevelopment must build. Self-control, self-knowledge, internal harmony,are good: and so are the development of our several faculties and of thetotality of them to the fullest pitch of excellence. But their value doesnot lie entirely in themselves, or rather there is implicit in them areference to something beyond themselves. They take for granted somethingwhich, because it is so taken, may also be ignored and neglected, justbecause it seems so obvious. And that implication is the social humanityin which they are the spirits of light and leading."|FALSE
39064|"To lay the stress on ἀρετή or excellence tends to leave out of sight theforce of duty; and to emphasise knowledge is allowed to disparage theheart and feelings. The mind—even of a philosopher—finds a difficulty inholding very different points of view in one, and where it is forced fromone to another, tends to forget the earlier altogether. Thus when theethical philosopher, presupposing as an absolute or unquestionable factthat man the individual was rooted in the community, proceeded to discussthe problem of the best and completest individual estate, he was easilyled to lose sight of the fundamental and governing condition altogether.From the moment that Aristotle lays down the thesis that man is naturallysocial, to the moment when he asks how the bare ideal of excellence incharacter and life can become an actuality, the community in which manlives has retired out of sight away into the background. And it only comesin, as it first appears, as the paedagogue to bring us to morality. AndPlato, though professedly he is speaking of the community, and is wellaware that the individual can only be saved by the salvation of thecommunity, is constantly falling back into another problem—the developmentof an individual soul. He feels the strength of the egoistic effort afterperfection, and his essay in the end tends to lose sight altogether of itssecond theme. Instead of a man he gives us a mere philosopher, a man, thatis, not living with his country’s life, instinct with the heart andfeeling of humanity, inspired by art and religion, but a being set apartand exalted above his fellows,—charged no doubt in theory with the duty ofsaving them, of acting vicariously as the mediator between them and theabsolute truth—but really tending more and more to seclude himself on the_edita templa_ of the world, on the high-towers of speculation."|FALSE
39064|"And what Plato and Aristotle did, so to speak, against their expresspurpose and effort, yet did, because the force of contemporary tendencywas irresistible—that the Stoa and Epicurus did more openly andprofessedly. With a difference in theory, it is true, owing to thedifference in the surroundings. Virtue in the older day of the free andglorious commonwealth had meant physical and intellectual achievement,acts done in the public eye, and of course for the public good—a good withwhich the agent was identified at least in heart and soul, if not in hisexplicit consciousness. In later and worse days, when the political world,with the world divine, had withdrawn from actual identity with the centralheart of the individual, and stood over-against him as a strange power andlittle better than a nuisance, virtue came to be counted as endurance,indifference, negative independence against a cold and a perplexing world.But even still, virtue is excellence: it is to rise above the ignoblelevel: to assert self-liberty against accident and circumstance—to attainself-controlled, self-satisfying independence—and to become God-like inits seclusion. Yet in two directions even it had to acknowledge somethingbeyond the individual. The Epicurean—following out a suggestion ofAristotle—recognised the help which the free society of friends gave tothe full development of the single seeker after a self-satisfying andcomplete life. The Stoic, not altogether refusing such help, tended ratherto rest his single self on a fellowship of ideal sort, on the great cityof gods and men, the _civitas Dei_. Thus, in separate halves, the twoschools, into which Greek ethics was divided, gave expression to the sensethat a new and higher community was needed—to the sense that the visibleactual community no longer realised its latent idea. The Stoic emphasisedthe all-embracing necessity, the absolute comprehensiveness of the moralkingdom. The Epicurean saw more clearly that, if the everlasting city camefrom heaven, it could only visibly arise by initiation upon the earth.Christianity—in its best work—was a conjunction of the liberty with thenecessity, of the human with the divine."|FALSE
39064|"More interesting, perhaps, it is to note the misconception of reason andknowledge which grew up. Knowledge came more and more to be identifiedwith the reflective and critical consciousness, which is outside realityand life, and judges it from a standpoint of its own. It came to beesteemed only in its formal and abstract shape, and at the expense of theheart and feelings. The antithesis of philosophy (or knowledge strictly socalled) according to Plato was mere opinion, accidental and imperfectknowledge. The knowledge which is truly valuable is a knowledge whichpresupposes the full reality of life, and is the more and more completelyarticulated theory of it as a whole. It is—abstractly taken—a mere form ofunity which has no value except in uniting: it is—taken concretely—thematter, we may say, in complete unity. It is ideal and perfect harmony ofthought, appetite, and emotion: or putting it otherwise, the philosopheris one who is not merely a creature of appetite and production, not merelya creature of feeling and practical energy, but a creature, who to both ofthese superadds an intelligence which sets eyes in the blind forehead ofthese other powers, and thus, far from superseding them altogether, onlyraises them into completeness, and realises all that is worthy in theirimplicit natures. Always these two impulsive tendencies of our nature areguided by some sort of ideas and intelligence, by beliefs and opinions.But they, like their guides, are sporadically emergent, unconnected, andtherefore apt to be contradictory. It is to such erratic and occasionalideas, half-truths and deceptions, that philosophy is opposed.Unfortunately for all parties, the antithesis is carried farther.Philosophy and the philosopher are further set in opposition to the faithof the heart, the intimacy and intensity of feeling, the depth of love andtrust, which in practice often go along with imperfect ideas. Thephilosopher is made one who has emancipated himself from the heart andfeelings,—a pure intelligence, who is set above all creeds, contemplatingall, and holding none. Consistency and clearness become his idol, to beworshipped at any cost, save one sacrifice: and that one sacrifice is thesacrifice of his own self-conceit. For consistency generally means thatall is made to harmonise with one assumed standpoint, and that whateverpresents discrepancies with this alleged standard is ruthlessly thrownaway. Such a philosophy mistakes its function, which is not, as Heinescoffs, to make an intelligible system by rejecting the discordantfragments of life, but to follow reverently, if slowly, in the wake ofexperience. Such a “perfect sage,” with his parade of reasonableness, mayoften assume the post of a dictator."|FALSE
39064|"And, above all, intelligence is only half itself when it is not also will.And both are more than mere consciousness. Plato—whom we refer to, becausehe is the coryphaeus of all the diverse host of Greek philosophy—seems tooverestimate or rather to misconceive the place of knowledge. That it isthe supreme and crowning grace of the soul, he sees. But he tends toidentify it with the supreme or higher soul:—as Aristotle did after him,to be followed by the Stoics and Neo-Platonists. For them the supreme, oralmost supreme reality is the intelligence or reason: the soul is only ona second grade of reality, on the borders of the natural or physicalworld. When Plato takes that line, he turns towards the path ofasceticism, and treats the philosophic life as a preparation for thattruer life when intelligence shall be all in all, for that better landwhere “divine dialogues” shall form the staple and substance of spiritualexistence. Aristotle,—who less often treads these solitudes,—still extolsthe theoretic life, when the body and its needs trouble no more, when theactivity of reason—the theory of theory—is attained at least as entirelyas mortal conditions allow man to be deified. Of the “apathy” and thereasonable conformity of the Stoics, or of the purely negative characterof Epicurean happiness (the excision of all that pained) we need not herespeak. And in Plotinus and Proclus the deification of mere reason is atany rate the dominant note; whatever protests the larger Greek nature inthe former may from time to time offer. The truth which philosophy shouldhave taught was that Mind or intelligence was the element where the innerlife culminated and expanded and flourished: the error which it oftentended to spread was that intelligence was the higher life of which allother was a degenerate shortcoming, and something valuable on its ownaccount."|FALSE
39064|"It may be that thus to interpret Plato is to do him an injustice. It hasbeen sometimes said that his division of parts or kinds of soul—or hisdistinction between its fighting horses—tends to destroy the unity ofmental life. But perhaps this was exactly what he wanted to convey. Thereare—we may paraphrase his meaning—three kinds of human being, three typesof human life. There is the man or the life of appetite and the flesh:there is the man of noble emotion and energetic depth of soul: there isthe life of reasonable pursuits and organised principle. Or, we may takehis meaning to be that there are three elements or provinces of mentallife, which in all except a few are but imperfectly coherent and do notreach a true or complete unity. Some unity there always is: but in thelife of mere appetite and impulse, even when these impulses are our noblersentiments of love and hatred, the unity falls very far short. Or, as heputs the theme elsewhere, the soul has a passion for self-completion, alove of beauty, which in most is but a misleading lust. It is the businessof the philosophic life to re-create or to foster this unity: orphilosophy is the persistent search of the soul for its lost unity, thesearch to see that unity which is always its animating principle, itsinner faith. When the soul has reached this ideal—if it can be supposed toattain it (and of this the strong-souled ancient philosophers feel nodoubt),—then a change must take place. The love of beauty is notsuppressed; it is only made self-assured and its object freed from allimperfection. It is not that passion has ceased; but its nature is sotransfigured, that it seems worthy of a nobler name, which yet we cannotgive. To such a life, where battle and conflict are as such unknown, wecannot longer give the title of life: and we say that philosophy is inlife a rehearsal of death(70). And yet if there be no battle, there is notfor that reason mere inaction. Hence, as the Republic concludes, the truephilosopher is the complete man. He is the truth and reality which theappetitive and emotional man were seeking after and failed to realise. Itis true they at first will not see this. But the whole long process ofphilosophy is the means to induce this conviction. And for Plato itremains clear that through experience, through wisdom, and throughabstract deduction, the philosopher will justify his claim to him who hathears to hear and heart to understand. If that be so, the asceticism ofPlato is not a mere war upon flesh and sense as such, but upon flesh andsense as imperfect truth, fragmentary reality, which suppose themselvescomplete, though they are again and again confuted by experience, bywisdom, and by mere calculation,—a war against their blindness andshortsightedness."|FALSE

Itmeans that the mental world does not abruptly emerge a full-grownintelligence, but has a genesis, and follows a law of development: thatits life may be described as the differentiation (with integration) of asimple or indifferentiated mass. The terms conscious and unconscious,indeed, with their lax popular uses, leave the door wide open formisconception. But they may serve to mark that the mind is to beunderstood only in a certain relation (partly of antithesis) to nature,and the soul only in reference to the body. The so-called “superiorfaculties”—specially characteristic of humanity—are founded upon, and donot abruptly supersede, the lower powers which are supposed to bespecially obvious in the animals(72). The individual and specificphenomena of consciousness, which the psychologist is generally supposedto study, rest upon a deeper, less explicated, more indefinite, life ofsensibility, which in its turn fades away by immeasurable gradations intosomething irresponsive to the ordinary tests for sensation and life."|FALSE

The problem is to some extent the same as confronts the studentof the ideas and principles of primitive races. There, the temptation ofseeing things through the “spectacles of civilisation” is almostirresistible. So in psychology we are apt to import into the life ofsensation and feeling the distinctions and relations of subsequentintellection. Nor is the difficulty lessened by Hegel’s method which dealswith soul, sentiency, and consciousness as grades or generalcharacteristics in a developmental advance. He borrows his illustrationsfrom many quarters, from morbid and anomalous states ofconsciousness,—less from the cases of savages, children and animals. Theseillustrations may be called a loose induction. But it requires a much morepowerful instrument than mere induction to build up a scientific system; aframework of general principle or theory is the only basis on which tobuild theory by the allegation of facts, however numerous.

Themind comes before it as the supreme product of the natural world, thefinest flower of organic life, the “truth” of the physical process. Assuch it is called by the time-honoured name of Soul. If we further go onto say that the soul is the principle of life, we must not understand thisvital principle to be something over and above the life of which it is theprinciple. Such a locally-separable principle is an addition which is dueto the analogy of mechanical movement, where a detached agent sets inmotion and directs the machinery. But in the organism the principle is notthus detachable as a thing or agent. By calling Soul the principle of lifewe rather mean that in the vital organism, so far as it _lives_, all thereal variety, separation, and discontinuity of parts must be reduced tounity and identity, or as Hegel would say, to _ideality_. To live is thusto keep all differences fluid and permeable in the fire of thelife-process. Or to use a familiar term of logic, the Soul is the conceptor intelligible unity of the organic body. But to call it a concept mightsuggest that it is only the conception through which _we_ represent toourselves the variety in unity of the organism. The soul, however, is morethan a mere concept: and life is more than a mere mode of description fora group of movements forming an objective unity. It is a unity, subjectiveand objective. The organism is one life, controlling difference: and it isalso one by our effort to comprehend it. The Soul therefore is in Hegelianlanguage described as the Idea rather than the concept of the organicbody. Life is the generic title for this subject-object: but the life maybe merely physical, or it may be intellectual and practical, or it may beabsolute, i.e. will and know all that it is, and be all that it knows andwills."|FALSE
39064|"Up to this point the world is what is called an external, which is heretaken to mean (not a world external to the individual, but) aself-externalised world. That is to say, it is the observer who hashitherto by his interpretation of his perceptions supplied the “Spirit inNature.” In itself the external world has no inside, no centre: it is wewho read into it the conception of a life-history. We are led to believethat a principle of unity is always at work throughout the physicalworld—even in the mathematical laws of natural operation. It is onlyintelligible and credible to us as a system, a continuous and regulardevelopment. But that system is only a hypothetical idea, though it isheld to be a conclusion to which all the evidence seems unequivocally topoint. And, even in organic life, the unity, though more perfect andpalpable than in the mechanical and inorganic world, is only a perception,a vision,—a necessary mode of realising the unity of the facts. Thephenomenon of life reveals as in a picture and an ocular demonstration theconformity of inward and outward, the identity of whole and parts, ofpower and utterance. But it is still outside the observer. In the functionof sensibility and sentiency, however, we stand as it were on theborder-line between biology and psychology. At one step we have beenbrought within the harmony, and are no longer mere observers andreflecters. The sentient not merely is, but is aware that it is. Hithertoas life, it only is the unity in diversity, and diversity in unity, forthe outsider, i.e. only implicitly: now it is so for itself, orconsciously. And in the first stage it does not know, but feels or issentient. Here, for the first time, is created the distinction of inwardand outward. Loosely indeed we may, like Mr. Spencer, speak of outward andinward in physiology: but strictly speaking, what Goethe says is true,_Natur hat weder Kern noch Schaale_(73). Nature in the narrower senseknows no distinction of the inward and outward in its phenomena: it is apurely superficial order and succession of appearance and event. The Ideawhich has been visible to an intelligent percipient in the types and lawsof the natural world, now _is_, actually is—is in and for itself—but atfirst in a minimum of content, a mere point of light, or rather the dawnwhich has yet to expand into the full day."|FALSE

Yet it is well to remember thatthe abrupt and trenchant separations which popular practice loves areoverridden to a deeper view by an essential unity of idea, reducing themto indifference. If, that is, we take seriously the Spinozist unity ofSubstance, and the continual correlation (to call it no more) of extensionand consciousness therein, we cannot avoid the conclusion which even Baconwould admit of something describable as attraction and perception,something subduing diversity to unity. But whether it be well to name thissoul or life is a different matter. It may indeed only be taken to meanthat all true being must be looked on as a real unity and individuality,must, that is, be conceived as manifesting itself in organisation, must bereferred to a self-centred and self-developing activity. But this—which isthe fundamental thesis of idealism—is hardly all that is meant. RatherSpinoza would imply that all things which form a real unity must havelife—must have inner principle and unifying reality: and what he teachesis closely akin to the Leibnitian doctrine that every substantialexistence reposes upon a monad, a unity which is at once both a force anda cognition, a “representation” and an appetite or _nisus_ to act. WhenFechner in a series of works(75) expounds and defends the hypothesis thatplants and planets are not destitute of soul, any more than man andanimals, he only gives a more pronounced expression to this idealisationor spiritualisation of the natural world. But for the moment the point tobe noted is that all of this idealistic doctrine is an inference, or adevelopment which finds its _point d’appui_ in the fact of sensation. Andthe problem of the Philosophy of Mind is just to trace the process wherebya mere shock of sensation has grown into a conception and a faith in thegoodness, beauty and intelligence of the world."|FALSE

This organ, the brain and nervous system,causes the evolution into clear day of an element which has been growingmore and more urgent.

Neither of these points must belost sight of.

39064|"Soul, says Hegel, is not a separate and additional something over andabove the rest of nature: it is rather nature’s “’universal immaterialism,and simple ideal life(77).” There were ancient philosophers who spoke ofthe soul as a self-adjusting number,—as a harmony, or equilibrium(78)—andthe moderns have added considerably to the list of these analogicaldefinitions. As definitions they obviously fall short. Yet these thingsgive, as it were, by anticipation, an image of soul, as the “ideality,”which reduces the manifold to unity. The adhesions and cohesions ofmatter, its gravitating attractions, its chemical affinities andelectrical polarities, the intricate out-and-in of organic structure, areall preludes to the true incorporating unity which is the ever-immanentsupersession of the endless self-externalism and successionalism ofphysical reality. But in sentiency, feeling, or sensibility, the unitywhich all of these imply without reaching, is explicitly present. It isimplicitly an all-embracing unity: an infinite,—which has no doors and nowindows, for the good reason that it needs none, because it has nothingoutside it, because it “expresses” and “envelopes” (however confusedly atfirst) the whole universe. Thus, even if, with localising phraseology, wemay describe mind, where it _appears_ emerging in the natural world, as amere feeble and incidental outburst,—a rebellion breaking out as in somepetty province or isolated region against the great law of the physicalrealm—we are in so speaking taking only an external standpoint. But withthe rise of mind in nature the bond of externalism is implicitly overcome.To it, and where it really is, there is nothing outside, nothingtranscendent. Everything which is said to be outside mind is only outsidea localised and limited mind—outside a mind which is imperfectly andabstractly realised—not outside mind absolutely. Mind is the absolutenegation of externality: not a mere relative negative, as the organism maybe biologically described as inner in respect of the environment. Toaccomplish this negation in actuality, to bring the multiplicity andexternality of things into the unity and identity of one Idea, is theprocess of development of mind from animal sensibility to philosophicknowledge, from appetite to art,—the process of culture through the socialstate under the influence of religion."|FALSE

Yet science in these regions has no reason tobe dogmatic; her function hitherto can only be critical; and even forthat, her data are scanty and her principles extremely general. Theinfluences on the mental mood and faculty, produced by climate andseasons, by local environment and national type, by individualpeculiarities, by the differences of age and sex, and by the alternationof night and day, of sleep and waking, are less questionable. It is easyno doubt to ignore or forget them: easy to remark how indefinable andincalculable they are. But that does not lessen their radical andinevitable impress in the determination of the whole character. “The sumof our existence, divided by reason, never comes out exact, but alwaysleaves a marvellous remainder(80).” Irrational this residue is, in thesense that it is inexplicable, and incommensurable with the well-knownquantities of conscious and voluntarily organised life. But a scientificpsychology, which is adequate to the real and concrete mind, should neverlose sight of the fact that every one of its propositions in regard to themore advanced phases of intellectual development is thoroughly and inindefinable ways modified by these preconditions.

39064|"The first stage in mental development is the establishment of regular anduniform relations between soul and body: it is the differentiation oforgans and the integration of function: the balance between sensation andmovement, between the afferent and efferent processes of sensitivity.Given a potential soul, the problem is to make it actual in an individualbody. It is the business of a physical psychology to describe in detailthe steps by which the body we are attached to is made inward as our ideathrough the several organs and their nervous appurtenances: whereas apsychical physiology would conversely explain the corresponding processesfor the expression of the emotions and for the objectification of thevolitions. Thus soul inwardises (_erinnert_) or envelops body: which body“expresses” or develops soul. The actual soul is the unity of both, is thepercipient individual. The solidarity or “communion” of body and soul ishere the dominant fact: the soul sentient of changes in its peripheralorgans, and transmitting emotion and volition into physical effect. It ison this psychical unity,—the unity which is the soul of the diversity ofbody—that all the subsequent developments of mind rest. Sensation is thusthe _prius_—or basis—of all mental life: the organisation of soul in bodyand of body in soul. It is the process which historically has beenprepared in the evolution of animal life from those undifferentiated formswhere specialised organs are yet unknown, and which each individual hasfurther to realise and complete for himself, by learning to see and hear,and use his limbs. At first, moreover, it begins from many separatecentres and only through much collision and mutual compliance arrives atcomparative uniformity and centralisation. The common basis of unitedsensibility supplied by the one organism has to be made real andeffective, and it is so at first by sporadic and comparatively independentdevelopments. If self-hood means reference to self of what is prima facienot self, and projection of self therein, there is in primitivesensibility only the germ or possibility of self-hood. In the early phasesof psychic development the centre is fluctuating and ill-defined, and ittakes time and trouble to co-ordinate or unify the various starting-pointsof sensibility(81)."|FALSE

In the second case, it means a peculiar aggregate ofideas and sentiments.

It is the law of the natural will orcharacter which from an inaccessible background dominates ouraction,—which, because it is not realised and formulated in consciousness,behaves like a guardian spirit, or genius, or destiny within us. Thisgenius is the sub-conscious unity of the sensitive life—the manner of manwhich unknown to ourselves we are,—and which influences us against ournominal or formal purposes. So far as this predominates, our ends, roughhew them how we will, are given by a force which is not really, i.e. withfull consciousness, ours: by a mass of ingrained prejudice and unreasonedsympathies, of instincts and passions, of fancies and feelings, which havecondensed and organised themselves into a natural power. As the child inthe mother’s womb is responsive to her psychic influences, so thedevelopment of a man’s psychic life is guided by feelings centred inobjects and agents external to him, who form the genius presiding over hisdevelopment. His soul, to that extent, is really in another: he himself isselfless, and when his stay is removed the principle of his life isgone(82). He is but a bundle of impressions, held together by influencesand ties which in years before consciousness proper began made him what heis. Such is the involuntary adaptation to example and environment, whichestablishes in the depths below personality a self which becomes hereafterthe determinant of action. Early years, in which the human being isnaturally susceptible, build up by imitation, by pliant obedience, animage, a system, reproducing the immediate surroundings.

There is however another direction in whichcorresponding inquiries may be pursued; and where the danger of theconclusions arrived at, though not perhaps less real, is certainly of adifferent kind. In sociology we can observe—and almost experiment upon—thephenomena of the lapsed, degenerate and criminal classes. The advantage ofsuch observation is that the object of study can be made to throw greaterlight on his own inner states. He is a little of the child and a little ofthe savage, but these aspects co-exist with other features which put himmore on a level with the intelligent observer. Similar pathologicalregions are open to us in the case of psychology. There the anomalous andmorbid conditions of mind co-exist with a certain amount of matureconsciousness. So presented, they are thrown out into relief. They formthe negative instances which serve to corroborate our positive inductions.The regularly concatenated and solid structure of normal mind is underabnormal and deranged conditions thrown into disorder, and itsconstituents are presented in their several isolation.

Once in the whirlof spiritualist and crypto-psychical inquiry you could not tell how faryou might be carried. The facts moreover were of a peculiar type.Dependent as they seemed to be on the frame of mind of observers andobserved, they defied the ordinary criteria of detached and abstractobservation. You can only observe them, it is urged, when you believe;scepticism destroys them. Now there is a widespread natural impatienceagainst what Bacon has called “monodical” phenomena, phenomena i.e. whichclaim to come under a special law of their own, or to have a private andprivileged sphere. And this impatience cuts the Gordian knot by adetermination to treat all instances which oppose its hitherto ascertainedlaws as due to deception and fraud, or, at the best, to incompetentobservation, confusions of memory, and superstitions of ignorance. Aboveall, great interests of religion and personality seemed to connectthemselves with these revelations—interests, at any rate, to which ourcommon humanity thrills; it seemed as if, in this region beyond thecustomary range of the conscious and the seen, one might learn somethingof the deeper realities which lie in the unseen.

39064|"The philosophers were found—as might have been expected—amongst those moststrongly attracted by these problems. Even Kant had been fascinated by thespiritualism of Swedenborg, though he finally turned away sceptical. Atleast as early as 1806 Schelling had been interested by Ritter’sresearches into the question of telepathy, or the power of the human willto produce without mechanical means of conveyance an effect at a distance.He was looking forward to the rise of a _Physica coelestis_, or NewCelestial Physics, which should justify the old magic. About the same datehis brother Karl published an essay on Animal Magnetism. The novelphenomena of galvanism and its congeners suggested vast possibilities inthe range of the physical powers, especially of the physical powers of thehuman psyche as a natural agent.

This new force—mainly because of the recent interest in theremarkable advances of magnetic and electrical research—was conceived as afluid, and called Animal Magnetism. At one time indeed Mesmer actuallyemployed a magnet in the manipulation by which he induced the peculiarcondition in his patients. The accompaniments of his procedure were inmany respects those of the quack-doctor; and with the quack indeed he wasoften classed. A French commission of inquiry appointed to examine intohis performances reported in 1784 that, while there was no doubt as to thereality of many of the phenomena, and even of the cures, there was noevidence for the alleged new physical force, and declared the effects tobe mainly attributable to the influence of imagination.

The phenomena where they were discussed were studied andinterpreted in two directions. Some theorists, like Jung-Stilling,Eschenmayer, Schubert, and Kerner, took the more metaphysicist andspiritualistic view: they saw in them the witness to a higher truth, tothe presence and operation in this lower world of a higher and spiritualmatter, a so-called ether. Thus Animal Magnetism supplied a sort ofphysical theory of the other world and the other life. Jung-Stilling, e.g.in his “Theory of Spirit-lore.” (1808), regarded the spiritualisticphenomena as a justification of—what he believed to be—the Kantiandoctrine that in the truly real and persistent world space and time are nomore. The other direction of inquiry kept more to the physical field.Ritter (whose researches interested both Schelling and Hegel) supposed hehad detected the new force underlying mesmerism and the like, and gave toit the name of Siderism (1808); while Amoretti of Milan named the objectof his experiments Animal Electrometry (1816).

39064|"At a later date (1857) Schindler, in his “Magical Spirit-life,” expoundeda theory of mental polarity.

Either life hasa memory, a consciousness, a world of its own: and they flourish to alarge extent inversely to each other. The day-world has for its organs ofreceiving information the ordinary senses. But the magical or night-worldof the soul has its feelers also, which set men directly in telepathicrapport with influences, however distant, exerted by the whole world: andthrough this “inner sense” which serves to concentrate in itself all thetelluric forces (—a sense which in its various aspects we name instinct,presentiment, conscience) is constructed the fabric of our sub-conscioussystem. Through it man is a sort of résumé of all the cosmic life, insecret affinity and sympathy with all natural processes; and by the willwhich stands in response therewith he can exercise a directly creativeaction on external nature. In normal and healthy conditions the twocurrents of psychic life run on harmonious but independent. But in thephenomena of somnambulism, clairvoyance, and delirium, the magic regionbecomes preponderant, and comes into collision with the other. Thedark-world emerges into the realm of day as a portentous power: and thereis the feeling of a double personality, or of an indwelling genius,familiar spirit, or demon."|FALSE
39064|"To the ordinary physicist the so-called _Actio in distans_ was a hopelessstumbling-block. If he did not comprehend the transmission (as it iscalled) of force where there was immediate contact, he was at leastperfectly familiar with the outer aspect of it as a condition of hislimited experience. It needed one beyond the mere hodman of science to saywith Laplace: “We are so far from knowing all the agents of nature, thatit would be very unphilosophical to deny the existence of phenomena solelybecause they are inexplicable in the present state of our knowledge.”Accordingly mesmerism and its allied manifestations were generallyabandoned to the bohemians of science, and to investigators with dogmaticbias. It was still employed as a treatment for certain ailments: andphilosophers, as different as Fichte and Schopenhauer(86), watched itsfate with attention. But the herd of professional scientists fought shy ofit. The experiments of Braid at Manchester in 1841 gradually helped togive research into the subject a new character. Under the name ofHypnotism (or, rather at first Neuro-hypnotism) he described the phenomenaof the magnetic sleep (induced through prolonged staring at a brightobject), such as abnormal rigidity of body, perverted sensibility, and theremarkable obedience of the subject to the command or suggestions of theoperator. Thirty years afterwards, the matter became an object ofconsiderable experimental and theoretic work in France, at the rivalschools of Paris and Nancy; and the question, mainly under the title ofhypnotism, though the older name is still occasionally heard, has been forseveral years brought prominently under public notice."|FALSE
39064|"It cannot be said that the net results of these observations andhypotheses are of a very definitive character. While a large amount ofcontroversy has been waged on the comparative importance of the severalmethods and instruments by which the hypnotic or mesmeric trance may beinduced, and a scarcely less wide range of divergence prevails with regardto the physiological and pathological conditions in connexion with whichit has been most conspicuously manifested, there has been less anxietyshown to determine its precise psychical nature, or its significance inmental development. And yet the better understanding of these aspects maythrow light on several points connected with primitive religion and thehistory of early civilisation, indeed over the whole range of what iscalled _Völkerpsychologie_. Indeed this is one of the points which may besaid to emerge out of the confusion of dispute. Phenomena at leastanalogous to those styled hypnotic have a wide range in theanthropological sphere(87): and the proper characters which belong to themwill only be caught by an observer who examines them in the widest varietyof examples. Another feature which has been put in prominence is what hasbeen called “psychological automatism.” And in this name two points seemto deserve note. The first is the spontaneous and as it were mechanicalconsecution of mental states in the soul whence the interfering effect ofvoluntary consciousness has been removed. And the second is the unfailingor accurate regularity, so contrary to the hesitating and uncertainprocedure of our conscious and reasoned action, which so often is seen inthe unreflecting and unreasoned movements. To this invariable sequence ofpsychical movement the superior control and direction by the intelligentself has to adapt itself, just as it respects the order of physical laws."|FALSE
39064|"But, perhaps, the chief conclusion to be derived from hypnotic experienceis the value of suggestion or suggestibility. Even cool thinkers like Kanthave recognised how much mere mental control has to do with bodilystate,—how each of us, in this way, is often for good or for ill his ownphysician. An idea is a force, and is only inactive in so far as it isheld in check by other ideas. “There is no such thing as hypnotism,” saysone: “there are only different degrees of suggestibility.” This may be toexaggerate: yet it serves to impress the comparatively secondary characterof many of the circumstances on which the specially mesmeric or hypnoticexperimentalist is apt to lay exclusive stress. The methods may probablyvary according to circumstances. But the essence of them all is to get thepatient out of the general frame and system of ideas and perceptions inwhich his ordinary individuality is encased. Considering how for all of usthe reality of concrete life is bound up with our visual perceptions, howlargely our sanity depends upon the spatial idea, and how that depends onfree ocular range, we can understand that darkness and temporary loss ofvision are powerful auxiliaries in the hypnotic process, as in magical andsuperstitious rites. But a great deal short of this may serve to establishinfluence. The mind of the majority of human beings, but especially of theyoung, may be compared to a vacant seat waiting for some one to fill it."|FALSE
39064|"In Hegel’s view hypnotic phenomena produce a kind of temporary andartificial atavism. Mechanical or chemical means, or morbid conditions ofbody, may cause even for the intelligent adult a relapse into states ofmind closely resembling those exhibited by the primitive or the infantilesensibility. The intelligent personality, where powers are bound up withlimitations and operate through a chain of means and ends, is reduced toits primitively undifferentiated condition. Not that it is restored to itsinfantile simplicity; but that all subsequent acquirements operate only asa concentrated individuality, or mass of will and character, released fromthe control of the self-possessed mind, and invested (by the latter’swithdrawal) with a new quasi-personality of their own. With the loss ofthe world of outward things, there may go, it is supposed, a clearerperception of the inward and particularly of the organic life. The Soulcontains the form of unity which other experiences had impressed upon it:but this form avails in its subterranean existence where it creates a sortof inner self. And this inner self is no longer, like the embodied self ofordinary consciousness, an intelligence served by organs, and proceedingby induction and inference. Its knowledge is not mediated or carried alongspecific channels: it does not build up, piecemeal, by successive steps ofsynthesis and analysis, by gradual idealisation, the organised totality ofits intellectual world. The somnambulist and the clairvoyant see withouteyes, and carry their vision directly into regions where the wakingconsciousness of orderly intelligence cannot enter. But that region is notthe world of our higher ideas,—of art, religion, and philosophy. It isstill the sensitivity—that realm of sensitivity which is ordinarilycovered by unconsciousness. Such sensitive clairvoyants may, as it were,hear themselves growing; they may discern the hidden quivers and pulses ofblood and tissue, the seats of secret pain and all the unrevealed workingsin the dark chambers of the flesh. But always their vision seems confinedto that region, and will fall short of the world of light and ideal truth.It is towards the nature-bond of sensitive solidarity with earth, andflowers, and trees, the life that “rolls through all things,” not towardsthe spiritual unity which broods over the world and “impels all thinkingthings,” that these immersions in the selfless universe lead us."|FALSE
39064|"What Hegel chiefly sees in these phenomena is their indication, even onthe natural side of man, of that ideality of the material, which it is thework of intelligence to produce in the more spiritual life, in thefully-developed mind. The latter is the supreme over-soul, that AbsoluteMind which in our highest moods, aesthetic and religious, we approximateto. But mind, as it tends towards the higher end to “merge itself inlight,” to identify itself yet not wholly lost, but retained, in thefullness of undivided intellectual being, so at the lower end it springsfrom a natural and underlying unity, the immense solidarity ofnether-soul, the great Soul of Nature—the “Substance” which is to beraised into the “Subject” which is true divinity. Between these twounities, the nature-given nether-soul and the spirit-won over-soul, liesthe conscious life of man: a process of differentiation which narrows andof redintegration which enlarges,—which alternately builds up an isolatedpersonality and dissolves it in a common intelligence and sympathy. It isbecause mental or tacit “suggestion”(88) (i.e. will-influence exercisedwithout word or sign, or other sensible mode of connexion),thought-transference, or thought-reading (which is more than dexterousapprehension of delicate muscular signs), exteriorisation or transpositionof sensibility into objects primarily non-sensitive, clairvoyance (i.e.the power of describing, as if from direct perception, objects or eventsremoved in space beyond the recognised limits of sensation), andsomnambulism, so far as it implies lucid vision with sealed eyes,—it isbecause these things seem to show the essential ideality of matter, thatHegel is interested in them. The ordinary conditions of consciousness andeven of practical life in society are a derivative and secondary state; aproduct of processes of individualism, which however are never completed,and leave a large margin for idealising intelligence to fulfil. From astate which is not yet personality to a state which is more than can bedescribed as personality—lies the mental movement. So Fichte, too, hadregarded the power of the somnambulist as laying open a world underlyingthe development of egoity and self-consciousness(89): “the merely sensuousman is still in somnambulism,” only a somnambulism of waking hours: “thetrue waking is the life in God, to be free in him, all else is sleep anddream.” “Egoity,” he adds, “is a merely _formal_ principle, utterly, andnever qualitative (i.e. the essence and universal force).” ForSchopenhauer, too, the experiences of animal magnetism had seemed to provethe absolute supernatural power of the radical will in its superiority tothe intellectual categories of space, time, and causal sequence: to provethe reality of the metaphysical which is at the basis of all consciousdivisions."|FALSE

39064|"The result of the first range in the process of psycho-genesis was to makethe body a sign and utterance of the Soul, with a fixed and determinatetype. The “anthropological process” has defined and settled the meregeneral sentiency of soul into an individualised shape, a localised andlimited self, a bundle of habits. It has made the soul an Ego or self: apower which looks out upon the world as a spectator, lifted aboveimmanence in the general tide of being, but only so lifted because it hasmade itself one in the world of objects, a thing among things. The Mindhas reached the point of view of reflection. Instead of a generalidentifiability with all nature, it has encased itself in a limited range,from which it looks forth on what is now other than itself. If previouslyit was mere inward sensibility, it is now sense, perceptive of an objecthere and now, of an external world. The step has involved some price: andthat price is, that it has attained independence and self-hood at the costof surrendering the content it had hitherto held in one with itself. It isnow a blank receptivity, open to the impressions of an outside world: andthe changes which take place in its process of apprehension seem to it tobe given from outside. The world it perceives is a world of isolated andindependent objects: and it takes them as they are given. But a closerinsistance on the perception develops the implicit intelligence, whichmakes it possible. The percipient mind is no mere recipiency orsusceptibility with its forms of time and space: it is spontaneouslyactive, it is the source of categories, or is an apperceptive power,—anunderstanding. Consciousness, thus discovered to be a creative orconstructive faculty, is strictly speaking self-consciousness(90)."|FALSE
39064|"Self-consciousness appears at first in the selfish or narrowly egoisticform of appetite and impulse. The intelligence which claims to mould andconstrue the world of objects—which, in Kant’s phrase, professes to giveus nature—is implicitly the lord of that world. And that supremacy itcarries out as appetite—as destruction. The self is but a bundle ofwants—its supremacy over things is really subjection to them: thesatisfaction of appetite is baffled by a new desire which leaves it as itwas before. The development of self-consciousness to a more adequate shapeis represented by Hegel as taking place through the social struggle forexistence. Human beings, too, are in the first instance to theuninstructed appetite or the primitive self-consciousness (which is simplya succession of individual desires for satisfaction of natural want) onlythings,—adjectival to that self’s individual existence. To them, too, hisprimary relation is to appropriate and master them. Might precedes right.But the social struggle for existence forces him to recognise somethingother which is kindred to himself,—a limiting principle, another selfwhich has to form an element in his calculations, not to be neglected. Andgradually, we may suppose, the result is the division of humanity into twolevels, a ruling lordly class, and a class of slaves,—a state ofinequality in which each knows that his appetite is in some measurechecked by a more or less permanent other. Lastly, perhaps soonest in theinferior order, there is fashioned the perception that its self-seeking inits isolated appetites is subject to an abiding authority, a continuingconsciousness. There grows up a social self—a sense of general humanityand solidarity with other beings—a larger self with which each identifieshimself, a common ground. Understanding was selfish intelligence:practical in the egoistic sense. In the altruistic or universal sensepractical, a principle social and unifying character, intelligence isReason."|FALSE
39064|"Thus, Man, beginning as a percipient consciousness, apprehending singleobjects in space and time, and as an appetitive self bent upon singlegratifications, has ended as a rational being,—a consciousness purged ofits selfishness and isolation, looking forward openly and impartially onthe universe of things and beings. He has ceased to be a mere animal,swallowed up in the moment and the individual, using his intelligence onlyin selfish satisfactions. He is no longer bound down by the struggle forexistence, looking on everything as a mere thing, a mere means. He haserected himself above himself and above his environment, but that becausehe occupies a point of view at which he and his environment are no longerpurely antithetical and exclusive(91). He has reached what is really themoral standpoint: the point i.e. at which he is inspired by a universalself-consciousness, and lives in that peaceful world where the antithesesof individualities and of outward and inward have ceased to trouble. “Thenatural man,” says Hegel(92), “sees in the woman flesh of his flesh: themoral and spiritual man sees spirit of his spirit in the moral andspiritual being and by its means.” Hitherto we have been dealing withsomething falling below the full truth of mind: the region of immediatesensibility with its thorough immersion of mind in body, first of all, andsecondly its gradual progress to a general standpoint. It is only in thethird part of Subjective mind that we are dealing with the psychology of abeing who in the human sense knows and wills, i.e. apprehends generaltruth, and carries out ideal purposes."|FALSE

The basis of thought is an immediateperception—a sensuous affection or given something, and the basis of theidea of a general satisfaction is the natural claim to determine theoutward existence conformably to individual feeling. In intelligentperception or intuition the important factor is attention, which raises itabove mere passive acceptance and awareness of a given fact. Attentionthus involves on one hand the externality of its object, and on the otheraffirms its dependence on the act of the subject: it sets the objectsbefore and out of itself, in space and time, but yet in so doing it showsitself master of the objects. If perception presuppose attention, inshort, they cease to be wholly outward: we make them ours, and the spaceand time they fill are projected by us. So attended to, they areappropriated, inwardised and recollected: they take their place in amental place and mental time: they receive a general or de-individualisedcharacter in the memory-image. These are retained as mental property, butretained actually only in so far they are revivable and revived. Suchrevival is the work of imagination working by the so-called laws ofassociation. But the possession of its ideas thus inwardised andrecollected by the mind is largely a matter of chance. The mind is notreally fully master of them until it has been able to give them a certainobjectivity, by replacing the mental image by a vocal, i.e. a sensiblesign. By means of words, intelligence turns its ideas or representationsinto quasi-realities: it creates a sort of superior sense-world, the worldof language, where ideas live a potential, which is also an actual, life.Words are sensibles, but they are sensibles which completely losethemselves in their meaning. As sensibles, they render possible thatverbal memory which is the handmaid of thought: but which also as merelymechanical can leave thought altogether out of account. It is throughwords that thought is made possible: for it alone permits the movementthrough ideas without being distracted through a multitude ofassociations. In them thought has an instrument completely at its ownlevel, but still only a machine, and in memory the working of thatmachine. We think in names, not in general images, but in terms which onlyserve as vehicles for mental synthesis and analysis."|FALSE
39064|"It is as such a thinking being—a being who can use language, andmanipulate general concepts or take comprehensive views, that man is arational will. A concept of something to be done—a feeling even of someend more or less comprehensive in its quality, is the implication of whatcan be called will. At first indeed its material may be found asimmediately given and all its volitionality may lie in the circumstancethat the intelligent being sets this forward as a governing andcontrolling Ought. Its vehicle, in short, may be mere impulse, orinclination, and even passion: but it is the choice and the purposiveadoption of means to the given end. Gradually it attains to the idea of ageneral satisfaction, or of happiness. And this end seems positive anddefinite. It soon turns out however to be little but a prudent andself-denying superiority to particular passions and inclinations in theinterest of a comprehensive ideal. The free will or intelligence has sofar only a negative and formal value: it is the perfection of anautonomous and freely self-developing mind. Such a mind, which in languagehas acquired the means of realising an intellectual system of thingssuperior to the restrictions of sense, and which has emancipated reasonfrom the position of slave to inclination, is endued with the formalconditions of moral conduct. Such a mind will transform its own primarilyphysical dependence into an image of the law of reason and create theethical life: and in the strength of that establishment will go forth toconquer the world into a more and more adequate realisation of the eternalIdea."|FALSE

39064|"“In dealing,” says Hegel, “with the Idea of the State, we must not havebefore our eyes a particular state, or a particular institution: we mustrather study the Idea, this actual God, on his own account. Every State,however bad we may find it according to our principles, however defectivewe may discover this or that feature to be, still contains, particularlyif it belongs to the mature states of our time, all the essential factorsof its existence. But as it is easier to discover faults than tocomprehend the affirmative, people easily fall into the mistake of lettingindividual aspects obscure the intrinsic organism of the State itself. TheState is no ideal work of art: it stands in the everyday world, in thesphere, that is, of arbitrary act, accident, and error, and a variety offaults may mar the regularity of its traits. But the ugliest man, thecriminal, a sick man and a cripple, is after all a living man; theaffirmative, Life, subsists in spite of the defect: and this affirmativeis here the theme(93).” “It is the theme of philosophy,” he adds, “toascertain the substance which is immanent in the show of the temporal andtransient, and the eternal which is present.”"|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Hegel as a Political Critic."|FALSE
39064|"But if this is true, it is also to be remembered that the philosopher is,like other men, the son of his age, and estimates the value of realityfrom preconceptions and aspirations due to his generation. The historicalcircumstances of his nation as well as the personal experiences of hislife help to determine his horizon, even in the effort to discover thehidden pulse and movement of the social organism. This is speciallyobvious in political philosophy. The conception of ethics and politicswhich is presented in the _Encyclopaedia_ was in 1820 produced with moredetail as the _Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts_. Appearing, as itdid, two years after his appointment to a professorship at Berlin, and inthe midst of a political struggle between the various revolutionary andconservative powers and parties of Germany, the book became, and longremained, a target for embittered criticism. The so-called War ofLiberation or national movement to shake off the French yoke was due to acoalition of parties, and had naturally been in part supported bytendencies and aims which went far beyond the ostensive purpose either ofleaders or of combatants. Aspirations after a freer state were entwinedwith radical and socialistic designs to reform the political hierarchy ofthe Fatherland: high ideals and low vulgarities were closely intermixed:and the noble enthusiasm of youth was occasionally played on by criminaland anarchic intriguers. In a strong and wise and united Germany some ofthese schemes might have been tolerated. But strength, wisdom, and unitywere absent. In the existing tension between Austria and Prussia for theleadership, in the ill-adapted and effete constitutions of the severalprincipalities which were yet expected to realise the advance which hadtaken place in society and ideas during the last thirty years, the outlookon every hand seemed darker and more threatening than it might haveotherwise done. Governments, which had lost touch with their peoples,suspected conspiracy and treason: and a party in the nation credited theirrulers with gratuitous designs against private liberty and rights. Therewas a vast but ill-defined enthusiasm in the breasts of the younger world,and it was shared by many of their teachers. It seemed to their immenseaspirations that the war of liberation had failed of its true object andleft things much as they were. The volunteers had not fought for thepolitical systems of Austria or Prussia, or for the three-and-thirtyprinces of Germany: but for ideas, vague, beautiful, stimulating. To sucha mood the continuance of the old system was felt as a cruel deception anda reaction. The governments on their part had not realised the fullimportance of the spirit that had been aroused, and could not at amoment’s notice set their house in order, even had there been a cleareroutlook for reform than was offered. They too had suffered, and hadrealised their insecurity: and were hardly in a mood to open their gatesto the enemy."|FALSE
39064|"Coming on such a situation of affairs, Hegel’s book would have been likelyin any case to provoke criticism. For it took up a line of politicaltheory which was little in accord with the temper of the age. Theconception of the state which it expounded is not far removed inessentials from the conception which now dominates the political life ofthe chief European nations. But in his own time it came upon ears whichwere naturally disposed to misconceive it. It was unacceptable to theadherents of the _ancien régime_, as much as to the liberals. It wasdeclared by one party to be a glorification of the Prussian state: byanother to rationalise the sanctities of authority. It was pointed outthat the new professor was a favourite of the leading minister, that hisinfluence was dominant in scholastic appointments, and that occasionalgratuities from the crown proved his acceptability. A contemporaryprofessor, Fries, remarked that Hegel’s theory of the state had grown “notin the gardens of science but on the dung-hill of servility.” Hegelhimself was aware that he had planted a blow in the face of a “shallow andpretentious sect,” and that his book had “given great offence to thedemagogic folk.” Alike in religious and political life he was impatient ofsentimentalism, of rhetorical feeling, of wordy enthusiasm. A positivestorm of scorn burst from him at much-promising and little-containingdeclamation that appealed to the pathos of ideas, without sense of thecomplex work of construction and the system of principles which wereneeded to give them reality. His impatience of demagogic gush led him (inthe preface) into a tactless attack on Fries, who was at the moment indisgrace for his participation in the demonstration at the Wartburg. Itled him to an attack on the bumptiousness of those who held thatconscientious conviction was ample justification for any proceeding:—anattack which opponents were not unwilling to represent as directed againstthe principle of conscience itself."|FALSE
39064|"Yet Hegel’s views on the nature of political unity were not new. Theirnucleus had been formed nearly twenty years before. In the years thatimmediately followed the French revolution he had gone through the usualanarchic stage of intelligent youth. He had wondered whether humanitymight not have had a nobler destiny, had fate given supremacy to someheresy rather than the orthodox creed of Christendom. He had seen religionin the past “teaching what despotism wished,—contempt of the human race,its incapacity for anything good(94).” But his earliest reflections onpolitical power belong to a later date, and are inspired, not so much bythe vague ideals of humanitarianism, as by the spirit of nationalpatriotism. They are found in a “Criticism of the German Constitution”apparently dating from the year 1802(95). It is written after the peace ofLunéville had sealed for Germany the loss of her provinces west of theRhine, and subsequent to the disasters of the German arms at Hohenlindenand Marengo. It is almost contemporaneous with the measures of 1803 and1804, which affirmed the dissolution of the “Holy Roman Empire” of Germanname. The writer of this unpublished pamphlet sees his country in asituation almost identical with that which Macchiavelli saw around him inItaly. It is abused by petty despots, distracted by mean particularistambitions, at the mercy of every foreign power. It was such a scene which,as Hegel recalls, had prompted and justified the drastic measures proposedin the _Prince_,—measures which have been ill-judged by the closetmoralist, but evince the high statesmanship of the Florentine. In the_Prince_, an intelligent reader can see “the enthusiasm of patriotismunderlying the cold and dispassionate doctrines.” Macchiavelli dared todeclare that Italy must become a state, and to assert that “there is nohigher duty for a state than to maintain itself, and to punishrelentlessly every author of anarchy,—the supreme, and perhaps solepolitical crime.” And like teaching, Hegel adds, is needed for Germany.Only, he concludes, no mere demonstration of the insanity of utterseparation of the particular from his kin will ever succeed in convertingthe particularists from their conviction of the absoluteness of personaland private rights. “Insight and intelligence always excite so muchdistrust that force alone avails to justify them; then man yields themobedience(96).”"|FALSE
39064|"“The German political edifice,” says the writer, “is nothing else but thesum of the rights which the single parts have withdrawn from the whole;and this justice, which is ever on the watch to prevent the state havingany power left, is the essence of the constitution.” The Peace ofWestphalia had but served to constitute or stereotype anarchy: the Germanempire had by that instrument divested itself of all rights of politicalunity, and thrown itself on the goodwill of its members. What then, it maybe asked, is, in Hegel’s view, the indispensable minimum essential to astate? And the answer will be, organised strength,—a central and unitedforce. “The strength of a country lies neither in the multitude of itsinhabitants and fighting men, nor in its fertility, nor in its size, butsolely in the way its parts are by reasonable combination made a singlepolitical force enabling everything to be used for the common defence.”Hegel speaks scornfully of “the philanthropists and moralists who decrypolitics as an endeavour and an art to seek private utility at the cost ofright”: he tells them that “it is foolish to oppose the interest or (as itis expressed by the more morally-obnoxious word) the utility of the stateto its right”: that the “rights of a state are the utility of the state asestablished and recognised by compacts”: and that “war” (which they wouldfain abolish or moralise) “has to decide not which of the rights assertedby either party is the true right (—for both parties have a true right),but which right has to give way to the other.”"|FALSE
39064|"It is evident from these propositions that Hegel takes that view ofpolitical supremacy which has been associated with the name of Hobbes. Buthis views also reproduce the Platonic king of men, “who can rule and darenot lie.” “All states,” he declares, “are founded by the sublime force ofgreat men, not by physical strength. The great man has something in hisfeatures which others would gladly call their lord. They obey him againsttheir will. Their immediate will is his will, but their conscious will isotherwise.... This is the prerogative of the great man to ascertain and toexpress the absolute will. All gather round his banner. He is their God.”“The state,” he says again, “is the self-certain absolute mind whichrecognises no definite authority but its own: which acknowledges noabstract rules of good and bad, shameful and mean, craft and deception.”So also Hobbes describes the prerogatives of the sovereign Leviathan. Butthe Hegelian God immanent in the state is a higher power than Hobbesknows: he is no mortal, but in his truth an immortal God. He speaks by(what in this early essay is called) the Absolute Government(97): thegovernment of the Law—the true impersonal sovereign,—distinct alike fromthe single ruler and the multitude of the ruled. “It is absolutely onlyuniversality as against particular. As this absolute, ideal, universal,compared to which everything else is a particular, it is the phenomenon ofGod. Its words are his decision, and it can appear and exist under noother form.... The Absolute government is divine, self-sanctioned and notmade(98).” The real strength—the real connecting-mean which gives life tosovereign and to subject—is intelligence free and entire, independent bothof what individuals feel and believe and of the quality of the ruler. “Thespiritual bond,” he says in a lower form of speech, “is public opinion: itis the true legislative body, national assembly, declaration of theuniversal will which lives in the execution of all commands.” This stillsmall voice of public opinion is the true and real parliament: notliterally making laws, but revealing them. If we ask, where does thispublic opinion appear and how does it disengage itself from the masses ofpartisan judgment? Hegel answers,—and to the surprise of those who havenot entered into the spirit of his age(99)—it is embodied in the Aged andthe Priests. Both of these have ceased to live in the real world: they areby nature and function disengaged from the struggles of particularexistence, have risen above the divergencies of social classes. Theybreathe the ether of pure contemplation. “The sunset of life gives themmystical lore,” or at least removes from old age the distraction ofselfishness: while the priest is by function set apart from the divisionsof human interest. Understood in a large sense, Hegel’s view is that thereal voice of experience is elicited through those who have attainedindifference to the distorting influence of human parties, and who seelife steadily and whole."|FALSE
39064|"If this utterance shows the little belief Hegel had in the ordinarymethods of legislation through “representative” bodies, and hints that thereal _substance_ of political life is deeper than the overt machinery ofpolitical operation, it is evident that this theory of “divine right” isof a different stamp from what used to go under that name. And, again,though the power of the central state is indispensable, he is far fromagreeing with the so-called bureaucratic view that “a state is a machinewith a single spring which sets in motion all the rest of the machinery.”“Everything,” he says, “which is not directly required to organise andmaintain the force for giving security without and within must be left bythe central government to the freedom of the citizens. Nothing ought to beso sacred in the eyes of a government as to leave alone and to protect,without regard to utilities, the free action of the citizens in suchmatters as do not affect its fundamental aim: for this freedom is itselfsacred(100).” He is no friend of paternal bureaucracy. “The pedanticcraving to settle every detail, the mean jealousy against estates andcorporations administrating and directing their own affairs, the basefault-finding with all independent action on the part of the citizens,even when it has no immediate bearing on the main political interest, hasbeen decked out with reasons to show that no penny of public expenditure,made for a country of twenty or thirty millions’ population, can be laidout, without first being, not permitted, but commanded, controlled andrevised by the supreme government.” You can see, he remarks, in the firstvillage after you enter Prussian territory the lifeless and wooden routinewhich prevails. The whole country suffers also from the way religion hasbeen mixed up with political rights, and a particular creed pronounced bylaw indispensable both for sovereign and full-privileged subject. In aword, the unity and vigour of the state is quite compatible withconsiderable latitude and divergence in laws and judicature, in theimposition and levying of taxes, in language, manners, civilisation andreligion. Equality in all these points is desirable for social unity: butit is not indispensable for political strength."|FALSE
39064|"This decided preference for the unity of the state against the system ofchecks and counterchecks, which sometimes goes by the name of aconstitution, came out clearly in Hegel’s attitude in discussing thedispute between the Würtembergers and their sovereign in 1815-16.Würtemberg, with its complicated aggregation of local laws, had alwaysbeen a paradise of lawyers, and the feudal rights or privileges of thelocal oligarchies—the so-called “good old law”—were the boast of thecountry. All this had however been aggravated by the increase of territoryreceived in 1805: and the king, following the examples set by France andeven by Bavaria, promulgated of his own grace a “constitution” remodellingthe electoral system of the country. Immediately an outcry burst outagainst the attempt to destroy the ancient liberties. Uhland tuned hislyre to the popular cry: Rückert sang on the king’s side. To Hegel thecontest presented itself as a struggle between the attachment totraditional rights, merely because they are old, and the resolution tocarry out reasonable reform whether it be agreeable to the reformed ornot: or rather he saw in it resistance of particularism, of separation,clinging to use and wont, and basing itself on formal pettifoggingobjections, against the spirit of organisation. Anything more he declinedto see. And probably he was right in ascribing a large part of theopposition to inertia, to vanity and self-interest, combined with the wantof political perception of the needs of Würtemberg and Germany. But on theother hand, he failed to remember the insecurity and danger of such “giftsof the Danai”: he forgot the sense of free-born men that a constitution isnot something to be granted (_octroyé_) as a grace, but something thatmust come by the spontaneous act of the innermost self of the community.He dealt rather with the formal arguments which were used to refuseprogress, than with the underlying spirit which prompted theopposition(101)."|FALSE

Bent on the essential nucleus of institutions, heattaches but slight importance to the variety of externals, and fails torealise the practice of the law-courts.

Forfeeling and sentiment he has but scant respect: he is brusque anduncompromising: and cannot realise all the difficulties and dangers thatbeset the Idea in the mazes of the world, and may ultimately quite alter aplan which at first seemed independent of petty details. Better than othermen perhaps he recognises in theory how the mere universal only existscomplete in an individual shape: but more than other men he forgets thesetruths of insight, when the business of life calls for action or forjudgment.

39064|"This idealism of political theory is illustrated by the sketch of theEthical Life which he drew up about 1802. Under the name of “EthicalSystem” it presents in concentrated or undeveloped shape the doctrinewhich subsequently swelled into the “Philosophy of Mind.” At a later datehe worked out more carefully as introduction the psychological genesis ofmoral and intelligent man, and he separated out more distinctly as asequel the universal powers which give to social life its highercharacters. In the earlier sketch the Ethical Part stands by itself, withthe consequence that Ethics bears a meaning far exceeding all that hadbeen lately called moral. The word “moral” itself he avoids(102). Itsavours of excessive subjectivity, of struggle, of duty and conscience. Ithas an ascetic ring about it—an aspect of negation, which seeks forabstract holiness, and turns its back on human nature. Kant’s wordsopposing duty to inclination, and implying that moral goodness involves astruggle, an antagonism, a victory, seem to him (and to his time)one-sided. That aspect of negation accordingly which Kant certainly beganwith, and which Schopenhauer magnified until it became the all-in-all ofEthics, Hegel entirely subordinates. Equally little does he like theemphasis on the supremacy of insight, intention, conscience: they lead, hethinks, to a view which holds the mere fact of conviction to beall-important, as if it mattered not what we thought and believed and did,so long as we were sincere in our belief. All this emphasis on thegood-will, on the imperative of duty, on the rights of conscience, has, headmits, its justification in certain circumstances, as against merelegality, or mere natural instinctive goodness; but it has been overdone.Above all, it errs by an excess of individualism. It springs from anattitude of reflection,—in which the individual, isolated in his consciousand superficial individuality, yet tries—but probably tries in vain—to getsomewhat in touch with a universal which he has allowed to slip outsidehim, forgetting that it is the heart and substance of his life. Kant,indeed, hardly falls under this condemnation. For he aims at showing thatthe rational will inevitably creates as rational a law or universal; thatthe individual act becomes self-regulative, and takes its part inconstituting a system or realm of duty."|FALSE
39064|"Still, on the whole, “morality” in this narrower sense belongs to an ageof reflection, and is formal or nominal goodness rather than the genuineand full reality. It is the protest against mere instinctive or customaryvirtue, which is but compliance with traditional authority, and compliancewith it as if it were a sort of quasi-natural law. Moralising reflectionis the awakening of subjectivity and of a deeper personality. The agewhich thus precedes morality is not an age in which kindness, or love, orgenerosity is unknown. And if Hegel says that “Morality,” strictly socalled, began with Socrates, he does not thereby accuse the pre-SocraticGreeks of inhumanity. But what he does say is that such ethical life asexisted was in the main a thing of custom and law: of law, moreover, whichwas not set objectively forward, but left still in the stage ofuncontradicted usage, a custom which was a second nature, part of theessential and quasi-physical ordinance of life. The individual had not yetlearned to set his self-consciousness against these usages and ask fortheir justification. These are like the so-called law of the Medes andPersians which alters not: customs of immemorial antiquity andunquestionable sway. They are part of a system of things with which forgood or evil the individual is utterly identified, bound as it were handand foot. These are, as a traveller says(103), “oral and unwrittentraditions which teach that certain rules of conduct are to be observedunder certain penalties; and without the aid of fixed records, or theintervention of a succession of authorised depositaries and expounders,these laws have been transmitted to father and son, through unknowngenerations, and are fixed in the minds of the people as sacred andunalterable.”"|FALSE
39064|"The antithesis then in Hegel, as in Kant, is between Law and Morality, orrather Legality and Morality,—two abstractions to which human developmentis alternately prone to attach supreme importance. The first stage in theobjectivation of intelligence or in the evolution of personality is theconstitution of mere, abstract, or strict right. It is the creation ofinstitutions and uniformities, i.e. of laws, or rights, which expressdefinite and stereotyped modes of behaviour. Or, if we look at it from theindividual’s standpoint, we may say his consciousness awakes to find theworld parcelled out under certain rules and divisions, which haveobjective validity, and govern him with the same absolute authority as dothe circumstances of physical nature. Under their influence every rank andindividual is alike forced to bow: to each his place and function isassigned by an order or system which claims an inviolable and eternalsupremacy. It is not the same place and function for each: but for eachthe position and duties are predetermined in this metaphysically-physicalorder. The situation and its duties have been created by super-human andnatural ordinance. As the Platonic myth puts it, each order in the socialhierarchy has been framed underground by powers that turned out men ofgold, and silver, and baser metal: or as the Norse legend tells, they arethe successive offspring of the white God, Heimdal, in his dealings withwomankind."|FALSE
39064|"The central idea of the earlier social world is the supremacy ofrights—but not of right. The sum (for it cannot be properly called asystem) of rights is a self-subsistent world, to which man is but aservant; and a second peculiarity of it is its inequality. If all areequal before the laws, this only means here that the laws, with theirabsolute and thorough inequality, are indifferent to the real and personaldiversities of individuals. Even the so-called equality of primitive lawis of the “Eye-for-eye, Tooth-for-tooth” kind; it takes no note of specialcircumstances; it looks abstractly and rudely at facts, and maintains ahard and fast uniformity, which seems the height of unfairness. Rulestands by rule, usage beside usage,—a mere aggregate or multitude of pettytyrants, reduced to no unity or system, and each pressing with all theweight of an absolute mandate. The pettiest bit of ceremonial law is hereof equal dignity with the most far-reaching principle of politicalobligation."|FALSE
39064|"In the essay already referred to, Hegel has designated something analogousto this as Natural or Physical Ethics, or as Ethics in its relative orcomparative stage. Here Man first shows his superiority to nature, orenters on his properly ethical function, by transforming the physicalworld into his possession. He makes himself the lord of naturalobjects—stamping them as his, and not their own, making them his permanentproperty, his tools, his instruments of exchange and production. Thefundamental ethical act is appropriation by labour, and the first ethicalworld is the creation of an economic system, the institution of property.For property, or at least possession and appropriation, is the dominantidea, with its collateral and sequent principles. And at first, even humanbeings are treated on the same method as other things: as objects in aworld of objects or aggregate of things: as things to be used andacquired, as means and instruments,—not in any sense as ends inthemselves. It is a world in which the relation of master and slave isdominant,—where owner and employer is set in antithesis against his toolsand chattels. But the Nemesis of his act issues in making the individualthe servant of his so-called property. He has become an objective power bysubmitting himself to objectivity: he has literally put himself into theobject he has wrought, and is now a thing among things: for what he owns,what he has appropriated, determines what he is. The real powers in theworld thus established are the laws of possession-holding: the lawsdominate man: and he is only freed from dependence on casual externals, bymaking himself thoroughly the servant of his possessions."|FALSE
39064|"The only salvation, and it is but imperfect, that can be reached on thisstage is by the family union. The sexual tie, is at first entirely on alevel with the other arrangements of the sphere. The man or woman is but achattel and a tool; a casual appropriation which gradually is transformedinto a permanent possession and a permanent bond(104). But, as the familyconstituted itself, it helped to afford a promise of better things. Anideal interest—the religion of the household—extending beyond theindividual, and beyond the moment,—binding past and present, and parentsto offspring, gave a new character to the relation of property. Parentsand children form a unity, which overrides and essentially permeates their“difference” from each other: there is no exchange, no contract, nor, inthe stricter sense, property between the members. In the property-ideathey are lifted out of their isolation, and in the continuity of familylife there is a certain analogue of immortality. But, says Hegel, “thoughthe family be the highest totality of which Nature is capable, theabsolute identity is in it still inward, and is not instituted in absoluteform; and hence, too, the reproduction of the totality is an appearance,the appearance of the children(105).” “The power and the intelligence, the‘difference’ of the parents, stands in inverse proportion to the youth andvigour of the child: and these two sides of life flee from and are sequenton each other, and are reciprocally external(106).” Or, as we may put it,the god of the family is a departed ancestor, a ghost in the land of thedead: it has not really a continuous and unified life. In such a state ofsociety—a state of nature—and in its supreme form, the family, there is noadequate principle which though real shall still give ideality and unityto the self-isolating aspects of life. There is wanted something whichshall give expression to its “indifference,” which shall control thetendency of this partial moralisation to sink at every moment intoindividuality, and lift it from its immersion in nature. Family life andeconomic groups (—for these two, which Hegel subsequently separates, arehere kept close together) need an ampler and wider life to keep them fromstagnating in their several selfishnesses."|FALSE
39064|"This freshening and corrective influence they get in the first instancefrom deeds of violence and crime. Here is the “negative unsettling” of thenarrow fixities, of the determinate conditions or relationships into whichthe preceding processes of labour and acquisition have tended tostereotype life. The harsh restriction brings about its own undoing. Manmay subject natural objects to his formative power, but the wild rage ofsenseless devastation again and again bursts forth to restore the originalformlessness. He may build up his own pile of wealth, store up his privategoods, but the thief and the robber with the instincts of barbariansocialism tread on his steps: and every stage of appropriation has for itssequel a crop of acts of dispossession. He may secure by accumulation hisfuture life; but the murderer for gain’s sake cuts it short. And out ofall this as a necessary consequence stands avenging justice. And in thenatural world of ethics—where true moral life has not yet arisen—this ismere retaliation or the _lex talionis_;—the beginning of an endless seriesof vengeance and counter-vengeance, the blood-feud. Punishment, in thestricter sense of the term,—which looks both to antecedents and effects incharacter—cannot yet come into existence; for to punish there must besomething superior to individualities, an ethical idea embodied in aninstitution, to which the injurer and the injured alike belong. But as yetpunishment is only vengeance, the personal and natural equivalent, thephysical reaction against injury, perhaps regulated and formulated bycustom and usage, but not essentially altered from its purely retaliatorycharacter. These crimes—or transgressions—are thus by Hegel quaintlyconceived as storms which clear the air—which shake the individualist outof his slumber. The scene in which transgression thus acts is that of theso-called state of nature, where particularism was rampant: where moralright was not, but only the right of nature, of pre-occupation, of thestronger, of the first maker and discoverer. Crime is thus the “dialectic”which shakes the fixity of practical arrangements, and calls for somethingin which the idea of a higher unity, a permanent substance of life, shallfind realisation."|FALSE
39064|"The “positive supersession(107)” of individualism and naturalism in ethicsis by Hegel called “Absolute Ethics.” Under this title he describes theethics and religion of the state—a religion which is immanent in thecommunity, and an ethics which rises superior to particularity. Thepicture he draws is a romance fashioned upon the model of the Greekcommonwealth as that had been idealised by Greek literature and by thelongings of later ages for a freer life. It is but one of the many modesin which Helena—to quote Goethe—has fascinated the German Faust. He dreamshimself away from the prosaic worldliness of a German municipality to theunfading splendour of the Greek city with its imagined coincidence ofindividual will with universal purpose. There is in such a commonwealth nopain of surrender and of sacrifice, and no subsequent compensation: for,at the very moment of resigning self-will to common aims, he enjoys itretained with the added zest of self-expansion. He is not so left tohimself as to feel from beyond the restraint of a law which controls—evenif it wisely and well controls—individual effort. There is for his happycircumstances no possibility of doing otherwise. Or, it may be, Hegel hasreminiscences from the ideals of other nations than the Greek. He recallsthe Israelite depicted by the Law-adoring psalmist, whose delight is to dothe will of the Lord, whom the zeal of God’s house has consumed, whosewhole being runs on in one pellucid stream with the universal and eternalstream of divine commandment. Such a frame of spirit, where the empiricalconsciousness with all its soul and strength and mind identifies itsmission into conformity with the absolute order, is the mood of absoluteEthics. It is what some have spoken of as the True life, as the Eternallife; in it, says Hegel, the individual exists _auf ewige Weise_(108), asit were _sub specie aeternitatis_: his life is hid with his fellows in thecommon life of his people. His every act, and thought, and will, get theirbeing and significance from a reality which is established in him as apermanent spirit. It is there that he, in the fuller sense, attainsαὐτάρκεια, or finds himself no longer a mere part, but an ideal totality.This totality is realised under the particular form of a Nation (_Volk_),which in the visible sphere represents (or rather is, as a particular) theabsolute and infinite. Such a unity is neither the mere sum of isolatedindividuals, nor a mere majority ruling by numbers: but the fraternal andorganic commonwealth which brings all classes and all rights from theirparticularistic independence into an ideal identity and indifference(109).Here all are not merely equal before the laws: but the law itself is aliving and organic unity, self-correcting, subordinating and organising,and no longer merely defining individual privileges and so-calledliberties. “In such conjunction of the universal with the particularitylies the divinity of a nation: or, if we give this universal a separateplace in our ideas, it is the God of the nation.” But in this completeaccordance between concept and intuition, between visible and invisible,where symbol and significate are one, religion and ethics areindistinguishable. It is the old conception (and in its highest sense) ofTheocracy(110). God is the national head and the national life: and in himall individuals have their “difference” rendered “indifferent.” “Such anethical life is absolute truth, for untruth is only in the fixture of asingle mode: but in the everlasting being of the nation all singleness issuperseded. It is absolute culture; for in the eternal is the real andempirical annihilation and prescription of all limited modality. It isabsolute disinterestedness: for in the eternal there is nothing privateand personal. It, and each of its movements, is the highest beauty: forbeauty is but the eternal made actual and given concrete shape. It iswithout pain, and blessed: for in it all difference and all pain issuperseded. It is the divine, absolute, real, existing and being, under noveil; nor need one first raise it up into the ideality of divinity, andextract it from the appearance and empirical intuition; but it is, andimmediately, absolute intuition(111).”"|FALSE
39064|"If we compare this language with the statement of the Encyclopaedia we cansee how for the moment Hegel’s eye is engrossed with the glory of theideal nation. In it, the moral life embraces and is co-extensive withreligion, art and science: practice and theory are at one: life in theidea knows none of those differences which, in the un-ideal world, makeart and morality often antithetical, and set religion at variance withscience. It is, as we have said, a memory of Greek and perhaps Hebrewideals. Or rather it is by the help of such memories the affirmation ofthe essential unity of life—the true, complete, many-sided life—which isthe presupposition and idea that culture and morals rest upon and fromwhich they get their supreme sanction, i.e. their constitutive principleand unity. Even in the Encyclopaedia(112) Hegel endeavours to guardagainst the severance of morality and art and philosophy which may berashly inferred in consequence of his serial order of treatment.“Religion,” he remarks, “is the very substance of the moral life itselfand of the state.... The ethical life is the divine spirit indwelling inconsciousness, as it is actually present in a nation and its individualmembers.” Yet, as we see, there is a distinction. The process of historycarries out a judgment on nation after nation, and reveals the divine asnot only immanent in the ethical life but as ever expanding the limitednational spirit till it become a spirit of universal humanity. Still—andthis is perhaps for each time always the more important—the nationalunity—not indeed as a multitude, nor as a majority—is the supreme realappearance of the Eternal and Absolute."|FALSE
39064|"Having thus described the nation as an organic totality, he goes on topoint out that the political constitution shows this character by forminga triplicity of political orders. In one of these there is but a silent,practical identity, in faith and trust, with the totality: in the secondthere is a thorough disruption of interest into particularity: and in thethird, there is a living and intellectual identity or indifference, whichcombines the widest range of individual development with the completestunity of political loyalty. This last order is that which lives inconscious identification of private with public duty: all that it does hasa universal and public function. Such a body is the ideal Nobility—thenobility which is the _servus servorum Dei_, the supreme servant ofhumanity. Its function is to maintain general interests, to give the otherorders (peasantry and industrials) security,—receiving in return fromthese others the means of subsistence. _Noblesse oblige_ gives thedeath-blow to particular interests, and imposes the duty of exhibiting, inthe clearest form, the supreme reality of absolute morality, and of beingto the rest an unperturbed ideal of aesthetic, ethical, religious, andphilosophical completeness."|FALSE
39064|"It is here alone, in this estate which is absolutely disinterested, thatthe virtues appear in their true light. To the ordinary moralisingstandpoint they seem severally to be, in their separation, charged withindependent value. But from the higher point of view the existence, andstill more the accentuation of single virtues, is a mark ofincompleteness. Even quality, it has been said, involves its defects: itcan only shine by eclipsing or reflecting something else. The completelymoral is not the sum of the several virtues, but the reduction of them toindifference. It is thus that when Plato tries to get at the unity ofvirtue, their aspect of difference tends to be subordinated. “The movementof absolute morality runs through all the virtues, but settles fixedly innone.” It is more than love _to_ fatherland, and nation, and laws:—thatstill implies a relation to something and involves a difference. Forlove—the mortal passion, where “self is not annulled”—is the process ofapproximation, while unity is not yet attained, but wished and aimed at:and when it is complete—and become “such love as spirits know(113)”—itgives place to a calmer rest and an active immanence. The absolutemorality is _life in_ the fatherland and for the nation. In the individualhowever it is the process upward and inward that we see, not theconsummation. Then the identity appears as an ideal, as a tendency not yetaccomplished to its end, a possibility not yet made fully actual. Atbottom—in the divine substance in which the individual inheres—theidentity is present: but in the appearance, we have only the passage frompossible to actual, a passage which has the aspect of a struggle. Hencethe moral act appears as a virtue, with merit or desert. It is accordinglythe very characteristic of virtue to signalise its own incompleteness: itemerges into actuality only through antagonism, and with a taint ofimperfection clinging to it. Thus, in the field of absolute morality, ifthe virtues appear, it is only in their transiency. If they wereundisputedly real in morality, they would not separately show. To feelthat you have done well implies that you have not done wholly well:self-gratulation in meritorious deed is the re-action from the shudder atfeeling that the self was not wholly good."|FALSE
39064|"The essential unity of virtue—its negative character as regards all theempirical variety of virtues—is seen in the excellences required by theneeds of war. These military requirements demonstrate the mere relativityand therefore non-virtuousness of the special virtues. They equallyprotest against the common beliefs in the supreme dignity of labour andits utilities. But if bravery or soldierlike virtue be essentially avirtue of virtues, it is only a negative virtue after all. It is the blastof the universal sweeping away all the habitations and fixed structures ofparticularist life. If it is a unity of virtue, it is only a negativeunity—an indifference. If it avoid the parcelling of virtue into a numberof imperfect and sometimes contradictory parts, it does so only to presenta bare negation. The soldier, therefore, if in potentiality the unity ofall the virtues, may tend in practice to represent the ability to dowithout any of them(114)."|FALSE
39064|"The home of these “relative” virtues—of morality in the ordinary sense—isthe life of the second order in the commonwealth: the order of industryand commerce. In this sphere the idea of the universal is gradually lostto view: it becomes, says Hegel, only a thought or a creature of the mind,which does not affect practice. The materialistic worker of civilisationdoes not see further than the empirical existence of individuals: hishorizon is limited by the family, and his final ideal is a competency ofcomfort in possessions and revenues. The supreme universal to which heattains as the climax of his evolution is only money. But it is only withthe vaster development of commerce that this terrible consequence ensues.At first as a mere individual, he has higher aims, though not the highest.He has a limited ideal determined by his special sphere of work. To winrespect—the character for a limited truthfulness and honesty and skilfulwork—is his ambition. He lives in a conceit of his performance—hisutility—the esteem of his special circle. To his commercial soul themilitary order is a scarecrow and a nuisance: military honour is buttrash. Yet if his range of idea is narrow and engrossing in details, hisaim is to get worship, to be recognised as the best in his little sphere.But with the growth of the trading spirit his character changes: hebecomes the mere capitalist, is denationalised, has no definite work andcan claim no individualised function. Money now measures all things: it isthe sole ultimate reality. It transforms everything into a relation ofcontract: even vengeance is equated in terms of money. Its motto is, TheExchanges must be honoured, though honour and morality may go to the dogs.So far as it is concerned, there is no nation, but a federation ofshopkeepers. Such an one is the _bourgeois_ (the _Bürger_, as distinctfrom the peasant or _Bauer_ and the _Adel_). As an artisan—i.e. a mereindustrial, he knows no country, but at best the reputation and interestof his own guild-union with its partial object. He is narrow, but honestand respectable. As a mere commercial agent, he knows no country: hisfield is the world, but the world not in its concreteness and variety, butin the abstract aspect of a money-bag and an exchange. The larger totalityis indeed not altogether out of sight. But if he contribute to the needy,either his sacrifice is lifeless in proportion as it becomes general, orloses generality as it becomes lively. As regards his general services tothe great life of his national state(115), they are unintelligently andperhaps grudgingly rendered."|FALSE
39064|"Of the peasant order Hegel has less to say. On one side the “country” asopposed to the “town” has a closer natural sympathy with the common andgeneral interest: and the peasantry is the undifferentiated, solid andsound, basis of the national life. It forms the submerged mass, out ofwhich the best soldiers are made, and which out of the depths of earthbrings forward nourishment as well as all the materials of elementarynecessity. Faithfulness and loyalty are its virtues: but it is personalallegiance to a commanding superior,—not to a law or a general view—forthe peasant is weak in comprehensive intelligence, though shrewd indetailed observation."|FALSE
39064|"Of the purely political function of the state Hegel in this sketch saysalmost nothing. But under the head of the general government of the statehe deals with its social functions. For a moment he refers to thewell-known distinction of the legislative, judicial and executive powers.But it is only to remark that “in every governmental act all three areconjoined. They are abstractions, none of which can get a reality of itsown,—which, in other words, cannot be constituted and organised as powers.Legislation, judicature, and executive are something completely formal,empty, and contentless.... Whether the others are or are not bareabstractions, empty activities, depends entirely on the executive power;and this is absolutely the government(116).” Treating government as theorganic movement by which the universal and the particular in thecommonwealth come into relations, he finds that it presents three forms,or gives rise to three systems. The highest and last of these is the“educational” system. By this he understands all that activity by whichthe intelligence of the state tries directly to mould and guide thecharacter and fortunes of its members: all the means of culture anddiscipline, whether in general or for individuals, all training to publicfunction, to truthfulness, to good manners. Under the same head comeconquest and colonisation as state agencies. The second system is thejudicial, which instead of, like the former, aiming at the formation orreformation of its members is satisfied by subjecting individualtransgression to a process of rectification by the general principle. Withregard to the system of judicature, Hegel argues for a variety ofprocedure to suit different ranks, and for a corresponding modification ofpenalties. “Formal rigid equality is just what does not spare thecharacter. The same penalty which in one estate brings no infamy causes inanother a deep and irremediable hurt.” And with regard to the after lifeof the transgressor who has borne his penalty: “Punishment is thereconciliation of the law with itself. No further reproach for his crimecan be addressed to the person who has undergone his punishment. He isrestored to membership of his estate(117).”"|FALSE
39064|"In the first of the three systems, the economic system, or “System ofwants,” the state seems at first hardly to appear in its universal andcontrolling function at all. Here the individual depends for thesatisfaction of his physical needs on a blind, unconscious destiny, on theobscure and incalculable properties of supply and demand in the wholeinterconnexion of commodities. But even this is not all. With theaccumulation of wealth in inequality, and the growth of vast capitals,there is substituted for the dependence of the individual on the generalresultant of a vast number of agencies a dependence on one enormously richindividual, who can control the physical destinies of a nation. But anation, truly speaking, is there no more. The industrial order has partedinto a mere abstract workman on one hand, and the _grande richesse_ on theother. “It has lost its capacity of an organic absolute intuition and ofrespect for the divine—external though its divinity be: and there sets inthe bestiality of contempt for all that is noble. The mere wisdomlessuniversal, the mass of wealth, is the essential: and the ethicalprinciple, the absolute bond of the nation, is vanished; and the nation isdissolved(118).”"|FALSE

The knowledge it commandsmeans that of man’s genuine reality—of what is essentially and ultimatelytrue and real—of mind as the true and essential being. Equally little isit the purport of mental philosophy to teach what is called _knowledge ofmen_—the knowledge whose aim is to detect the _peculiarities_, passions,and foibles of other men, and lay bare what are called the recesses of thehuman heart. Information of this kind is, for one thing, meaningless,unless on the assumption that we know the _universal_—man as man, and,that always must be, as mind.

In this way it came aboutthat the metaphysical theory was kept outside the inductive science, andso prevented from getting any concrete embodiment or detail: whilst at thesame time the inductive science clung to the conventional common-sensemetaphysic, with its analysis into forces, various activities, &c., andrejected any attempt at a “speculative” treatment."|FALSE

In modern times especially thephenomena of _animal magnetism_ have given, even in experience, a livelyand visible confirmation of the underlying unity of soul, and of the powerof its “ideality.” Before these facts, the rigid distinctions of practicalcommon sense were struck with confusion; and the necessity of a“speculative” examination with a view to the removal of difficulties wasmore directly forced upon the student."|FALSE
39064|"§ 380. The “concrete” nature of mind involves for the observer thepeculiar difficulty that the several grades and special types whichdevelop its intelligible unity in detail are not left standing as so manyseparate existences confronting its more advanced aspects. It is otherwisein external nature. There, matter and movement, for example, have amanifestation all their own—it is the solar system; and similarly the_differentiae_ of sense-perception have a sort of earlier existence in theproperties of _bodies_, and still more independently in the four elements.The species and grades of mental evolution, on the contrary, lose theirseparate existence and become factors, states and features in the highergrades of development. As a consequence of this, a lower and more abstractaspect of mind betrays the presence in it, even to experience, of a highergrade. Under the guise of sensation, e.g., we may find the very highestmental life as its modification or its embodiment. And so sensation, whichis but a mere form and vehicle, may to the superficial glance seem to bethe proper seat and, as it were, the source of those moral and religiousprinciples with which it is charged; and the moral and religiousprinciples thus modified may seem to call for treatment as species ofsensation. But at the same time, when lower grades of mental life areunder examination, it becomes necessary, if we desire to point to actualcases of them in experience, to direct attention to more advanced gradesfor which they are mere forms.

Asomewhat different answer has been given by all philosophers since thisrelation came to be expressly discussed. Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza,and Leibnitz have all indicated God as this _nexus_. They meant that thefinitude of soul and matter were only ideal and unreal distinctions; and,so holding, these philosophers took God, not, as so often is done, merelyas another word for the incomprehensible, but rather as the sole trueidentity of finite mind and matter. But either this identity, as in thecase of Spinoza, is too abstract, or, as in the case of Leibnitz, thoughhis Monad of monads brings things into being, it does so only by an act ofjudgment or choice.

The characterisation given in the section is abstract; itprimarily treats waking merely as a natural fact, containing the mentalelement _implicite_ but not yet as invested with a special being of itsown. If we are to speak more concretely of this distinction (infundamentals it remains the same), we must take the self-existence of theindividual soul in its higher aspects as the Ego of consciousness and asintelligent mind. The difficulty raised anent the distinction of the twostates properly arises, only when we also take into account the dreams insleep and describe these dreams, as well as the mental representations inthe sober waking consciousness, under one and the same title of mentalrepresentations. Thus superficially classified as states of mentalrepresentation the two coincide, because we have lost sight of thedifference; and in the case of any assignable distinction of wakingconsciousness, we can always return to the trivial remark that all this isnothing more than mental idea. But the concrete theory of the waking soulin its realised being views it as _consciousness_ and _intellect_: and theworld of intelligent consciousness is something quite different from apicture of mere ideas and images. The latter are in the main onlyexternally conjoined, in an unintelligent way, by the laws of theso-called _Association of Ideas_; though here and there of course logicalprinciples may also be operative. But in the waking state man behavesessentially as a concrete ego, an intelligence: and because of thisintelligence his sense-perception stands before him as a concrete totalityof features in which each member, each point, takes up its place as at thesame time determined through and with all the rest. Thus the factsembodied in his sensation are authenticated, not by his mere subjectiverepresentation and distinction of the facts as something external from theperson, but by virtue of the concrete interconnexion in which each partstands with all parts of this complex. The waking state is the concreteconsciousness of this mutual corroboration of each single factor of itscontent by all the others in the picture as perceived. The consciousnessof this interdependence need not be explicit and distinct. Still thisgeneral setting to all sensations is implicitly present in the concretefeeling of self.—In order to see the difference of dreaming and waking weneed only keep in view the Kantian distinction between subjectivity andobjectivity of mental representation (the latter depending upondetermination through categories): remembering, as already noted, thatwhat is actually present in mind need not be therefore explicitly realisedin consciousness, just as little as the exaltation of the intellectualsense to God need stand before consciousness in the shape of proofs ofGod’s existence, although, as before explained, these proofs only serve toexpress the net worth and content of that feeling."|FALSE

As sentient, the soul is no longer a mere natural, but an inward,individuality: the individuality which in the merely substantial totalitywas only formal to it has to be liberated and made independent."|FALSE
39064|"Nowhere so much as in the case of the soul (and still more of the mind) ifwe are to understand it, must that feature of “ideality” be kept in view,which represents it as the _negation_ of the real, but a negation, wherethe real is put past, virtually retained, although it does not _exist_.The feature is one with which we are familiar in regard to our mentalideas or to memory. Every individual is an infinite treasury ofsensations, ideas, acquired lore, thoughts, &c.; and yet the ego is oneand uncompounded, a deep featureless characterless mine, in which all thisis stored up, without existing. It is only when _I_ call to mind _an_idea, that I bring it out of that interior to existence beforeconsciousness. Sometimes, in sickness, ideas and information, supposed tohave been forgotten years ago, because for so long they had not beenbrought into consciousness, once more come to light. They were not in ourpossession, nor by such reproduction as occurs in sickness do they for thefuture come into our possession; and yet they were in us and continue tobe in us still. Thus a person can never know how much of things he oncelearned he really has in him, should he have once forgotten them: theybelong not to his actuality or subjectivity as such, but only to hisimplicit self. And under all the superstructure of specialised andinstrumental consciousness that may subsequently be added to it, theindividuality always remains this single-souled inner life. At the presentstage this singleness is, primarily, to be defined as one of feeling—asembracing the corporeal in itself: thus denying the view that this body issomething material, with parts outside parts and outside the soul. Just asthe number and variety of mental representations is no argument for anextended and real multeity in the ego; so the “real” outness of parts inthe body has no truth for the sentient soul. As sentient, the soul ischaracterised as immediate, and so as natural and corporeal: but theoutness of parts and sensible multiplicity of this corporeal counts forthe soul (as it counts for the intelligible unity) not as anything real,and therefore not as a barrier: the soul is this intelligible unity _inexistence_,—the existent speculative principle. Thus in the body it is onesimple, omnipresent unity. As to the representative faculty the body isbut _one_ representation, and the infinite variety of its materialstructure and organisation is reduced to the _simplicity_ of one definiteconception: so in the sentient soul, the corporeity, and all that outnessof parts to parts which belongs to it, is reduced to _ideality_ (the_truth_ of the natural multiplicity).

In hissubjective ideas and plans he has also before him this causally connectedscheme of things he calls his world and the series of means which bringhis ideas and his purposes into adjustment with the objective existences,which are also means and ends to each other.

And because it is the adult,formed, and developed consciousness which is degraded into this state ofsensitivity, it retains along with its content a certain nominalself-hood, a formal vision and awareness, which however does not go so faras the conscious judgment or discernment by which its contents, when it ishealthy and awake, exist for it as an outward objectivity. The individualis thus a monad which is inwardly aware of its actuality—a genius whichbeholds itself. The characteristic point in such knowledge is that thevery same facts (which for the healthy consciousness are an objectivepractical reality, and to know which, in its sober moods, it needs theintelligent chain of means and conditions in all their real expansion) arenow immediately known and perceived in this immanence. This perception isa sort of _clairvoyance_; for it is a consciousness living in theundivided substantiality of the genius, and finding itself in the veryheart of the interconnexion, and so can dispense with the series ofconditions, external one to another, which lead up to theresult,—conditions which cool reflection has in succession to traverse andin so doing feels the limits of its own individual externality. But suchclairvoyance—just because its dim and turbid vision does not present thefacts in a rational interconnexion—is for that very reason at the mercy ofevery private contingency of feeling and fancy, &c.—not to mention thatforeign _suggestions_ (see later) intrude into its vision.

39064|"(δ) An essential feature of this sensitivity, with its absence ofintelligent and volitional personality, is this, that it is a state ofpassivity, like that of the child in the womb. The patient in thiscondition is accordingly made, and continues to be, subject to the powerof another person, the magnetiser; so that when the two are thus inpsychical _rapport_, the selfless individual, not really a “person,” hasfor his subjective consciousness the consciousness of the other. Thislatter self-possessed individual is thus the effective subjective soul ofthe former, and the genius which may even supply him with a train ofideas. That the somnambulist perceives in himself tastes and smells whichare present in the person with whom he stands _en rapport_, and that he isaware of the other inner ideas and present perceptions of the latter as ifthey were his own, shows the substantial identity which the soul (whicheven in its concreteness is also truly immaterial) is capable of holdingwith another. When the substance of both is thus made one, there is onlyone subjectivity of consciousness: the patient has a sort ofindividuality, but it is empty, not on the spot, not actual: and thisnominal self accordingly derives its whole stock of ideas from thesensations and ideas of the other, in whom it sees, smells, tastes, reads,and hears. It is further to be noted on this point that the somnambulistis thus brought into _rapport_ with two genii and a twofold set of ideas,his own and that of the magnetiser. But it is impossible to say preciselywhich sensations and which visions he, in this nominal perception,receives, beholds and brings to knowledge from his own inward self, andwhich from the suggestions of the person with whom he stands in relation.This uncertainty may be the source of many deceptions, and accounts amongother things for the diversity that inevitably shows itself amongsomnambulists from different countries and under _rapport_ with persons ofdifferent education, as regards their views on morbid states and themethods of cure, or medicines for them, as well as on scientific andintellectual topics."|FALSE

The purely sensitive life, onthe contrary, even when it retains that mere nominal consciousness, as inthe morbid state alluded to, is just this form of immediacy, without anydistinctions between subjective and objective, between intelligentpersonality and objective world, and without the aforementioned finiteties between them. Hence to understand this intimate conjunction, which,though all-embracing, is without any definite points of attachment, isimpossible, so long as we assume independent personalities, independentone of another and of the objective world which is their content—so longas we assume the absolute spatial and material externality of one part ofbeing to another."|FALSE

The fully-furnished self ofintelligent consciousness is a conscious subject, which is consistent initself according to an order and behaviour which follows from itsindividual position and its connexion with the external world, which is noless a world of law. But when it is engrossed with a single phase offeeling, it fails to assign that phase its proper place and duesubordination in the individual system of the world which a conscioussubject is.

Mind as such is free, and thereforenot susceptible of this malady. But in older metaphysics mind was treatedas a soul, as a thing; and it is only as a thing, i.e. as somethingnatural and existent, that it is liable to insanity—the settled fixture ofsome finite element in it.

Error and that sort of thingis a proposition consistently admitted to a place in the objectiveinterconnexion of things. In the concrete, however, it is often difficultto say where it begins to become derangement. A violent, but groundlessand senseless outburst of hatred, &c., may, in contrast to a presupposedhigher self-possession and stability of character, make its victim seem tobe beside himself with frenzy. But the main point in derangement is thecontradiction which a feeling with a fixed corporeal embodiment sets upagainst the whole mass of adjustments forming the concrete consciousness.The mind which is in a condition of mere _being_, and where such being isnot rendered fluid in its consciousness, is diseased. The contents whichare set free in this reversion to mere nature are the self-seekingaffections of the heart, such as vanity, pride, and the rest of thepassions—fancies and hopes—merely personal love and hatred. When theinfluence of self-possession and of general principles, moral andtheoretical, is relaxed, and ceases to keep the natural temper under lockand key, the earthly elements are set free—that evil which is alwayslatent in the heart, because the heart as immediate is natural andselfish. It is the evil genius of man which gains the upper hand ininsanity, but in distinction from and contrast to the better and moreintelligent part, which is there also. Hence this state is mentalderangement and distress. The right psychical treatment therefore keeps inview the truth that insanity is not an abstract _loss_ of reason (neitherin the point of intelligence nor of will and its responsibility), but onlyderangement, only a contradiction in a still subsisting reason;—just asphysical disease is not an abstract, i.e. mere and total, loss of health(if it were that, it would be death), but a contradiction in it. Thishumane treatment, no less benevolent than reasonable (the services ofPinel towards which deserve the highest acknowledgment), presupposes thepatient’s rationality, and in that assumption has the sound basis fordealing with him on this side—just as in the case of bodily disease thephysician bases his treatment on the vitality which as such still containshealth."|FALSE

Habit is rightly called asecond nature; nature, because it is an immediate being of the soul; asecond nature, because it is an immediacy created by the soul, impressingand moulding the corporeality which enters into the modes of feeling assuch and into the representations and volitions so far as they have takencorporeal form (§ 401)."|FALSE

The want of freedom in habit ispartly merely formal, as habit merely attaches to the being of the soul;partly only relative, so far as it strictly speaking arises only in thecase of bad habits, or so far as a habit is opposed by another purpose:whereas the habit of right and goodness is an embodiment of liberty. Themain point about Habit is that by its means man gets emancipated from thefeelings, even in being affected by them. The different forms of this maybe described as follows: (α) The _immediate_ feeling is negated andtreated as indifferent. One who gets inured against external sensations(frost, heat, weariness of the limbs, &c., sweet tastes, &c.), and whohardens the heart against misfortune, acquires a strength which consistsin this, that although the frost, &c.—or the misfortune—is felt, theaffection is deposed to a mere externality and immediacy; the universalpsychical life keeps its own abstract independence in it, and theself-feeling as such, consciousness, reflection, and any other purposesand activity, are no longer bothered with it. (β) There is indifferencetowards the satisfaction: the desires and impulses are by the _habit_ oftheir satisfaction deadened. This is the rational liberation from them;whereas monastic renunciation and forcible interference do not free fromthem, nor are they in conception rational. Of course in all this it isassumed that the impulses are kept as the finite modes they naturally are,and that they, like their satisfaction, are subordinated as partialfactors to the reasonable will.

Specific feelings canonly get bodily shape in a perfectly specific way (§ 401); and theimmediate portion of body is a particular possibility for a specific aim(a particular aspect of its differentiated structure, a particular organof its organic system). To mould such an aim in the organic body is tobring out and express the “ideality” which is implicit in matter always,and especially so in the specific bodily part, and thus to enable thesoul, under its volitional and conceptual characters, to exist assubstance in its corporeity.

Similarly our eyesight is the concrete habit which, withoutan express adjustment, combines in a single act the several modificationsof sensation, consciousness, intuition, intelligence, &c., which make itup. Thinking, too, however free and active in its own pure element itbecomes, no less requires habit and familiarity (this impromptuity or formof immediacy), by which it is the property of my single self where I canfreely and in all directions range. It is through this habit that I cometo realise my _existence_ as a thinking being.

With regard to the elementary _material_ of language, whileon one hand the theory of mere accident has disappeared, on the other theprinciple of imitation has been restricted to the slight range it actuallycovers—that of vocal objects. Yet one may still hear the German languagepraised for its wealth—that wealth consisting in its special expressionfor special sounds—_Rauschen_, _Sausen_, _Knarren_, &c.;—there have beencollected more than a hundred such words, perhaps: the humour of themoment creates fresh ones when it pleases. Such superabundance in therealm of sense and of triviality contributes nothing to form the realwealth of a cultivated language. The strictly raw material of languageitself depends more upon an inward symbolism than a symbolism referring toexternal objects; it depends, i.e. on anthropological articulation, as itwere the posture in the corporeal act of oral utterance. For each voweland consonant accordingly, as well as for their more abstract elements(the posture of lips, palate, tongue in each) and for their combinations,people have tried to find the appropriate signification.

Having been originally sensuous intuitions, theyare reduced to signs, and thus have only traces left of their originalmeaning, if it be not altogether extinguished. As to the _formal_ element,again, it is the work of analytic intellect which informs language withits categories: it is this logical instinct which gives rise to grammar.The study of languages still in their original state, which we have firstreally begun to make acquaintance with in modern times, has shown on thispoint that they contain a very elaborate grammar and express distinctionswhich are lost or have been largely obliterated in the languages of morecivilised nations. It seems as if the language of the most civilisednations has the most imperfect grammar, and that the same language has amore perfect grammar when the nation is in a more uncivilised state thanwhen it reaches a higher civilisation.

39064|"In speaking of vocal (which is the original) language, we may touch, onlyin passing, upon written language,—a further development in the particularsphere of language which borrows the help of an externally practicalactivity. It is from the province of immediate spatial intuition to whichwritten language proceeds that it takes and produces the signs (§ 454). Inparticular, hieroglyphics uses spatial figures to designate _ideas_;alphabetical writing, on the other hand, uses them to designate vocalnotes which are already signs. Alphabetical writing thus consists of signsof signs,—the words or concrete signs of vocal language being analysedinto their simple elements, which severally receivedesignation.—Leibnitz’s practical mind misled him to exaggerate theadvantages which a complete written language, formed on the hieroglyphicmethod (and hieroglyphics are used even where there is alphabetic writing,as in our signs for the numbers, the planets, the chemical elements, &c.),would have as a universal language for the intercourse of nations andespecially of scholars. But we may be sure that it was rather theintercourse of nations (as was probably the case in Phoenicia, and stilltakes place in Canton—see _Macartney’s Travels_ by Staunton) whichoccasioned the need of alphabetical writing and led to its formation. Atany rate a comprehensive hieroglyphic language for ever completed isimpracticable. Sensible objects no doubt admit of permanent signs; but, asregards signs for mental objects, the progress of thought and thecontinual development of logic lead to changes in the views of theirinternal relations and thus also of their nature; and this would involvethe rise of a new hieroglyphical denotation. Even in the case ofsense-objects it happens that their names, i.e. their signs in vocallanguage, are frequently changed, as e.g. in chemistry and mineralogy. Nowthat it has been forgotten what names properly are, viz. externalitieswhich of themselves have no sense, and only get signification as signs,and now that, instead of names proper, people ask for terms expressing asort of definition, which is frequently changed capriciously andfortuitously, the denomination, i.e. the composite name formed of signs oftheir generic characters or other supposed characteristic properties, isaltered in accordance with the differences of view with regard to thegenus or other supposed specific property. It is only a stationarycivilisation, like the Chinese, which admits of the hieroglyphic languageof that nation; and its method of writing moreover can only be the lot ofthat small part of a nation which is in exclusive possession of mentalculture.—The progress of the vocal language depends most closely on thehabit of alphabetical writing; by means of which only does vocal languageacquire the precision and purity of its articulation. The imperfection ofthe Chinese vocal language is notorious: numbers of its words possessseveral utterly different meanings, as many as ten and twenty, so that, inspeaking, the distinction is made perceptible merely by accent andintensity, by speaking low and soft or crying out. The European, learningto speak Chinese, falls into the most ridiculous blunders before he hasmastered these absurd refinements of accentuation. Perfection hereconsists in the opposite of that _parler sans accent_ which in Europe isjustly required of an educated speaker. The hieroglyphic mode of writingkeeps the Chinese vocal language from reaching that objective precisionwhich is gained in articulation by alphabetic writing."|FALSE
39064|"Alphabetic writing is on all accounts the more intelligent: in it the_word_—the mode, peculiar to the intellect, of uttering its ideas mostworthily—is brought to consciousness and made an object of reflection.Engaging the attention of intelligence, as it does, it is analysed; thework of sign-making is reduced to its few simple elements (the primarypostures of articulation) in which the sense-factor in speech is broughtto the form of universality, at the same time that in this elementaryphase it acquires complete precision and purity. Thus alphabetic writingretains at the same time the advantage of vocal language, that the ideashave names strictly so called: the name is the simple sign for the exactidea, i.e. the simple plain idea, not decomposed into its features andcompounded out of them. Hieroglyphics, instead of springing from thedirect analysis of sensible signs, like alphabetic writing, arise from anantecedent analysis of ideas. Thus a theory readily arises that all ideasmay be reduced to their elements, or simple logical terms, so that fromthe elementary signs chosen to express these (as, in the case of theChinese _Koua_, the simple straight stroke, and the stroke broken into twoparts) a hieroglyphic system would be generated by their composition. Thisfeature of hieroglyphic—the analytical designations of ideas—which misledLeibnitz to regard it as preferable to alphabetic writing is rather inantagonism with the fundamental desideratum of language,—the name. To wanta name means that for the immediate idea (which, however ample aconnotation it may include, is still for the mind simple in the name), werequire a simple immediate sign which for its own sake does not suggestanything, and has for its sole function to signify and represent sensiblythe simple idea as such. It is not merely the image-loving andimage-limited intelligence that lingers over the simplicity of ideas andredintegrates them from the more abstract factors into which they havebeen analysed: thought too reduces to the form of a simple thought theconcrete connotation which it “resumes” and reunites from the mereaggregate of attributes to which analysis has reduced it. Both alikerequire such signs, simple in respect of their meaning: signs, whichthough consisting of several letters or syllables and even decomposed intosuch, yet do not exhibit a combination of several ideas.—What has beenstated is the principle for settling the value of these written languages.It also follows that in hieroglyphics the relations of concrete mentalideas to one another must necessarily be tangled and perplexed, and thatthe analysis of these (and the proximate results of such analysis mustagain be analysed) appears to be possible in the most various anddivergent ways. Every divergence in analysis would give rise to anotherformation of the written name; just as in modern times (as already noted,even in the region of sense) muriatic acid has undergone several changesof name.

Acquired habit subsequently effaces the peculiarity by whichalphabetic writing appears, in the interest of vision, as a roundabout wayto ideas by means of audibility; it makes them a sort of hieroglyphic tous, so that in using them we need not consciously realise them by means oftones, whereas people unpractised in reading utter aloud what they read inorder to catch its meaning in the sound. Thus, while (with the facultywhich transformed alphabetic writing into hieroglyphics) the capacity ofabstraction gained by the first practice remains, hieroglyphic reading isof itself a deaf reading and a dumb writing. It is true that the audible(which is in time) and the visible (which is in space), each have theirown basis, one no less authoritative than the other. But in the case ofalphabetic writing there is only a _single_ basis: the two aspects occupytheir rightful relation to each other: the visible language is related tothe vocal only as a sign, and intelligence expresses itself immediatelyand unconditionally by speaking.—The instrumental function of thecomparatively non-sensuous element of tone for all ideational work showsitself further as peculiarly important in memory which forms the passagefrom representation to thought."|FALSE

In this phase, as it is at bottom a subjectivity simply identicalwith reason, it has no doubt a rational content, but a content which as itstands is individual, and for that reason also natural, contingent andsubjective,—a content which may be determined quite as much by merepersonalities of want and opinion, &c., and by the subjectivity whichselfishly sets itself against the universal, as it may be virtually inconformity with reason."|FALSE

So far as thisappeal implies (1) that these ideas are immanent in his own self, and (2)that when feeling is opposed to the logical understanding, it, and not thepartial abstractions of the latter, _may_ be the _totality_—the appeal hasa legitimate meaning. But on the other hand feeling too _may_ be onesided,unessential and bad.

If feelings are of theright sort, it is because of their quality or content,—which is right onlyso far as it is intrinsically universal or has its source in the thinkingmind. The difficulty for the logical intellect consists in throwing offthe separation it has arbitrarily imposed between the several faculties offeeling and thinking mind, and coming to see that in the human being thereis only _one_ reason, in feeling, volition, and thought. Anotherdifficulty connected with this is found in the fact that the Ideas whichare the special property of the thinking mind, viz. God, law and morality,can also be _felt_.

So long as we study practical feelings and dispositionsspecially, we have only to deal with the selfish, bad, and evil; it isthese alone which belong to the individuality which retains its oppositionto the universal: their content is the reverse of rights and duties, andprecisely in that way do they—but only in antithesis to the latter—retaina speciality of their own."|FALSE

It is this objectificationwhich evinces their real value, their mutual connexions, and their truth.And thus it was a true perception when Plato (especially including as hedid the mind’s whole nature under its right) showed that the full realityof justice could be exhibited only in the _objective_ phase of justice,viz. in the construction of the State as the ethical life."|FALSE

It provides for the reasonable will,—in sofar as it is in the individuals only _implicitly_ the universalwill,—coming to a consciousness and an understanding of itself and being_found_; also for that will being put in actuality, through the action ofthe government and its several branches, and not left to perish, butprotected both against _their_ casual subjectivity and against that of theindividuals.

With the state there arises inequality, thedifference of governing powers and of governed, magistracies, authorities,directories, &c. The principle of equality, logically carried out, rejectsall differences, and thus allows no sort of political condition to exist.Liberty and equality are indeed the foundation of the state, but as themost abstract also the most superficial, and for that very reasonnaturally the most familiar.

But the notion ofliberty, as it exists as such, without further specification anddevelopment, is abstract subjectivity, as a person capable of property (§488). This single abstract feature of personality constitutes the actual_equality_ of human beings. But that this freedom should exist, that itshould be _man_ (and not as in Greece, Rome, &c. _some_ men) that isrecognised and legally regarded as a person, is so little _by nature_,that it is rather only a result and product of the consciousness of thedeepest principle of mind, and of the universality and expansion of thisconsciousness. That the citizens are equal before the law contains a greattruth, but which so expressed is a tautology: it only states that thelegal status in general exists, that the laws rule. But, as regards theconcrete, the citizens—besides their personality—are equal before the lawonly in these points when they are otherwise equal _outside the law_. Onlythat equality which (in whatever way it be) they, as it happens, otherwisehave in property, age, physical strength, talent, skill, &c.—or even incrime, can and ought to make them deserve equal treatment before thelaw:—only it can make them—as regards taxation, military service,eligibility to office, &c.—punishment, &c.—equal in the concrete.

Formerly the legally definedrights, private as well as public rights of a nation, town, &c. werecalled its “liberties.” Really, every genuine law is a liberty: itcontains a reasonable principle of objective mind; in other words, itembodies a liberty. Nothing has become, on the contrary, more familiarthan the idea that each must _restrict_ his liberty in relation to theliberty of others: that the state is a condition of such reciprocalrestriction, and that the laws are restrictions. To such habits of mindliberty is viewed as only casual good-pleasure and self-will. Hence it hasalso been said that “modern” nations are only susceptible of equality, orof equality more than liberty: and that for no other reason than that,with an assumed definition of liberty (chiefly the participation of all inpolitical affairs and actions), it was impossible to make ends meet inactuality—which is at once more reasonable and more powerful than abstractpresuppositions. On the contrary, it should be said that it is just thegreat development and maturity of form in modern states which produces thesupreme concrete inequality of individuals in actuality: while, throughthe deeper reasonableness of laws and the greater stability of the legalstate, it gives rise to greater and more stable liberty, which it canwithout incompatibility allow. Even the superficial distinction of thewords liberty and equality points to the fact that the former tends toinequality: whereas, on the contrary, the current notions of liberty onlycarry us back to equality. But the more we fortify liberty,—as security ofproperty, as possibility for each to develop and make the best of histalents and good qualities, the more it gets taken for granted: and thenthe sense and appreciation of liberty especially turns in a _subjective_direction. By this is meant the liberty to attempt action on every side,and to throw oneself at pleasure in action for particular and for generalintellectual interests, the removal of all checks on the individualparticularity, as well as the inward liberty in which the subject hasprinciples, has an insight and conviction of his own, and thus gains moralindependence. But this liberty itself on one hand implies that supremedifferentiation in which men are unequal and make themselves more unequalby education; and on another it only grows up under conditions of thatobjective liberty, and is and could grow to such height only in modernstates. If, with this development of particularity, there be simultaneousand endless increase of the number of wants, and of the difficulty ofsatisfying them, of the lust of argument and the fancy of detectingfaults, with its insatiate vanity, it is all but part of thatindiscriminating relaxation of individuality in this sphere whichgenerates all possible complications, and must deal with them as it can.Such a sphere is of course also the field of restrictions, because libertyis there under the taint of natural self-will and self-pleasing, and hastherefore to restrict itself: and that, not merely with regard to thenaturalness, self-will and self-conceit, of others, but especially andessentially with regard to reasonable liberty."|FALSE

The _division_ ofthese powers has been treated as _the_ condition of political equilibrium,meaning by division their _independence_ one of another inexistence,—subject always however to the above-mentioned subsumption ofthe powers of the individual under the power of the general. The theory ofsuch “division” unmistakably implies the elements of the notion, but socombined by “understanding” as to result in an absurd collocation, insteadof the self-redintegration of the living spirit. The one essential canonto make liberty deep and real is to give every business belonging to thegeneral interests of the state a separate organisation wherever they areessentially distinct. Such real division must be: for liberty is only deepwhen it is differentiated in all its fullness and these differencesmanifested in existence.

In the perfect form ofthe state, in which each and every element of the notion has reached freeexistence, this subjectivity is not a so-called “moral person,” or adecree issuing from a majority (forms in which the unity of the decreeingwill has not an _actual_ existence), but an actual individual,—the will ofa decreeing individual,—_monarchy_.

39064|"The question which is most discussed is in what sense we are to understandthe participation of private persons in state affairs. For it is asprivate persons that the members of bodies of estates are primarily to betaken, be they treated as mere individuals, or as representatives of anumber of people or of the nation. The aggregate of private persons isoften spoken of as the _nation_: but as such an aggregate it is _vulgus_,not _populus_: and in this direction, it is the one sole aim of the statethat a nation should _not_ come to existence, to power and action, _assuch an aggregate_. Such a condition of a nation is a condition oflawlessness, demoralisation, brutishness: in it the nation would only be ashapeless, wild, blind force, like that of the stormy, elemental sea,which however is not self-destructive, as the nation—a spiritualelement—would be. Yet such a condition may be often heard described asthat of true freedom. If there is to be any sense in embarking upon thequestion of the participation of private persons in public affairs, it isnot a brutish mass, but an already organised nation—one in which agovernmental power exists—which should be presupposed. The desirability ofsuch participation however is not to be put in the superiority ofparticular intelligence, which private persons are supposed to have overstate officials—the contrary may be the case—nor in the superiority oftheir good will for the general best. The members of civil society as suchare rather people who find their nearest duty in their private interestand (as especially in the feudal society) in the interest of theirprivileged corporation. Take the case of _England_ which, because privatepersons have a predominant share in public affairs, has been regarded ashaving the freest of all constitutions. Experience shows that thatcountry—as compared with the other civilised states of Europe—is the mostbackward in civil and criminal legislation, in the law and liberty ofproperty, in arrangements for art and science, and that objective freedomor rational right is rather _sacrificed_ to formal right and particularprivate interest; and that this happens even in the institutions andpossessions supposed to be dedicated to religion. The desirability ofprivate persons taking part in public affairs is partly to be put in theirconcrete, and therefore more urgent, sense of general wants. But the truemotive is the right of the collective spirit to appear as an _externallyuniversal_ will, acting with orderly and express efficacy for the publicconcerns. By this satisfaction of this right it gets its own lifequickened, and at the same time breathes fresh life in the administrativeofficials; who thus have it brought home to them that not merely have theyto enforce duties but also to have regard to rights. Private citizens arein the state the incomparably greater number, and form the multitude ofsuch as are recognised as persons. Hence the will-reason exhibits itsexistence in them as a preponderating majority of freemen, or in its“reflectional” universality, which has its actuality vouchsafed it as aparticipation in the sovereignty. But it has already been noted as a“moment” of civil society (§§ 527, 534) that the individuals rise fromexternal into substantial universality, and form a _particular_ kind,—theEstates: and it is not in the inorganic form of mere individuals as such(after the _democratic_ fashion of election), but as organic factors, asestates, that they enter upon that participation. In the state a power oragency must never appear and act as a formless, inorganic shape, i.e.basing itself on the principle of multeity and mere numbers."|FALSE
39064|"Assemblies of Estates have been wrongly designated as the _legislativepower_, so far as they form only one branch of that power,—a branch inwhich the special government-officials have an _ex officio_ share, whilethe sovereign power has the privilege of final decision. In a civilisedstate moreover legislation can only be a further modification of existinglaw, and so-called new laws can only deal with minutiae of detail andparticularities (cf. § 529, note), the main drift of which has beenalready prepared or preliminarily settled by the practice of thelaw-courts. The so-called _financial law_, in so far as it requires theassent of the estates, is really a government affair: it is onlyimproperly called a law, in the general sense of embracing a wide, indeedthe whole, range of the external means of government. The finances dealwith what in their nature are only particular needs, ever newly recurring,even if they touch on the sum total of such needs. If the main part of therequirement were—as it very likely is—regarded as permanent, the provisionfor it would have more the nature of a law: but to be a law, it would haveto be made once for all, and not be made yearly, or every few years,afresh. The part which varies according to time and circumstances concernsin reality the smallest part of the amount, and the provisions with regardto it have even less the character of a law: and yet it is and may be onlythis slight variable part which is matter of dispute, and can be subjectedto a varying yearly estimate. It is this last then which falsely bears thehigh-sounding name of the “_Grant_” of the _Budget_, i.e. of the whole ofthe finances. A law for one year and made each year has even to the plainman something palpably absurd: for he distinguishes the essential anddeveloped universal, as content of a true law, from the reflectionaluniversality which only externally embraces what in its nature is many. Togive the name of a law to the annual fixing of financial requirements onlyserves—with the presupposed separation of legislative from executive—tokeep up the illusion of that separation having real existence, and toconceal the fact that the legislative power, when it makes a decree aboutfinance, is really engaged with strict executive business. But theimportance attached to the power of from time to time granting “supply,”on the ground that the assembly of estates possesses in it a _check_ onthe government, and thus a guarantee against injustice and violence,—thisimportance is in one way rather plausible than real. The financialmeasures necessary for the state’s subsistence cannot be made conditionalon any other circumstances, nor can the state’s subsistence be put yearlyin doubt. It would be a parallel absurdity if the government were e.g. togrant and arrange the judicial institutions always for a limited timemerely; and thus, by the threat of suspending the activity of such aninstitution and the fear of a consequent state of brigandage, reserve foritself a means of coercing private individuals. Then again, the picturesof a condition of affairs, in which it might be useful and necessary tohave in hand means of compulsion, are partly based on the false conceptionof a contract between rulers and ruled, and partly presuppose thepossibility of such a divergence in spirit between these two parties aswould make constitution and government quite out of the question. If wesuppose the empty possibility of getting _help_ by such compulsive meansbrought into existence, such help would rather be the derangement anddissolution of the state, in which there would no longer be a government,but only parties, and the violence and oppression of one party would onlybe helped away by the other.

Such _a priori_history-writing has sometimes burst out in quarters where one would leasthave expected it, especially on the philological side, and in Germany morethan in France and England, where the art of historical writing has gonethrough a process of purification to a firmer and maturer character.Fictions, like that of a primitive age and its primitive people, possessedfrom the first of the true knowledge of God and all the sciences,—ofsacerdotal races,—and, when we come to minutiae, of a Roman epic, supposedto be the source of the legends which pass current for the history ofancient Rome, &c., have taken the place of the pragmatising which detectedpsychological motives and associations. There is a wide circle of personswho seem to consider it incumbent on a _learned_ and _ingenious_ historiandrawing from the original sources to concoct such baseless fancies, andform bold combinations of them from a learned rubbish-heap ofout-of-the-way and trivial facts, in defiance of the best-accreditedhistory."|FALSE

39064|"The requirement of impartiality addressed to the history of philosophy(and also, we may add, to the history of religion, first in general, andsecondly, to church history) generally implies an even more decided baragainst presupposition of any objective aim. As the State was alreadycalled the point to which in political history criticism had to refer allevents, so here the “_Truth_” must be the object to which the severaldeeds and events of the spirit would have to be referred. What is actuallydone is rather to make the contrary presupposition. Histories with such anobject as religion or philosophy are understood to have only subjectiveaims for their theme, i.e. only opinions and mere ideas, not an essentialand realised object like the truth. And that with the mere excuse thatthere is no truth. On this assumption the sympathy with truth appears asonly a partiality of the usual sort, a partiality for opinion and mereideas, which all alike have no stuff in them, and are all treated asindifferent. In that way historical truth means but correctness—anaccurate report of externals, without critical treatment save as regardsthis correctness—admitting, in this case, only qualitative andquantitative judgments, no judgments of necessity or notion (cf. notes to§§ 172 and 175). But, really, if Rome or the German empire, &c. are anactual and genuine object of political history, and the aim to which thephenomena are to be related and by which they are to be judged; then inuniversal history the genuine spirit, the consciousness of it and of itsessence, is even in a higher degree a true and actual object and theme,and an aim to which all other phenomena are essentially and actuallysubservient. Only therefore through their relationship to it, i.e. throughthe judgment in which they are subsumed under it, while it inheres inthem, have they their value and even their existence. It is the spiritwhich not merely broods _over_ history as over the waters, but lives in itand is alone its principle of movement: and in the path of that spirit,liberty, i.e. a development determined by the notion of spirit, is theguiding principle and only its notion its final aim, i.e. truth.

The spirit, however, (which _thinks_ in this moral organism)overrides and absorbs within itself the finitude attaching to it asnational spirit in its state and the state’s temporal interests, in thesystem of laws and usages. It rises to apprehend itself in itsessentiality. Such apprehension, however, still has the immanentlimitedness of the national spirit. But the spirit which thinks inuniversal history, stripping off at the same time those limitations of theseveral national minds and its own temporal restrictions, lays hold of itsconcrete universality, and rises to apprehend the absolute mind, as theeternally actual truth in which the contemplative reason enjoys freedom,while the necessity of nature and the necessity of history are onlyministrant to its revelation and the vessels of its honour."|FALSE
39064|"The strictly technical aspects of the Mind’s elevation to God have beenspoken of in the Introduction to the Logic (cf. especially § 51, note). Asregards the starting-point of that elevation, Kant has on the wholeadopted the most correct, when he treats belief in God as proceeding fromthe practical Reason. For that starting-point contains the material orcontent which constitutes the content of the notion of God. But the trueconcrete material is neither Being (as in the cosmological) nor mereaction by design (as in the physico-theological proof) but the Mind, theabsolute characteristic and function of which is effective reason, i.e.the self-determining and self-realising notion itself,—Liberty. That theelevation of subjective mind to God which these considerations give is byKant again deposed to a _postulate_—a mere “ought”—is the peculiarperversity, formerly noticed, of calmly and simply reinstating as true andvalid that very antithesis of finitude, the supersession of which intotruth is the essence of that elevation."|FALSE

This factor, abstract in the formal treatment of logic, nowgets its most concrete interpretation. The finite, from which the start isnow made, is the real ethical self-consciousness. The negation throughwhich that consciousness raises its spirit to its truth, is thepurification, _actually_ accomplished in the ethical world, whereby itsconscience is purged of subjective opinion and its will freed from theselfishness of desire. Genuine religion and genuine religiosity only issuefrom the moral life: religion is that life rising to think, i.e. becomingaware of the free universality of its concrete essence. Only from themoral life and by the moral life is the Idea of God seen to be freespirit: outside the ethical spirit therefore it is vain to seek for truereligion and religiosity."|FALSE
39064|"But—as is the case with all speculative process—this development of onething out of another means that what appears as sequel and derivative israther the absolute _prius_ of what it appears to be mediated by, and whatis here in mind known as its truth."|FALSE
39064|"Here then is the place to go more deeply into the reciprocal relationsbetween the state and religion, and in doing so to elucidate theterminology which is familiar and current on the topic. It is evident andapparent from what has preceded that moral life is the state retractedinto its inner heart and substance, while the state is the organisationand actualisation of moral life; and that religion is the very substanceof the moral life itself and of the state. At this rate, the state restson the ethical sentiment, and that on the religious. If religion then isthe consciousness of “absolute”_ truth_, then whatever is to rank as rightand justice, as law and duty, i.e. as _true_ in the world of free will,can be so esteemed only as it is participant in that truth, as it issubsumed under it and is its sequel. But if the truly moral life is to bea sequel of religion, then perforce religion must have the _genuine_content; i.e. the idea of God it knows must be the true and real. Theethical life is the divine spirit as indwelling in self-consciousness, asit is actually present in a nation and its individual members. Thisself-consciousness retiring upon itself out of its empirical actuality andbringing its truth to consciousness, has in its _faith_ and in its_conscience_ only what it has consciously secured in its spiritualactuality. The two are inseparable: there cannot be two kinds ofconscience, one religious and another ethical, differing from the formerin body and value of truth. But in point of form, i.e. for thought andknowledge—(and religion and ethical life belong to intelligence and are athinking and knowing)—the body of religious truth, as the pureself-subsisting and therefore supreme truth, exercises a sanction over themoral life which lies in empirical actuality. Thus for self-consciousnessreligion is the “basis” of moral life and of the state. It has been themonstrous blunder of our times to try to look upon these inseparables asseparable from one another, and even as mutually indifferent. The viewtaken of the relationship of religion and the state has been that, whereasthe state had an independent existence of its own, springing from someforce and power, religion was a later addition, something desirableperhaps for strengthening the political bulwarks, but purely subjective inindividuals:—or it may be, religion is treated as something without effecton the moral life of the state, i.e. its reasonable law and constitutionwhich are based on a ground of their own."|FALSE
39064|"As the inseparability of the two sides has been indicated, it may be worthwhile to note the separation as it appears on the side of religion. It isprimarily a point of form: the attitude which self-consciousness takes tothe body of truth. So long as this body of truth is the very substance orindwelling spirit of self-consciousness in its actuality, thenself-consciousness in this content has the certainty of itself and isfree. But if this present self-consciousness is lacking, then there may becreated, in point of form, a condition of spiritual slavery, even thoughthe _implicit_ content of religion is absolute spirit. This greatdifference (to cite a specific case) comes out within the Christianreligion itself, even though here it is not the nature-element in whichthe idea of God is embodied, and though nothing of the sort even enters asa factor into its central dogma and sole theme of a God who is known inspirit and in truth. And yet in Catholicism this spirit of all truth is inactuality set in rigid opposition to the self-conscious spirit. And, firstof all, God is in the “host” presented to religious adoration as an_external thing_. (In the Lutheran Church, on the contrary, the host assuch is not at first consecrated, but in the moment of enjoyment, i.e. inthe annihilation of its externality, and in the act of faith, i.e. in thefree self-certain spirit: only then is it consecrated and exalted to bepresent God.) From that first and supreme status of externalisation flowsevery other phase of externality,—of bondage, non-spirituality, andsuperstition. It leads to a laity, receiving its knowledge of divinetruth, as well as the direction of its will and conscience from withoutand from another order—which order again does not get possession of thatknowledge in a spiritual way only, but to that end essentially requires anexternal consecration. It leads to the non-spiritual style ofpraying—partly as mere moving of the lips, partly in the way that thesubject foregoes his right of directly addressing God, and prays others topray—addressing his devotion to miracle-working images, even to bones, andexpecting miracles from them. It leads, generally, to justification byexternal works, a merit which is supposed to be gained by acts, and evento be capable of being transferred to others. All this binds the spiritunder an externalism by which the very meaning of spirit is perverted andmisconceived at its source, and law and justice, morality and conscience,responsibility and duty are corrupted at their root."|FALSE
39064|"Along with this principle of spiritual bondage, and these applications ofit in the religious life, there can only go in the legislative andconstitutional system a legal and moral bondage, and a state oflawlessness and immorality in political life. Catholicism has been loudlypraised and is still often praised—logically enough—as the one religionwhich secures the stability of governments. But in reality this appliesonly to governments which are bound up with institutions founded on thebondage of the spirit (of that spirit which should have legal and moralliberty), i.e. with institutions that embody injustice and with a morallycorrupt and barbaric state of society. But these governments are not awarethat in fanaticism they have a terrible power, which does not rise inhostility against them, only so long as and only on condition that theyremain sunk in the thraldom of injustice and immorality. But in mind thereis a very different power available against that externalism anddismemberment induced by a false religion. Mind collects itself into itsinward free actuality. Philosophy awakes in the spirit of governments andnations the wisdom to discern what is essentially and actually right andreasonable in the real world. It was well to call these products ofthought, and in a special sense Philosophy, the wisdom of the world(170);for thought makes the spirit’s truth an actual present, leads it into thereal world, and thus liberates it in its actuality and in its own self."|FALSE
39064|"Thus set free, the content of religion assumes quite another shape. Solong as the form, i.e. our consciousness and subjectivity, lacked liberty,it followed necessarily that self-consciousness was conceived as notimmanent in the ethical principles which religion embodies, and theseprinciples were set at such a distance as to seem to have true being onlyas negative to actual self-consciousness. In this unreality ethicalcontent gets the name of _Holiness_. But once the divine spirit introducesitself into actuality, and actuality emancipates itself to spirit, thenwhat in the world was a postulate of holiness is supplanted by theactuality of _moral_ life. Instead of the vow of chastity, _marriage_ nowranks as the ethical relation; and, therefore, as the highest on this sideof humanity stands the family. Instead of the vow of poverty (muddled upinto a contradiction of assigning merit to whosoever gives away goods tothe poor, i.e. whosoever enriches them) is the precept of action toacquire goods through one’s own intelligence and industry,—of honesty incommercial dealing, and in the use of property,—in short moral life in thesocio-economic sphere. And instead of the vow of obedience, true religionsanctions obedience to the law and the legal arrangements of the state—anobedience which is itself the true freedom, because the state is aself-possessed, self-realising reason—in short, moral life in the state.Thus, and thus only, can law and morality exist. The precept of religion,“Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s” is not enough:the question is to settle what is Caesar’s, what belongs to the secularauthority: and it is sufficiently notorious that the secular no less thanthe ecclesiastical authority have claimed almost everything as their own.The divine spirit must interpenetrate the entire secular life: wherebywisdom is concrete within it, and it carries the terms of its ownjustification. But that concrete indwelling is only the aforesaid ethicalorganisations. It is the morality of marriage as against the sanctity of acelibate order;—the morality of economic and industrial action against thesanctity of poverty and its indolence;—the morality of an obediencededicated to the law of the state as against the sanctity of an obediencefrom which law and duty are absent and where conscience is enslaved. Withthe growing need for law and morality and the sense of the spirit’sessential liberty, there sets in a conflict of spirit with the religion ofunfreedom. It is no use to organise political laws and arrangements onprinciples of equity and reason, so long as in religion the principle ofunfreedom is not abandoned. A free state and a slavish religion areincompatible. It is silly to suppose that we may try to allot themseparate spheres, under the impression that their diverse natures willmaintain an attitude of tranquillity one to another and not break out incontradiction and battle. Principles of civil freedom can be but abstractand superficial, and political institutions deduced from them must be, iftaken alone, untenable, so long as those principles in their wisdommistake religion so much as not to know that the maxims of the reason inactuality have their last and supreme sanction in the religious consciencein subsumption under the consciousness of “absolute” truth. Let us supposeeven that, no matter how, a code of law should arise, so to speak _apriori_, founded on principles of reason, but in contradiction with anestablished religion based on principles of spiritual unfreedom; still, asthe duty of carrying out the laws lies in the hands of individual membersof the government, and of the various classes of the administrative_personnel_, it is vain to delude ourselves with the abstract and emptyassumption that the individuals will act only according to the letter ormeaning of the law, and not in the spirit of their religion where theirinmost conscience and supreme obligation lies. Opposed to what religionpronounces holy, the laws appear something made by human hands: eventhough backed by penalties and externally introduced, they could offer nolasting resistance to the contradiction and attacks of the religiousspirit. Such laws, however sound their provisions may be, thus founder onthe conscience, whose spirit is different from the spirit of the laws andrefuses to sanction them. It is nothing but a modern folly to try to altera corrupt moral organisation by altering its political constitution andcode of laws without changing the religion,—to make a revolution withouthaving made a reformation, to suppose that a political constitutionopposed to the old religion could live in peace and harmony with it andits sanctities, and that stability could be procured for the laws byexternal guarantees, e.g. so-called “chambers,” and the power given themto fix the budget, &c. (cf. § 544 note). At best it is only a temporaryexpedient—when it is obviously too great a task to descend into the depthsof the religious spirit and to raise that same spirit to its truth—to seekto separate law and justice from religion. Those guarantees are but rottenbulwarks against the consciences of the persons charged with administeringthe laws—among which laws these guarantees are included. It is indeed theheight and profanity of contradiction to seek to bind and subject to thesecular code the religious conscience to which mere human law is a thingprofane."|FALSE
39064|"The perception had dawned upon Plato with great clearness of the gulfwhich in his day had commenced to divide the established religion and thepolitical constitution, on one hand, from those deeper requirements which,on the other hand, were made upon religion and politics by liberty whichhad learnt to recognise its inner life. Plato gets hold of the thoughtthat a genuine constitution and a sound political life have their deeperfoundation on the Idea,—on the essentially and actually universal andgenuine principles of eternal righteousness. Now to see and ascertain whatthese are is certainly the function and the business of _philosophy_. Itis from this point of view that Plato breaks out into the celebrated ornotorious passage where he makes Socrates emphatically state thatphilosophy and political power must coincide, that the Idea must beregent, if the distress of nations is to see its end. What Plato thusdefinitely set before his mind was that the Idea—which implicitly indeedis the free self-determining thought—could not get into consciousness saveonly in the form of a thought; that the substance of the thought couldonly be true when set forth as a universal, and as such brought toconsciousness under its most abstract form."|FALSE
39064|"To compare the Platonic standpoint in all its definiteness with the pointof view from which the relationship of state and religion is hereregarded, the notional differences on which everything turns must berecalled to mind. The first of these is that in natural things theirsubstance or genus is different from their existence in which thatsubstance is as subject: further that this subjective existence of thegenus is distinct from that which it gets, when specially set in relief asgenus, or, to put it simply, as the universal in a mental concept or idea.This additional “individuality”—the soil on which the universal andunderlying principle _freely_ and expressly exists,—is the intellectualand thinking _self_. In the case of _natural_ things their truth andreality does not get the form of universality and essentiality throughthemselves, and their “individuality” is not itself the form: the form isonly found in subjective thinking, which in philosophy gives thatuniversal truth and reality an existence of its own. In man’s case it isotherwise: his truth and reality is the free mind itself, and it comes toexistence in his self-consciousness. This absolute nucleus of man—mindintrinsically concrete—is just this—to have the form (to have thinking)itself for a content. To the height of the thinking consciousness of thisprinciple Aristotle ascended in his notion of the entelechy of thought,(which is νοῆσις τῆς νοήσεως), thus surmounting the Platonic Idea (thegenus, or essential being). But thought always—and that on account of thisvery principle—contains the immediate self-subsistence of subjectivity noless than it contains universality; the genuine Idea of the intrinsicallyconcrete mind is just as essentially under the one of its terms(subjective consciousness) as under the other (universality): and in theone as in the other it is the same substantial content. Under thesubjective form, however, fall feeling, intuition, pictorialrepresentation: and it is in fact necessary that in point of time theconsciousness of the absolute Idea should be first reached and apprehendedin this form: in other words, it must exist in its immediate reality asreligion, earlier than it does as philosophy. Philosophy is a laterdevelopment from this basis (just as Greek philosophy itself is later thanGreek religion), and in fact reaches its completion by catching andcomprehending in all its definite essentiality that principle of spiritwhich first manifests itself in religion. But Greek philosophy could setitself up only in opposition to Greek religion: the unity of thought andthe substantiality of the Idea could take up none but a hostile attitudeto an imaginative polytheism, and to the gladsome and frivolous humours ofits poetic creations. The _form_ in its infinite truth, the _subjectivity_of mind, broke forth at first only as a subjective free _thinking_, whichwas not yet identical with the _substantiality_ itself,—and thus thisunderlying principle was not yet apprehended as _absolute mind_. Thusreligion might appear as first purified only through philosophy,—throughpure self-existent thought: but the form pervading this underlyingprinciple—the form which philosophy attacked—was that creativeimagination."|FALSE
39064|"Political power, which is developed similarly, but earlier thanphilosophy, from religion, exhibits the onesidedness, which in the actualworld may infect its _implicitly_ true Idea, as demoralisation. Plato, incommon with all his thinking contemporaries, perceived this demoralisationof democracy and the defectiveness even of its principle; he set in reliefaccordingly the underlying principle of the state, but could not work intohis idea of it the infinite form of subjectivity, which still escaped hisintelligence. His state is therefore, on its own showing, wanting insubjective liberty (§ 503 note, § 513, &c.). The truth which should beimmanent in the state, should knit it together and control it, he, forthese reasons, got hold of only the form of thought-out truth, ofphilosophy; and hence he makes that utterance that “so long asphilosophers do not rule in the states, or those who are now called kingsand rulers do not soundly and comprehensively philosophise, so longneither the state nor the race of men can be liberated from evils,—so longwill the idea of the political constitution fall short of possibility andnot see the light of the sun.” It was not vouchsafed to Plato to go on sofar as to say that so long as true religion did not spring up in the worldand hold sway in political life, so long the genuine principle of thestate had not come into actuality. But so long too this principle couldnot emerge even in thought, nor could thought lay hold of the genuine ideaof the state,—the idea of the substantial moral life, with which isidentical the liberty of an independent self-consciousness. Only in theprinciple of mind, which is aware of its own essence, is implicitly inabsolute liberty, and has its actuality in the act of self-liberation,does the absolute possibility and necessity exist for political power,religion, and the principles of philosophy coinciding in one, and foraccomplishing the reconciliation of actuality in general with the mind, ofthe state with the religious conscience as well as with the philosophicalconsciousness. Self-realising subjectivity is in this case absolutelyidentical with substantial universality. Hence religion as such, and thestate as such,—both as forms in which the principle exists—each containthe absolute truth: so that the truth, in its philosophic phase, is afterall only in one of its forms. But even religion, as it grows and expands,lets other aspects of the Idea of humanity grow and expand also (§ 500sqq.). As it is left therefore behind, in its first immediate, and so alsoone-sided phase, Religion may, or rather _must_, appear in its existencedegraded to sensuous externality, and thus in the sequel become aninfluence to oppress liberty of spirit and to deprave political life.Still the principle has in it the infinite “elasticity” of the “absolute”form, so as to overcome this depraving of the form-determination (and ofthe content by these means), and to bring about the reconciliation of thespirit in itself. Thus ultimately, in the Protestant conscience theprinciples of the religious and of the ethical conscience come to be oneand the same: the free spirit learning to see itself in its reasonablenessand truth. In the Protestant state, the constitution and the code, as wellas their several applications, embody the principle and the development ofthe moral life, which proceeds and can only proceed from the truth ofreligion, when reinstated in its original principle and in that way assuch first become actual.

39064|"As regards the close connexion of art with the various religions it may bespecially noted that _beautiful_ art can only belong to those religions inwhich the spiritual principle, though concrete and intrinsically free, isnot yet absolute. In religions where the Idea has not yet been revealedand known in its free character, though the craving for art is felt inorder to bring in imaginative visibility to consciousness the idea of thesupreme being, and though art is the sole organ in which the abstract andradically indistinct content,—a mixture from natural and spiritualsources,—can try to bring itself to consciousness;—still this art isdefective; its form is defective because its subject-matter and theme isso,—for the defect in subject-matter comes from the form not beingimmanent in it. The representations of this symbolic art keep a certaintastelessness and stolidity—for the principle it embodies is itself stolidand dull, and hence has not the power freely to transmute the external tosignificance and shape. Beautiful art, on the contrary, has for itscondition the self-consciousness of the free spirit,—the consciousnessthat compared with it the natural and sensuous has no standing of its own:it makes the natural wholly into the mere expression of spirit, which isthus the inner form that gives utterance to itself alone."|FALSE
39064|"But with a further and deeper study, we see that the advent of art, in areligion still in the bonds of sensuous externality, shows that suchreligion is on the decline. At the very time it seems to give religion thesupreme glorification, expression and brilliancy, it has lifted thereligion away over its limitation. In the sublime divinity to which thework of art succeeds in giving expression the artistic genius and thespectator find themselves at home, with their personal sense and feeling,satisfied and liberated: to them the vision and the consciousness of freespirit has been vouchsafed and attained. Beautiful art, from its side, hasthus performed the same service as philosophy: it has purified the spiritfrom its thraldom. The older religion in which the need of fine art, andjust for that reason, is first generated, looks up in its principle to another-world which is sensuous and unmeaning: the images adored by itsdevotees are hideous idols regarded as wonder-working talismans, whichpoint to the unspiritual objectivity of that other world,—and bonesperform a similar or even a better service than such images. But even fineart is only a grade of liberation, not the supreme liberation itself.—Thegenuine objectivity, which is only in the medium of thought,—the medium inwhich alone the pure spirit is for the spirit, and where the liberation isaccompanied with reverence,—is still absent in the sensuous beauty of thework of art, still more in that external, unbeautiful sensuousness."|FALSE

These assertions (and more than assertions they are not) are the moreillogical, because made within a religion which is expressly called therevealed; for according to them it would rather be the religion in whichnothing of God was revealed, in which he had not revealed himself, andthose belonging to it would be the heathen “who know not God.” If the wordof God is taken in earnest in religion at all, it is from Him, the themeand centre of religion, that the method of divine knowledge may and mustbegin: and if self-revelation is refused Him, then the only thing left toconstitute His nature would be to ascribe envy to Him.

39064|"Here might seem to be the place to treat in a definite exposition of thereciprocal relations of philosophy and religion. The whole question turnsentirely on the difference of the forms of speculative thought from theforms of mental representation and “reflecting” intellect. But it is thewhole cycle of philosophy, and of logic in particular, which has notmerely taught and made known this difference, but also criticised it, orrather has let its nature develop and judge itself by these verycategories. It is only by an insight into the value of these forms thatthe true and needful conviction can be gained, that the content ofreligion and philosophy is the same,—leaving out, of course, the furtherdetails of external nature and finite mind which fall outside the range ofreligion. But religion is the truth _for all men_: faith rests on thewitness of the spirit, which as witnessing is the spirit in man. Thiswitness—the underlying essence in all humanity—takes, when driven toexpound itself, its first definite form under those acquired habits ofthought which his secular consciousness and intellect otherwise employs.In this way the truth becomes liable to the terms and conditions offinitude in general. This does not prevent the spirit, even in employingsensuous ideas and finite categories of thought, from retaining itscontent (which as religion is essentially speculative,) with a tenacitywhich does violence to them, and acts _inconsistently_ towards them. Bythis inconsistency it corrects their defects. Nothing easier therefore forthe “Rationalist” than to point out contradictions in the exposition ofthe faith, and then to prepare triumphs for its principle of formalidentity. If the spirit yields to this finite reflection, which hasusurped the title of reason and philosophy—(“Rationalism”)—it stripsreligious truth of its infinity and makes it in reality nought. Religionin that case is completely in the right in guarding herself against suchreason and philosophy and treating them as enemies. But it is anotherthing when religion sets herself against comprehending reason, and againstphilosophy in general, and specially against a philosophy of which thedoctrine is speculative, and so religious. Such an opposition proceedsfrom failure to appreciate the difference indicated and the value ofspiritual form in general, and particularly of the logical form; or, to bemore precise, still from failure to note the distinction of thecontent—which may be in both the same—from these forms. It is on theground of form that philosophy has been reproached and accused by thereligious party; just as conversely its speculative content has broughtthe same charges upon it from a self-styled philosophy—and from a pithlessorthodoxy. It had too little of God in it for the former; too much for thelatter."|FALSE
39064|"The charge of _Atheism_, which used often to be brought against philosophy(that it has _too little_ of God), has grown rare: the more wide-spreadgrows the charge of Pantheism, that it has _too much_ of him:—so much so,that it is treated not so much as an imputation, but as a proved fact, ora sheer fact which needs no proof. Piety, in particular, which with itspious airs of superiority fancies itself free to dispense with proof, goeshand in hand with empty rationalism—(which means to be so much opposed toit, though both repose really on the same habit of mind)—in the wantonassertion, almost as if it merely mentioned a notorious fact, thatPhilosophy is the All-one doctrine, or Pantheism. It must be said that itwas more to the credit of piety and theology when they accused aphilosophical system (e.g. Spinozism) of Atheism than of Pantheism, thoughthe former imputation at the first glance looks more cruel and insidious(cf. § 71 note). The imputation of Atheism presupposes a definite idea ofa full and real God, and arises because the popular idea does not detectin the philosophical notion the peculiar form to which it is attached.Philosophy indeed can recognise its own forms in the categories ofreligious consciousness, and even its own teaching in the doctrine ofreligion—which therefore it does not disparage. But the converse is nottrue: the religious consciousness does not apply the criticism of thoughtto itself, does not comprehend itself, and is therefore, as it stands,exclusive. To impute Pantheism instead of Atheism to Philosophy is part ofthe modern habit of mind—of the new piety and new theology. For themphilosophy has too much of God:—so much so, that, if we believe them, itasserts that God is everything and everything is God. This new theology,which makes religion only a subjective feeling and denies the knowledge ofthe divine nature, thus retains nothing more than a God in general withoutobjective characteristics. Without interest of its own for the concrete,fulfilled notion of God, it treats it only as an interest which _others_once had, and hence treats what belongs to the doctrine of God’s concretenature as something merely historical. The indeterminate God is to befound in all religions; every kind of piety (§ 72)—that of the Hindoo toasses, cows,—or to dalai-lamas,—that of the Egyptians to the ox—is alwaysadoration of an object which, with all its absurdities, also contains thegeneric abstract, God in General. If this theory needs no more than such aGod, so as to find God in everything called religion, it must at leastfind such a God recognised even in philosophy, and can no longer accuse itof Atheism. The mitigation of the reproach of Atheism into that ofPantheism has its ground therefore in the superficial idea to which thismildness has attenuated and emptied God. As that popular idea clings toits abstract universality, from which all definite quality is excluded,all such definiteness is only the non-divine, the secularity of things,thus left standing in fixed undisturbed substantiality. On such apresupposition, even after philosophy has maintained God’s absoluteuniversality, and the consequent untruth of the being of external things,the hearer clings as he did before to his belief that secular things stillkeep their being, and form all that is definite in the divineuniversality. He thus changes that universality into what he calls thepantheistic:—_Everything is_—(empirical things, without distinction,whether higher or lower in the scale, _are_)—all possess substantiality;and so—thus he understands philosophy—each and every secular thing is God.It is only his own stupidity, and the falsifications due to suchmisconception, which generate the imagination and the allegation of suchpantheism."|FALSE
39064|"But if those who give out that a certain philosophy is Pantheism, areunable and unwilling to see this—for it is just to see the notion thatthey refuse—they should before everything have verified the alleged factthat _any one philosopher, or any one man_, had really ascribedsubstantial or objective and inherent reality to _all_ things and regardedthem as God:—that such an idea had ever come into the hand of any body butthemselves. This allegation I will further elucidate in this exotericdiscussion: and the only way to do so is to set down the evidence. If wewant to take so-called Pantheism in its most poetical, most sublime, or ifyou will, its grossest shape, we must, as is well known, consult theoriental poets: and the most copious delineations of it are found inHindoo literature. Amongst the abundant resources open to our disposal onthis topic, I select—as the most authentic statement accessible—theBhagavat-Gita, and amongst its effusions, prolix and reiterative _adnauseam_, some of the most telling passages. In the 10th Lesson (inSchlegel, p. 162) Krishna says of himself(173):—“I am the self, seated inthe hearts of all beings. I am the beginning and the middle and the endalso of all beings ... I am the beaming sun amongst the shining ones, andthe moon among the lunar mansions.... Amongst the Vedas I am theSâma-Veda: I am mind amongst the senses: I am consciousness in livingbeings. And I am Sankara (Siva) among the Rudras, ... Meru among thehigh-topped mountains, ... the Himalaya among the firmly-fixed(mountains).... Among beasts I am the lord of beasts.... Among letters Iam the letter A.... I am the spring among the seasons.... I am also thatwhich is the seed of all things: there is nothing moveable or immoveablewhich can exist without me.”"|FALSE
39064|"Even in these totally sensuous delineations, Krishna (and we must notsuppose there is, besides Krishna, still God, or a God besides; as he saidbefore he was Siva, or Indra, so it is afterwards said that Brahma too isin him) makes himself out to be—not everything, but only—the mostexcellent of everything. Everywhere there is a distinction drawn betweenexternal, unessential existences, and one essential amongst them, which heis. Even when, at the beginning of the passage, he is said to be thebeginning, middle, and end of living things, this totality isdistinguished from the living things themselves as single existences. Evensuch a picture which extends deity far and wide in its existence cannot becalled pantheism: we must rather say that in the infinitely multipleempirical world, everything is reduced to a limited number of essentialexistences, to a polytheism. But even what has been quoted shows thatthese very substantialities of the externally-existent do not retain theindependence entitling them to be named Gods; even Siva, Indra, &c. meltinto the one Krishna."|FALSE
39064|"This reduction is more expressly made in the following scene (7th Lesson,p. 7 sqq.). Krishna says: “I am the producer and the destroyer of thewhole universe. There is nothing else higher than myself; all this iswoven upon me, like numbers of pearls upon a thread. I am the taste inwater;... I am the light of the sun and the moon; I am ‘Om’ in all theVedas.... I am life in all beings.... I am the discernment of thediscerning ones.... I am also the strength of the strong.” Then he adds:“The whole universe deluded by these three states of mind developed fromthe qualities [sc. goodness, passion, darkness] does not know me who ambeyond them and inexhaustible: for this delusion of mine,” [even the Mayais _his_, nothing independent], “developed from the qualities is divineand difficult to transcend. Those cross beyond this delusion who resort tome alone.” Then the picture gathers itself up in a simple expression: “Atthe end of many lives, the man possessed of knowledge approaches me,(believing) that Vasudeva is everything. Such a high-souled mind is veryhard to find. Those who are deprived of knowledge by various desiresapproach other divinities... Whichever form of deity one worships withfaith, from it he obtains the beneficial things he desires really given byme. But the fruit thus obtained by those of little judgment isperishable.... The undiscerning ones, not knowing my transcendent andinexhaustible essence, than which there is nothing higher, think me who amunperceived to have become perceptible.”"|FALSE
39064|"This “All,” which Krishna calls himself, is not, any more than the EleaticOne, and the Spinozan Substance, the Every-thing. This every-thing,rather, the infinitely-manifold sensuous manifold of the finite is in allthese pictures, but defined as the “accidental,” without essential beingof its very own, but having its truth in the substance, the One which, asdifferent from that accidental, is alone the divine and God. Hindooismhowever has the higher conception of Brahma, the pure unity of thought initself, where the empirical everything of the world, as also thoseproximate substantialities, called Gods, vanish. On that accountColebrooke and many others have described the Hindoo religion as at bottoma Monotheism. That this description is not incorrect is clear from theseshort citations. But so little concrete is this divine unity—spiritual asits idea of God is—so powerless its grip, so to speak—that Hindooism, witha monstrous inconsistency, is also the maddest of polytheisms. But theidolatry of the wretched Hindoo, when he adores the ape, or othercreature, is still a long way from that wretched fancy of a Pantheism, towhich everything is God, and God everything. Hindoo monotheism moreover isitself an example how little comes of mere monotheism, if the Idea of Godis not deeply determinate in itself. For that unity, if it beintrinsically abstract and therefore empty, tends of itself to letwhatever is concrete, outside it—be it as a lot of Gods or as secular,empirical individuals—keep its independence. That pantheism indeed—on theshallow conception of it—might with a show of logic as well be called amonotheism: for if God, as it says, is identical with the world, then asthere is only one world there would be in that pantheism only one God.Perhaps the empty numerical unity must be predicated of the world: butsuch abstract predication of it has no further special interest; on thecontrary, a mere numerical unity just means that its _content_ is aninfinite multeity and variety of finitudes. But it is that delusion withthe empty unity, which alone makes possible and induces the wrong idea ofpantheism. It is only the picture—floating in the indefinite blue—of theworld as _one thing_, _the all_, that could ever be considered capable ofcombining with God: only on that assumption could philosophy be supposedto teach that God is the world: for if the world were taken as it is, aseverything, as the endless lot of empirical existence, then it wouldhardly have been even held possible to suppose a pantheism which assertedof such stuff that it is God."|FALSE
39064|"But to go back again to the question of fact. If we want to see theconsciousness of the One—not as with the Hindoos split between thefeatureless unity of abstract thought, on one hand, and on the other, thelong-winded weary story of its particular detail, but—in its finest purityand sublimity, we must consult the Mohammedans. If e.g. in the excellentJelaleddin-Rumi in particular, we find the unity of the soul with the Oneset forth, and that unity described as love, this spiritual unity is anexaltation above the finite and vulgar, a transfiguration of the naturaland the spiritual, in which the externalism and transitoriness ofimmediate nature, and of empirical secular spirit, is discarded andabsorbed(174)."|FALSE
39064|"I refrain from accumulating further examples of the religious and poeticconceptions which it is customary to call pantheistic. Of the philosophiesto which that name is given, the Eleatic, or Spinozist, it has beenremarked earlier (§ 50, note) that so far are they from identifying Godwith the world and making him finite, that in these systems this“everything” has no truth, and that we should rather call themmonotheistic, or, in relation to the popular idea of the world, acosmical.They are most accurately called systems which apprehend the Absolute onlyas substance. Of the oriental, especially the Mohammedan, modes ofenvisaging God, we may rather say that they represent the Absolute as theutterly universal genus which dwells in the species or existences, butdwells so potently that these existences have no actual reality. The faultof all these modes of thought and systems is that they stop short ofdefining substance as subject and as mind."|FALSE
39064|"These systems and modes of pictorial conception originate from the oneneed common to all philosophies and all religions of getting an idea ofGod, and, secondly, of the relationship of God and the world. (Inphilosophy it is specially made out that the determination of God’s naturedetermines his relations with the world.) The “reflective” understandingbegins by rejecting all systems and modes of conception, which, whetherthey spring from heart, imagination or speculation, express theinterconnexion of God and the world: and in order to have God pure infaith or consciousness, he is as essence parted from appearance, asinfinite from the finite. But, after this partition, the conviction arisesalso that the appearance has a relation to the essence, the finite to theinfinite, and so on: and thus arises the question of reflection as to thenature of this relation. It is in the reflective form that the wholedifficulty of the affair lies, and that causes this relation to be calledincomprehensible by the agnostic. The close of philosophy is not theplace, even in a general exoteric discussion, to waste a word on what a“notion” means. But as the view taken of this relation is closelyconnected with the view taken of philosophy generally and with allimputations against it, we may still add the remark that though philosophycertainly has to do with unity in general, it is not however with abstractunity, mere identity, and the empty absolute, but with concrete unity (thenotion), and that in its whole course it has to do with nothing else;—thateach step in its advance is a peculiar term or phase of this concreteunity, and that the deepest and last expression of unity is the unity ofabsolute mind itself. Would-be judges and critics of philosophy might berecommended to familiarise themselves with these phases of unity and totake the trouble to get acquainted with them, at least to know so muchthat of these terms there are a great many, and that amongst them there isgreat variety. But they show so little acquaintance with them—and stillless take trouble about it—that, when they hear of unity—and relation_ipso facto_ implies unity—they rather stick fast at quite abstractindeterminate unity, and lose sight of the chief point of interest—thespecial mode in which the unity is qualified. Hence all they can say aboutphilosophy is that dry identity is its principle and result, and that itis the system of identity. Sticking fast to the undigested thought ofidentity, they have laid hands on, not the concrete unity, the notion andcontent of philosophy, but rather its reverse. In the philosophical fieldthey proceed, as in the physical field the physicist; who also is wellaware that he has before him a variety of sensuous properties andmatters—or usually matters alone, (for the properties get transformed intomatters also for the physicist)—and that these matters (elements) _also_stand in _relation_ to one another. But the question is, Of what kind isthis relation? Every peculiarity and the whole difference of naturalthings, inorganic and living, depend solely on the different modes of thisunity. But instead of ascertaining these different modes, the ordinaryphysicist (chemist included) takes up only one, the most external and theworst, viz. _composition_, applies only it in the whole range of naturalstructures, which he thus renders for ever inexplicable."|FALSE
39064|"The aforesaid shallow pantheism is an equally obvious inference from thisshallow identity. All that those who employ this invention of their own toaccuse philosophy gather from the study of God’s _relation_ to the worldis that the one, but only the one factor of this category of relation—andthat the factor of indeterminateness—is identity. Thereupon they stickfast in this half-perception, and assert—falsely as a fact—that philosophyteaches the identity of God and the world. And as in their judgment eitherof the two,—the world as much as God—has the same solid substantiality asthe other, they infer that in the philosophic Idea God is _composed_ ofGod and the world. Such then is the idea they form of pantheism, and whichthey ascribe to philosophy. Unaccustomed in their own thinking andapprehending of thoughts to go beyond such categories, they import theminto philosophy, where they are utterly unknown; they thus infect it withthe disease against which they subsequently raise an outcry. If anydifficulty emerge in comprehending God’s relation to the world, they atonce and very easily escape it by admitting that this relation containsfor them an inexplicable contradiction; and that hence, they must stop atthe vague conception of such relation, perhaps under the more familiarnames of, e.g. omnipresence, providence, &c. Faith in their use of theterm means no more than a refusal to define the conception, or to enter ona closer discussion of the problem. That men and classes of untrainedintellect are satisfied with such indefiniteness, is what one expects; butwhen a trained intellect and an interest for reflective study issatisfied, in matters admitted to be of superior, if not even of supremeinterest, with indefinite ideas, it is hard to decide whether the thinkeris really in earnest with the subject. But if those who cling to thiscrude “rationalism” were in earnest, e.g. with God’s omnipresence, so faras to realise their faith thereon in a definite mental idea, in whatdifficulties would they be involved by their belief in the true reality ofthe things of sense! They would hardly like, as Epicurus does, to let Goddwell in the interspaces of things, i.e. in the pores of thephysicists,—said pores being the negative, something supposed to exist_beside_ the material reality. This very “Beside” would give theirpantheism its spatiality,—their everything, conceived as the mutualexclusion of parts in space. But in ascribing to God, in his relation tothe world, an action on and in the space thus filled on the world and init, they would endlessly split up the divine actuality into infinitemateriality. They would really thus have the misconception they callpantheism or all-one-doctrine, only as the necessary sequel of theirmisconceptions of God and the world. But to put that sort of thing, thisstale gossip of oneness or identity, on the shoulders of philosophy, showssuch recklessness about justice and truth that it can only be explainedthrough the difficulty of getting into the head thoughts and notions, i.e.not abstract unity, but the many-shaped modes specified. If statements asto facts are put forward, and the facts in question are thoughts andnotions, it is indispensable to get hold of their meaning. But even thefulfilment of this requirement has been rendered superfluous, now that ithas long been a foregone conclusion that philosophy is pantheism, a systemof identity, an All-one doctrine, and that the person therefore who mightbe unaware of this fact is treated either as merely unaware of a matter ofcommon notoriety, or as prevaricating for a purpose. On account of thischorus of assertions, then, I have believed myself obliged to speak atmore length and exoterically on the outward and inward untruth of thisalleged fact: for exoteric discussion is the only method available indealing with the external apprehension of notions as mere facts,—by whichnotions are perverted into their opposite. The esoteric study of God andidentity, as of cognitions and notions, is philosophy itself."|FALSE
39064|"§ 574. This notion of philosophy is the self-thinking Idea, the truthaware of itself (§ 236),—the logical system, but with the significationthat it is universality approved and certified in concrete content as inits actuality. In this way the science has gone back to its beginning: itsresult is the logical system but as a spiritual principle: out of thepresupposing judgment, in which the notion was only implicit and thebeginning an immediate,—and thus out of the _appearance_ which it hadthere—it has risen into its pure principle and thus also into its propermedium."|FALSE
39064|"§ 575. It is this appearing which originally gives the motive of thefurther development. The first appearance is formed by the syllogism,which is based on the Logical system as starting-point, with Nature forthe middle term which couples the Mind with it. The Logical principleturns to Nature and Nature to Mind. Nature, standing between the Mind andits essence, sunders itself, not indeed to extremes of finite abstraction,nor itself to something away from them and independent,—which, as otherthan they, only serves as a link between them: for the syllogism is _inthe Idea_ and Nature is essentially defined as a transition-point andnegative factor, and as implicitly the Idea. Still the mediation of thenotion has the external form of _transition_, and the science of Naturepresents itself as the course of necessity, so that it is only in the oneextreme that the liberty of the notion is explicit as a self-amalgamation."|FALSE
39064|"§ 576. In the second syllogism this appearance is so far superseded, thatthat syllogism is the standpoint of the Mind itself, which—as themediating agent in the process—presupposes Nature and couples it with theLogical principle. It is the syllogism where Mind reflects on itself inthe Idea: philosophy appears as a subjective cognition, of which libertyis the aim, and which is itself the way to produce it."|FALSE
39064|"§ 577. The third syllogism is the Idea of philosophy, which hasself-knowing reason, the absolutely-universal, for its middle term: amiddle, which divides itself into Mind and Nature, making the former itspresupposition, as process of the Idea’s subjective activity, and thelatter its universal extreme, as process of the objectively and implicitlyexisting Idea. The self-judging of the Idea into its two appearances (§§575, 576) characterises both as its (the self-knowing reason’s)manifestations: and in it there is a unification of the two aspects:—it isthe nature of the fact, the notion, which causes the movement anddevelopment, yet this same movement is equally the action of cognition.The eternal Idea, in full fruition of its essence, eternally sets itselfto work, engenders and enjoys itself as absolute Mind."|FALSE

Plato says in the _Timaeus_ (p. 71), “The author of our being so      ordered our inferior parts that they too might obtain a measure of      truth, and in the liver placed their oracle (the power of divination      by dreams). And herein is a proof that God has given the art of      divination, not to the wisdom, but, to the foolishness of man; for      no man when in his wits attains prophetic truth and inspiration; but      when he receives the inspired word, either his intelligence is      enthralled by sleep, or he is demented by some distemper or      possession (enthusiasm).” Plato very correctly notes not merely the      bodily conditions on which such visionary knowledge depends, and the      possibility of the truth of the dreams, but also the inferiority of      them to the reasonable frame of mind."|FALSE

The copious extracts which Tholuck, in his work _Anthology      from the Eastern Mystics_, gives us from the poems of Jelaleddin and      others, are made from the very point of view now under discussion.      In his Introduction, Herr Tholuck proves how profoundly his soul has      caught the note of mysticism; and there, too, he points out the      characteristic traits of its oriental phase, in distinction from      that of the West and Christendom. With all their divergence,      however, they have in common the mystical character. The conjunction      of Mysticism with so-called Pantheism, as he says (p. 53), implies      that inward quickening of soul and spirit which inevitably tends to      annihilate that external _Everything_, which Pantheism is usually      held to adore. But beyond that, Herr Tholuck leaves matters standing      at the usual indistinct conception of Pantheism; a profounder      discussion of it would have had, for the author’s emotional      Christianity, no direct interest; but we see that personally he is      carried away by remarkable enthusiasm for a mysticism which, in the      ordinary phrase, entirely deserves the epithet Pantheistic. Where,      however, he tries philosophising (p. 12), he does not get beyond the      standpoint of the “rationalist” metaphysic with its uncritical      categories."|FALSE
