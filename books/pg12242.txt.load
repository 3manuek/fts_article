12242|"PREFACE."|FALSE
12242|"The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emersonlong since called \"the Poetry of the Portfolio,\"--something producedabsolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way ofexpression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitablyforfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticismand the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, itmay often gain something through the habit of freedom and theunconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of thepresent author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; shemust write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,literally spending years without setting her foot beyond thedoorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictlylimited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was withgreat difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during herlifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in greatabundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to allconventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its owntenacious fastidiousness."|FALSE
12242|"Miss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and diedthere May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was theleading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-knowncollege there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a largereception at his house, attended by all the families connected withthe institution and by the leading people of the town. On theseoccasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement anddid her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known fromher manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence.The annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,and except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as ifshe had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had correspondedwith her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, andbrought away the impression of something as unique and remote asUndine or Mignon or Thekla."|FALSE
12242|"This selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of herpersonal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It isbelieved that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages aquality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than ofanything to be elsewhere found,--flashes of wholly original andprofound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibitingan extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yetoften set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They arehere published as they were written, with very few and superficialchanges; although it is fair to say that the titles have beenassigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases theseverses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, withrain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness anda fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in thefew poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder atthe gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman candelineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mentalstruggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making thereader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of thesepoems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with anuneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but reallyunsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one'sbreath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskinwrote in his earlier and better days, \"No weight nor mass nor beautyof execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought.\""|FALSE

12242|"PREFACE"|FALSE
12242|"The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson'spoems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modernartificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of thequalities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatestthemes,--life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch,\"as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the verycore of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic asit has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compellingpower.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as toform with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties."|FALSE
12242|"Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sendingoccasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent ofher writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend \"H.H.\"must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5thSeptember, 1884, she wrote:--"|FALSE
12242|"MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of versesyou must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \"day andgeneration\" that you will not give them light."|FALSE
12242|"If such a thing should happen as that I should outliveyou, I wish you would make me your literary legateeand executor. Surely after you are what is called\"dead\" you will be willing that the poor ghosts youhave left behind should be cheered and pleased by yourverses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not thinkwe have a right to withhold from the world a word ora thought any more than a deed which might help asingle soul. . . ."|FALSE

12242|"                        HELEN JACKSON."|FALSE
12242|"The \"portfolios\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems hadbeen carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in littlefascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bearevidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more hadreceived thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition ofrather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words andphrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes oneform, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Withoutimportant exception, her friends have generously placed at thedisposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; andthese have given the obvious advantage of comparison among severalrenderings of the same verse."|FALSE
12242|"To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have beensubjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. Theyshould be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong andsuggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at sometime in the finished picture."|FALSE
12242|"Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in thewinter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors theApril following, she says, \"I made no verse, but one or two, untilthis winter.\""|FALSE
12242|"The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, runningItalian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced inbreadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in herlatest years each letter stood distinct and separate from itsfellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerousdashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect ofa page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint andstrong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one ofthe earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with generalchronologic accuracy."|FALSE
12242|"As a rule, the verses were without titles; but \"A Country Burial,\"\"A Thunder-Storm,\" \"The Humming-Bird,\" and a few others were namedby their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in theaccompanying note, if sent to a friend."|FALSE
12242|"The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote inpencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal ofresponsibility upon her Editors. But all interference notabsolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of herrendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for itseems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother andmore usual rhymes."|FALSE
12242|"Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the veryabsence of conventional form challenges attention. In EmilyDickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of aparticular order of words might not be sacrificed to anythingvirtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence ofinner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, andthe \"thought-rhyme\" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to anunrecognized sense more elusive than hearing."|FALSE
12242|"Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even thesombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. Shetouches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almosthumorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she isnever by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critichas said, she may exhibit toward God \"an Emersonian self-possession,\"it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudicedas it is rare."|FALSE
12242|"She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  Shewas not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from nolove-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a natureintrospective to a high degree, whose best thought could not existin pretence."|FALSE
12242|"Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds andbees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trustedhuman friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of thefirst robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday ofpope; the first red leaf hurrying through \"the altered air,\" anepoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid ormelancholy, she lived in its presence."|FALSE

12242|"The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great thata large and characteristic choice is still possible among herliterary material, and this third volume of her verses is putforth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of herpeculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines."|FALSE
12242|"Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends inletters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them inthis Series, and all have been omitted, except three or fourexceptionally strong ones, as \"A Book,\" and \"With Flowers.\""|FALSE
12242|"There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simplyspontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outwardcircumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;for example, the verses \"I had a Guinea golden,\" which seem tohave been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a daintyreminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings inwhich any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have beenwritten usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general thepresent volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation tothose who apprehend this scintillating spirit."|FALSE
