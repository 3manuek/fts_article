836|"CHAPTER 1. THE EGG"|FALSE
836|"It began with the day when it was almost the Fifth of November, and adoubt arose in some breast--Robert's, I fancy--as to the quality of thefireworks laid in for the Guy Fawkes celebration."|FALSE
836|"'They were jolly cheap,' said whoever it was, and I think it was Robert,'and suppose they didn't go off on the night? Those Prosser kids wouldhave something to snigger about then.'"|FALSE
836|"'The ones _I_ got are all right,' Jane said; 'I know they are, becausethe man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money--'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm sure thribble isn't grammar,' Anthea said."|FALSE
836|"'Of course it isn't,' said Cyril; 'one word can't be grammar all byitself, so you needn't be so jolly clever.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea was rummaging in the corner-drawers of her mind for a verydisagreeable answer, when she remembered what a wet day it was, and howthe boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on thetop of the tram, which their mother had promised them as a reward fornot having once forgotten, for six whole days, to wipe their boots onthe mat when they came home from school."|FALSE
836|"So Anthea only said, 'Don't be so jolly clever yourself, Squirrel. Andthe fireworks look all right, and you'll have the eightpence that yourtram fares didn't cost to-day, to buy something more with. You ought toget a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence.'"|FALSE
836|"'I daresay,' said Cyril, coldly; 'but it's not YOUR eightpence anyhow--'"|FALSE
836|"'But look here,' said Robert, 'really now, about the fireworks. We don'twant to be disgraced before those kids next door. They think becausethey wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wouldn't wear plush if it was ever so--unless it was black to bebeheaded in, if I was Mary Queen of Scots,' said Anthea, with scorn."|FALSE
836|"Robert stuck steadily to his point. One great point about Robert is thesteadiness with which he can stick."|FALSE
836|"'I think we ought to test them,' he said."|FALSE
836|"'You young duffer,' said Cyril, 'fireworks are like postage-stamps. Youcan only use them once.'"|FALSE
836|"'What do you suppose it means by \"Carter's tested seeds\" in theadvertisement?'"|FALSE
836|"There was a blank silence. Then Cyril touched his forehead with hisfinger and shook his head."|FALSE
836|"'A little wrong here,' he said. 'I was always afraid of that with poorRobert. All that cleverness, you know, and being top in algebra sooften--it's bound to tell--'"|FALSE
836|"'Dry up,' said Robert, fiercely. 'Don't you see? You can't TEST seeds ifyou do them ALL. You just take a few here and there, and if thosegrow you can feel pretty sure the others will be--what do you callit?--Father told me--\"up to sample\". Don't you think we ought to samplethe fire-works? Just shut our eyes and each draw one out, and then trythem.'"|FALSE
836|"'But it's raining cats and dogs,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'And Queen Anne is dead,' rejoined Robert. No one was in a very goodtemper. 'We needn't go out to do them; we can just move back the table,and let them off on the old tea-tray we play toboggans with. I don'tknow what YOU think, but _I_ think it's time we did something, andthat would be really useful; because then we shouldn't just HOPE thefireworks would make those Prossers sit up--we should KNOW.'"|FALSE
836|"'It WOULD be something to do,' Cyril owned with languid approval."|FALSE
836|"So the table was moved back. And then the hole in the carpet, thathad been near the window till the carpet was turned round, showed mostawfully. But Anthea stole out on tip-toe, and got the tray when cookwasn't looking, and brought it in and put it over the hole."|FALSE
836|"Then all the fireworks were put on the table, and each of the fourchildren shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and graspedsomething. Robert took a cracker, Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles;but Jane's fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection, theJack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings, and one at least of theparty--I will not say which, because it was sorry afterwards--declaredthat Jane had done it on purpose. Nobody was pleased. For the worst ofit was that these four children, with a very proper dislike of anythingeven faintly bordering on the sneakish, had a law, unalterable as thoseof the Medes and Persians, that one had to stand by the results of atoss-up, or a drawing of lots, or any other appeal to chance, howevermuch one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out."|FALSE
836|"'I didn't mean to,' said Jane, near tears. 'I don't care, I'll drawanother--'"|FALSE
836|"'You know jolly well you can't,' said Cyril, bitterly. 'It's settled.It's Medium and Persian. You've done it, and you'll have to stand byit--and us too, worse luck. Never mind. YOU'LL have your pocket-moneybefore the Fifth. Anyway, we'll have the Jack-in-the-box LAST, and getthe most out of it we can.'"|FALSE
836|"So the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted, and they wereall that could be expected for the money; but when it came to theJack-in-the-box it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them, as Cyrilsaid. They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it withmatches; they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocketof father's second-best overcoat that was hanging in the hall. And thenAnthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the broomsand dustpans were kept, and the rosiny fire-lighters that smell so niceand like the woods where pine-trees grow, and the old newspapers and thebees-wax and turpentine, and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are usedfor cleaning brass and furniture, and the paraffin for the lamps. Shecame back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpence-halfpenny whenit was full of red-currant jelly; but the jelly had been all eaten longago, and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin. She came in, andshe threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril wastrying with the twenty-third match to light the Jack-in-the-box. TheJack-in-the-box did not catch fire any more than usual, but the paraffinacted quite differently, and in an instant a hot flash of flame leaptup and burnt off Cyril's eyelashes, and scorched the faces of allfour before they could spring back. They backed, in four instantaneousbounds, as far as they could, which was to the wall, and the pillar offire reached from floor to ceiling."|FALSE
836|"'My hat,' said Cyril, with emotion, 'You've done it this time, Anthea.'"|FALSE
836|"The flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire inMr Rider Haggard's exciting story about Allan Quatermain. Robert andCyril saw that no time was to be lost. They turned up the edges of thecarpet, and kicked them over the tray. This cut off the column of fire,and it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadfulsmell of lamps that have been turned too low."|FALSE
836|"All hands now rushed to the rescue, and the paraffin fire was only abundle of trampled carpet, when suddenly a sharp crack beneath theirfeet made the amateur firemen start back. Another crack--the carpetmoved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it; the Jack-in-the-box had atlast allowed itself to be lighted, and it was going off with desperateviolence inside the carpet."|FALSE
836|"Robert, with the air of one doing the only possible thing, rushed to thewindow and opened it. Anthea screamed, Jane burst into tears, andCyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap. But thefirework went on, banging and bursting and spluttering even underneaththe table."|FALSE
836|"Next moment mother rushed in, attracted by the howls of Anthea, and in afew moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence, andthe children stood looking at each other's black faces, and, out of thecorners of their eyes, at mother's white one."|FALSE
836|"The fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but littlesurprise, nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove theimmediate end of the adventure. It has been said that all roads lead toRome; this may be true, but at any rate, in early youth I am quite surethat many roads lead to BED, and stop there--or YOU do."|FALSE
836|"The rest of the fireworks were confiscated, and mother was not pleasedwhen father let them off himself in the back garden, though he said,'Well, how else can you get rid of them, my dear?'"|FALSE
836|"You see, father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace, andthat their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden. So thatthey all saw the fireworks most beautifully, and admired the skill withwhich father handled them."|FALSE
836|"Next day all was forgotten and forgiven; only the nursery had tobe deeply cleaned (like spring-cleaning), and the ceiling had to bewhitewashed."|FALSE
836|"And mother went out; and just at tea-time next day a man came with arolled-up carpet, and father paid him, and mother said--"|FALSE
836|"'If the carpet isn't in good condition, you know, I shall expect you tochange it.' And the man replied--"|FALSE
836|"'There ain't a thread gone in it nowhere, mum. It's a bargain, if everthere was one, and I'm more'n 'arf sorry I let it go at the price; butwe can't resist the lydies, can we, sir?' and he winked at father andwent away."|FALSE
836|"Then the carpet was put down in the nursery, and sure enough therewasn't a hole in it anywhere."|FALSE
836|"As the last fold was unrolled something hard and loud-sounding bumpedout of it and trundled along the nursery floor. All the childrenscrambled for it, and Cyril got it. He took it to the gas. It was shapedlike an egg, very yellow and shiny, half-transparent, and it had an oddsort of light in it that changed as you held it in different ways. Itwas as though it was an egg with a yolk of pale fire that just showedthrough the stone."|FALSE
836|"'I MAY keep it, mayn't I, mother?' Cyril asked."|FALSE
836|"And of course mother said no; they must take it back to the man who hadbrought the carpet, because she had only paid for a carpet, and not fora stone egg with a fiery yolk to it."|FALSE
836|"So she told them where the shop was, and it was in the Kentish TownRoad, not far from the hotel that is called the Bull and Gate. It wasa poky little shop, and the man was arranging furniture outside on thepavement very cunningly, so that the more broken parts should show aslittle as possible. And directly he saw the children he knew them again,and he began at once, without giving them a chance to speak."|FALSE
836|"'No you don't' he cried loudly; 'I ain't a-goin' to take back nocarpets, so don't you make no bloomin' errer. A bargain's a bargain, andthe carpet's puffik throughout.'"|FALSE
836|"'We don't want you to take it back,' said Cyril; 'but we found somethingin it.'"|FALSE
836|"'It must have got into it up at your place, then,' said the man, withindignant promptness, 'for there ain't nothing in nothing as I sell.It's all as clean as a whistle.'"|FALSE
836|"'I never said it wasn't CLEAN,' said Cyril, 'but--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, if it's MOTHS,' said the man, 'that's easy cured with borax. But Iexpect it was only an odd one. I tell you the carpet's good through andthrough. It hadn't got no moths when it left my 'ands--not so much as anhegg.'"|FALSE
836|"'But that's just it,' interrupted Jane; 'there WAS so much as an egg.'"|FALSE
836|"The man made a sort of rush at the children and stamped his foot."|FALSE
836|"'Clear out, I say!' he shouted, 'or I'll call for the police. A nicething for customers to 'ear you a-coming 'ere a-charging me with findingthings in goods what I sells. 'Ere, be off, afore I sends you off with aflea in your ears. Hi! constable--'"|FALSE
836|"The children fled, and they think, and their father thinks, that theycouldn't have done anything else. Mother has her own opinion."|FALSE
836|"But father said they might keep the egg."|FALSE
836|"'The man certainly didn't know the egg was there when he brought thecarpet,' said he, 'any more than your mother did, and we've as muchright to it as he had.'"|FALSE
836|"So the egg was put on the mantelpiece, where it quite brightened up thedingy nursery. The nursery was dingy, because it was a basement room,and its windows looked out on a stone area with a rockery made ofclinkers facing the windows. Nothing grew in the rockery except Londonpride and snails."|FALSE
836|"The room had been described in the house agent's list as a 'convenientbreakfast-room in basement,' and in the daytime it was rather dark. Thisdid not matter so much in the evenings when the gas was alight, but thenit was in the evening that the blackbeetles got so sociable, and used tocome out of the low cupboards on each side of the fireplace where theirhomes were, and try to make friends with the children. At least, Isuppose that was what they wanted, but the children never would."|FALSE
836|"On the Fifth of November father and mother went to the theatre, andthe children were not happy, because the Prossers next door had lots offireworks and they had none."|FALSE
836|"They were not even allowed to have a bonfire in the garden."|FALSE
836|"'No more playing with fire, thank you,' was father's answer, when theyasked him."|FALSE
836|"When the baby had been put to bed the children sat sadly round the firein the nursery."|FALSE
836|"'I'm beastly bored,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'Let's talk about the Psammead,' said Anthea, who generally tried togive the conversation a cheerful turn."|FALSE
836|"'What's the good of TALKING?' said Cyril. 'What I want is for somethingto happen. It's awfully stuffy for a chap not to be allowed out in theevenings. There's simply nothing to do when you've got through yourhomers.'"|FALSE
836|"Jane finished the last of her home-lessons and shut the book with abang."|FALSE
836|"'We've got the pleasure of memory,' said she. 'Just think of lastholidays.'"|FALSE
836|"Last holidays, indeed, offered something to think of--for they hadbeen spent in the country at a white house between a sand-pit and agravel-pit, and things had happened. The children had found a Psammead,or sand-fairy, and it had let them have anything they wished for--justexactly anything, with no bother about its not being really for theirgood, or anything like that. And if you want to know what kind of thingsthey wished for, and how their wishes turned out you can read it all ina book called Five Children and It (It was the Psammead). If you've notread it, perhaps I ought to tell you that the fifth child was the babybrother, who was called the Lamb, because the first thing he ever saidwas 'Baa!' and that the other children were not particularly handsome,nor were they extra clever, nor extraordinarily good. But they were notbad sorts on the whole; in fact, they were rather like you."|FALSE
836|"'I don't want to think about the pleasures of memory,' said Cyril; 'Iwant some more things to happen.'"|FALSE
836|"'We're very much luckier than any one else, as it is,' said Jane. 'Why,no one else ever found a Psammead. We ought to be grateful.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why shouldn't we GO ON being, though?' Cyril asked--'lucky, I mean, notgrateful. Why's it all got to stop?'"|FALSE
836|"'Perhaps something will happen,' said Anthea, comfortably. 'Do you know,sometimes I think we are the sort of people that things DO happen to.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's like that in history,' said Jane: 'some kings are full ofinteresting things, and others--nothing ever happens to them, excepttheir being born and crowned and buried, and sometimes not that.'"|FALSE
836|"'I think Panther's right,' said Cyril: 'I think we are the sort ofpeople things do happen to. I have a sort of feeling things would happenright enough if we could only give them a shove. It just wants somethingto start it. That's all.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish they taught magic at school,' Jane sighed. 'I believe if wecould do a little magic it might make something happen.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wonder how you begin?' Robert looked round the room, but he got noideas from the faded green curtains, or the drab Venetian blinds, orthe worn brown oil-cloth on the floor. Even the new carpet suggestednothing, though its pattern was a very wonderful one, and always seemedas though it were just going to make you think of something."|FALSE
836|"'I could begin right enough,' said Anthea; 'I've read lots about it. ButI believe it's wrong in the Bible.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's only wrong in the Bible because people wanted to hurt otherpeople. I don't see how things can be wrong unless they hurt somebody,and we don't want to hurt anybody; and what's more, we jolly wellcouldn't if we tried. Let's get the Ingoldsby Legends. There's a thingabout Abra-cadabra there,' said Cyril, yawning. 'We may as well play atmagic. Let's be Knights Templars. They were awfully gone on magic. Theyused to work spells or something with a goat and a goose. Father saysso.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, that's all right,' said Robert, unkindly; 'you can play the goatright enough, and Jane knows how to be a goose.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'll get Ingoldsby,' said Anthea, hastily. 'You turn up the hearthrug.'"|FALSE
836|"So they traced strange figures on the linoleum, where the hearthrug hadkept it clean. They traced them with chalk that Robert had nickedfrom the top of the mathematical master's desk at school. You know, ofcourse, that it is stealing to take a new stick of chalk, but it is notwrong to take a broken piece, so long as you only take one. (I do notknow the reason of this rule, nor who made it.) And they chanted all thegloomiest songs they could think of. And, of course, nothing happened.So then Anthea said, 'I'm sure a magic fire ought to be made ofsweet-smelling wood, and have magic gums and essences and things in it.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't know any sweet-smelling wood, except cedar,' said Robert; 'butI've got some ends of cedar-wood lead pencil.'"|FALSE
836|"So they burned the ends of lead pencil. And still nothing happened."|FALSE
836|"'Let's burn some of the eucalyptus oil we have for our colds,' saidAnthea."|FALSE
836|"And they did. It certainly smelt very strong. And they burned lumpsof camphor out of the big chest. It was very bright, and made a horridblack smoke, which looked very magical. But still nothing happened. Thenthey got some clean tea-cloths from the dresser drawer in the kitchen,and waved them over the magic chalk-tracings, and sang 'The Hymn of theMoravian Nuns at Bethlehem', which is very impressive. And still nothinghappened. So they waved more and more wildly, and Robert's tea-clothcaught the golden egg and whisked it off the mantelpiece, and it fellinto the fender and rolled under the grate."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, crikey!' said more than one voice."|FALSE
836|"And every one instantly fell down flat on its front to look under thegrate, and there lay the egg, glowing in a nest of hot ashes."|FALSE
836|"'It's not smashed, anyhow,' said Robert, and he put his hand under thegrate and picked up the egg. But the egg was much hotter than any onewould have believed it could possibly get in such a short time, andRobert had to drop it with a cry of 'Bother!' It fell on the top bar ofthe grate, and bounced right into the glowing red-hot heart of the fire."|FALSE
836|"'The tongs!' cried Anthea. But, alas, no one could remember where theywere. Every one had forgotten that the tongs had last been used to fishup the doll's teapot from the bottom of the water-butt, where the Lambhad dropped it. So the nursery tongs were resting between the water-buttand the dustbin, and cook refused to lend the kitchen ones."|FALSE
836|"'Never mind,' said Robert, 'we'll get it out with the poker and theshovel.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, stop,' cried Anthea. 'Look at it! Look! look! look! I do believesomething IS going to happen!'"|FALSE
836|"For the egg was now red-hot, and inside it something was moving. Nextmoment there was a soft cracking sound; the egg burst in two, and out ofit came a flame-coloured bird. It rested a moment among the flames, andas it rested there the four children could see it growing bigger andbigger under their eyes."|FALSE
836|"Every mouth was a-gape, every eye a-goggle."|FALSE
836|"The bird rose in its nest of fire, stretched its wings, and flew outinto the room. It flew round and round, and round again, and where itpassed the air was warm. Then it perched on the fender. The childrenlooked at each other. Then Cyril put out a hand towards the bird. It putits head on one side and looked up at him, as you may have seen a parrotdo when it is just going to speak, so that the children were hardlyastonished at all when it said, 'Be careful; I am not nearly cool yet.'"|FALSE
836|"They were not astonished, but they were very, very much interested."|FALSE
836|"They looked at the bird, and it was certainly worth looking at. Itsfeathers were like gold. It was about as large as a bantam, only itsbeak was not at all bantam-shaped. 'I believe I know what it is,' saidRobert. 'I've seen a picture.'"|FALSE
836|"He hurried away. A hasty dash and scramble among the papers on father'sstudy table yielded, as the sum-books say, 'the desired result'. Butwhen he came back into the room holding out a paper, and crying, 'I say,look here,' the others all said 'Hush!' and he hushed obediently andinstantly, for the bird was speaking."|FALSE
836|"'Which of you,' it was saying, 'put the egg into the fire?'"|FALSE
836|"'He did,' said three voices, and three fingers pointed at Robert."|FALSE
836|"The bird bowed; at least it was more like that than anything else."|FALSE
836|"'I am your grateful debtor,' it said with a high-bred air."|FALSE
836|"The children were all choking with wonder and curiosity--all exceptRobert. He held the paper in his hand, and he KNEW. He said so. Hesaid--"|FALSE
836|"'_I_ know who you are.'"|FALSE
836|"And he opened and displayed a printed paper, at the head of which was alittle picture of a bird sitting in a nest of flames."|FALSE
836|"'You are the Phoenix,' said Robert; and the bird was quite pleased."|FALSE
836|"'My fame has lived then for two thousand years,' it said. 'Allow me tolook at my portrait.' It looked at the page which Robert, kneeling down,spread out in the fender, and said--"|FALSE
836|"'It's not a flattering likeness... And what are these characters?' itasked, pointing to the printed part."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, that's all dullish; it's not much about YOU, you know,' said Cyril,with unconscious politeness; 'but you're in lots of books.'"|FALSE
836|"'With portraits?' asked the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Well, no,' said Cyril; 'in fact, I don't think I ever saw any portraitof you but that one, but I can read you something about yourself, if youlike.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix nodded, and Cyril went off and fetched Volume X of the oldEncyclopedia, and on page 246 he found the following:--"|FALSE
836|"'Phoenix--in ornithology, a fabulous bird of antiquity.'"|FALSE
836|"'Antiquity is quite correct,' said the Phoenix, 'but fabulous--well, doI look it?'"|FALSE
836|"Every one shook its head. Cyril went on--"|FALSE
836|"'The ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of itskind.'"|FALSE
836|"'That's right enough,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'They describe it as about the size of an eagle.'"|FALSE
836|"'Eagles are of different sizes,' said the Phoenix; 'it's not at all agood description.'"|FALSE
836|"All the children were kneeling on the hearthrug, to be as near thePhoenix as possible."|FALSE
836|"'You'll boil your brains,' it said. 'Look out, I'm nearly cool now;' andwith a whirr of golden wings it fluttered from the fender to the table.It was so nearly cool that there was only a very faint smell of burningwhen it had settled itself on the table-cloth."|FALSE
836|"'It's only a very little scorched,' said the Phoenix, apologetically;'it will come out in the wash. Please go on reading.'"|FALSE
836|"The children gathered round the table."|FALSE
836|"'The size of an eagle,' Cyril went on, 'its head finely crested with abeautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, andthe rest of its body purple; only the tail white, and the eyes sparklinglike stars. They say that it lives about five hundred years in thewilderness, and when advanced in age it builds itself a pile of sweetwood and aromatic gums, fires it with the wafting of its wings, and thusburns itself; and that from its ashes arises a worm, which in time growsup to be a Phoenix. Hence the Phoenicians gave--'"|FALSE
836|"'Never mind what they gave,' said the Phoenix, ruffling its goldenfeathers. 'They never gave much, anyway; they always were people whogave nothing for nothing. That book ought to be destroyed. It'smost inaccurate. The rest of my body was never purple, and as formy--tail--well, I simply ask you, IS it white?'"|FALSE
836|"It turned round and gravely presented its golden tail to the children."|FALSE
836|"'No, it's not,' said everybody."|FALSE
836|"'No, and it never was,' said the Phoenix. 'And that about the wormis just a vulgar insult. The Phoenix has an egg, like all respectablebirds. It makes a pile--that part's all right--and it lays its egg, andit burns itself; and it goes to sleep and wakes up in its egg, and comesout and goes on living again, and so on for ever and ever. I can't tellyou how weary I got of it--such a restless existence; no repose.'"|FALSE
836|"'But how did your egg get HERE?' asked Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Ah, that's my life-secret,' said the Phoenix. 'I couldn't tell it toany one who wasn't really sympathetic. I've always been a misunderstoodbird. You can tell that by what they say about the worm. I might tellYOU,' it went on, looking at Robert with eyes that were indeed starry.'You put me on the fire--' Robert looked uncomfortable."|FALSE
836|"'The rest of us made the fire of sweet-scented woods and gums, though,'said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'And--and it was an accident my putting you on the fire,' said Robert,telling the truth with some difficulty, for he did not know how thePhoenix might take it. It took it in the most unexpected manner."|FALSE
836|"'Your candid avowal,' it said, 'removes my last scruple. I will tell youmy story.'"|FALSE
836|"'And you won't vanish, or anything sudden will you? asked Anthea,anxiously."|FALSE
836|"'Why?' it asked, puffing out the golden feathers, 'do you wish me tostay here?'"|FALSE

836|"'Why?' asked the Phoenix again, looking modestly at the table-cloth."|FALSE
836|"'Because,' said every one at once, and then stopped short; only Janeadded after a pause, 'you are the most beautiful person we've everseen.' 'You are a sensible child,' said the Phoenix, 'and I will NOTvanish or anything sudden. And I will tell you my tale. I had resided,as your book says, for many thousand years in the wilderness, which isa large, quiet place with very little really good society, and I wasbecoming weary of the monotony of my existence. But I acquired the habitof laying my egg and burning myself every five hundred years--and youknow how difficult it is to break yourself of a habit.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Cyril; 'Jane used to bite her nails.'"|FALSE
836|"'But I broke myself of it,' urged Jane, rather hurt, 'You know I did.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not till they put bitter aloes on them,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'I doubt,' said the bird, gravely, 'whether even bitter aloes (the aloe,by the way, has a bad habit of its own, which it might well cure beforeseeking to cure others; I allude to its indolent practice of floweringbut once a century), I doubt whether even bitter aloes could have curedME. But I WAS cured. I awoke one morning from a feverish dream--it wasgetting near the time for me to lay that tiresome fire and lay thattedious egg upon it--and I saw two people, a man and a woman. They weresitting on a carpet--and when I accosted them civilly they narrated tome their life-story, which, as you have not yet heard it, I will nowproceed to relate. They were a prince and princess, and the story oftheir parents was one which I am sure you will like to hear. In earlyyouth the mother of the princess happened to hear the story of a certainenchanter, and in that story I am sure you will be interested. Theenchanter--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, please don't,' said Anthea. 'I can't understand all thesebeginnings of stories, and you seem to be getting deeper and deeper inthem every minute. Do tell us your OWN story. That's what we really wantto hear.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said the Phoenix, seeming on the whole rather flattered, 'tocut about seventy long stories short (though _I_ had to listen to themall--but to be sure in the wilderness there is plenty of time), thisprince and princess were so fond of each other that they did not wantany one else, and the enchanter--don't be alarmed, I won't go intohis history--had given them a magic carpet (you've heard of a magiccarpet?), and they had just sat on it and told it to take them rightaway from every one--and it had brought them to the wilderness. And asthey meant to stay there they had no further use for the carpet, so theygave it to me. That was indeed the chance of a lifetime!'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't see what you wanted with a carpet,' said Jane, 'when you've gotthose lovely wings.'"|FALSE
836|"'They ARE nice wings, aren't they?' said the Phoenix, simpering andspreading them out. 'Well, I got the prince to lay out the carpet, and Ilaid my egg on it; then I said to the carpet, \"Now, my excellent carpet,prove your worth. Take that egg somewhere where it can't be hatched fortwo thousand years, and where, when that time's up, some one will lighta fire of sweet wood and aromatic gums, and put the egg in to hatch;\"and you see it's all come out exactly as I said. The words were nosooner out of my beak than egg and carpet disappeared. The royal loversassisted to arrange my pile, and soothed my last moments. I burnt myselfup and knew no more till I awoke on yonder altar.'"|FALSE
836|"It pointed its claw at the grate."|FALSE
836|"'But the carpet,' said Robert, 'the magic carpet that takes you anywhereyou wish. What became of that?'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, THAT?' said the Phoenix, carelessly--'I should say that that is thecarpet. I remember the pattern perfectly.'"|FALSE
836|"It pointed as it spoke to the floor, where lay the carpet which motherhad bought in the Kentish Town Road for twenty-two shillings andninepence."|FALSE
836|"At that instant father's latch-key was heard in the door."|FALSE
836|"'OH,' whispered Cyril, 'now we shall catch it for not being in bed!'"|FALSE
836|"'Wish yourself there,' said the Phoenix, in a hurried whisper, 'and thenwish the carpet back in its place.'"|FALSE
836|"No sooner said than done. It made one a little giddy, certainly, and alittle breathless; but when things seemed right way up again, there thechildren were, in bed, and the lights were out."|FALSE

836|"'I shall sleep on the cornice above your curtains,' it said. 'Pleasedon't mention me to your kinsfolk.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not much good,' said Robert, 'they'd never believe us. I say,' hecalled through the half-open door to the girls; 'talk about adventuresand things happening. We ought to be able to get some fun out of a magiccarpet AND a Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"'Rather,' said the girls, in bed."|FALSE
836|"'Children,' said father, on the stairs, 'go to sleep at once. What doyou mean by talking at this time of night?'"|FALSE
836|"No answer was expected to this question, but under the bedclothes Cyrilmurmured one."|FALSE

836|"The children had seen the Phoenix-egg hatched in the flames in their ownnursery grate, and had heard from it how the carpet on their own nurseryfloor was really the wishing carpet, which would take them anywhere theychose. The carpet had transported them to bed just at the rightmoment, and the Phoenix had gone to roost on the cornice supporting thewindow-curtains of the boys' room."|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said a gentle voice, and a courteous beak opened, verykindly and delicately, the right eye of Cyril. 'I hear the slaves belowpreparing food. Awaken! A word of explanation and arrangement... I dowish you wouldn't--'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to thecornice-pole; for Cyril had hit out, as boys do when they are awakenedsuddenly, and the Phoenix was not used to boys, and his feelings, if nothis wings, were hurt."|FALSE

836|"The Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the bed."|FALSE
836|"'I say--you ARE real,' said Cyril. 'How ripping! And the carpet?'"|FALSE

836|"'Yes, indeed,' said Cyril, 'I see it is. Oh, what luck! Wake up, Bobs!There's jolly well something to wake up for today. And it's Saturday,too.'"|FALSE
836|"'I've been reflecting,' said the Phoenix, 'during the silent watchesof the night, and I could not avoid the conclusion that you were quiteinsufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday. The ancients werealways VERY surprised. Did you, by chance, EXPECT my egg to hatch?'"|FALSE
836|"'Not us,' Cyril said."|FALSE
836|"'And if we had,' said Anthea, who had come in in her nightie when sheheard the silvery voice of the Phoenix, 'we could never, never haveexpected it to hatch anything so splendid as you.'"|FALSE
836|"The bird smiled. Perhaps you've never seen a bird smile?"|FALSE
836|"'You see,' said Anthea, wrapping herself in the boys' counterpane, forthe morning was chill, 'we've had things happen to us before;' and shetold the story of the Psammead, or sand-fairy."|FALSE
836|"'Ah yes,' said the Phoenix; 'Psammeads were rare, even in my time. Iremember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert. I was alwayshaving compliments paid me; I can't think why.'"|FALSE
836|"'Can YOU give wishes, then?' asked Jane, who had now come in too."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, dear me, no,' said the Phoenix, contemptuously, 'at least--but Ihear footsteps approaching. I hasten to conceal myself.' And it did."|FALSE
836|"I think I said that this day was Saturday. It was also cook's birthday,and mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal Palace with aparty of friends, so Jane and Anthea of course had to help to make bedsand to wash up the breakfast cups, and little things like that. Robertand Cyril intended to spend the morning in conversation with thePhoenix, but the bird had its own ideas about this."|FALSE
836|"'I must have an hour or two's quiet,' it said, 'I really must. My nerveswill give way unless I can get a little rest. You must remember it's twothousand years since I had any conversation--I'm out of practice, and Imust take care of myself. I've often been told that mine is a valuablelife.' So it nestled down inside an old hatbox of father's, which hadbeen brought down from the box-room some days before, when a helmet wassuddenly needed for a game of tournaments, with its golden head underits golden wing, and went to sleep. So then Robert and Cyril movedthe table back and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselvessomewhere else. But before they could decide on the place, Cyril said--"|FALSE
836|"'I don't know. Perhaps it's rather sneakish to begin without the girls.'"|FALSE
836|"'They'll be all the morning,' said Robert, impatiently. And then a thinginside him, which tiresome books sometimes call the 'inward monitor',said, 'Why don't you help them, then?'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril's 'inward monitor' happened to say the same thing at the samemoment, so the boys went and helped to wash up the tea-cups, and to dustthe drawing-room. Robert was so interested that he proposed to cleanthe front doorsteps--a thing he had never been allowed to do. Nor washe allowed to do it on this occasion. One reason was that it had alreadybeen done by cook."|FALSE
836|"When all the housework was finished, the girls dressed the happy,wriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and three-cornered hat, andkept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to takehim over to granny's. Mother always went to granny's every Saturday,and generally some of the children went with her; but today they were tokeep house.

836|"You can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time if youplay the Noah's Ark game with him. It is quite simple. He just sits onyour lap and tells you what animal he is, and then you say the littlepoetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be."|FALSE
836|"Of course, some of the animals, like the zebra and the tiger, haven'tgot any poetry, because they are so difficult to rhyme to. The Lambknows quite well which are the poetry animals."|FALSE

836|"By the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel, and a babyrabbit and a baby rat, mother was ready; and she and the Lamb, havingbeen kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is possible tobe when you're dressed for out-of-doors, were seen to the tram by theboys. When the boys came back, every one looked at every one else andsaid--"|FALSE
836|"'Now!'"|FALSE
836|"They locked the front door and they locked the back door, and theyfastened all the windows. They moved the table and chairs off thecarpet, and Anthea swept it."|FALSE
836|"'We must show it a LITTLE attention,' she said kindly. 'We'll give ittea-leaves next time. Carpets like tea-leaves.'"|FALSE
836|"Then every one put on its out-door things, because as Cyril said, theydidn't know where they might be going, and it makes people stare if yougo out of doors in November in pinafores and without hats."|FALSE
836|"Then Robert gently awoke the Phoenix, who yawned and stretched itself,and allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the carpet, where itinstantly went to sleep again with its crested head tucked under itsgolden wing as before. Then every one sat down on the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Where shall we go?' was of course the question, and it was warmlydiscussed. Anthea wanted to go to Japan. Robert and Cyril voted forAmerica, and Jane wished to go to the seaside."|FALSE
836|"'Because there are donkeys there,' said she."|FALSE
836|"'Not in November, silly,' said Cyril; and the discussion got warmer andwarmer, and still nothing was settled."|FALSE
836|"'I vote we let the Phoenix decide,' said Robert, at last. So theystroked it till it woke. 'We want to go somewhere abroad,' they said,'and we can't make up our minds where.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let the carpet make up ITS mind, if it has one,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Just say you wish to go abroad.'"|FALSE
836|"So they did; and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside down,and when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy enough to lookabout them, they were out of doors."|FALSE
836|"Out of doors--this is a feeble way to express where they were. Theywere out of--out of the earth, or off it. In fact, they were floatingsteadily, safely, splendidly, in the crisp clear air, with the palebright blue of the sky above them, and far down below the pale brightsun-diamonded waves of the sea. The carpet had stiffened itself somehow,so that it was square and firm like a raft, and it steered itself sobeautifully and kept on its way so flat and fearless that no one was atall afraid of tumbling off. In front of them lay land."|FALSE

836|"'It's like trains,' said Anthea, as they swept over the low-lyingcoast-line and held a steady course above orderly fields and straightroads bordered with poplar trees--'like express trains, only in trainsyou never can see anything because of grown-ups wanting the windowsshut; and then they breathe on them, and it's like ground glass, andnobody can see anything, and then they go to sleep.'"|FALSE

836|"Every one looked and every one thought. And the glorious, gliding,smooth, steady rush went on, and they looked down on strange andbeautiful things, and held their breath and let it go in deep sighs, andsaid 'Oh!' and 'Ah!' till it was long past dinner-time."|FALSE
836|"It was Jane who suddenly said, 'I wish we'd brought that jam tart andcold mutton with us. It would have been jolly to have a picnic in theair.'"|FALSE
836|"The jam tart and cold mutton were, however, far away, sitting quietly inthe larder of the house in Camden Town which the children were supposedto be keeping. A mouse was at that moment tasting the outside of theraspberry jam part of the tart (she had nibbled a sort of gulf, or bay,through the pastry edge) to see whether it was the sort of dinner shecould ask her little mouse-husband to sit down to. She had had a verygood dinner herself. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good."|FALSE
836|"'We'll stop as soon as we see a nice place,' said Anthea. 'I've gotthreepence, and you boys have the fourpence each that your trams didn'tcost the other day, so we can buy things to eat. I expect the Phoenixcan speak French.'"|FALSE
836|"The carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and townsand farms and fields. It reminded everybody of a certain time when allof them had had wings, and had flown up to the top of a church tower,and had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and new bread andsoda-water. And this again reminded them how hungry they were. And justas they were all being reminded of this very strongly indeed, they sawahead of them some ruined walls on a hill, and strong and upright, andreally, to look at, as good as new--a great square tower."|FALSE
836|"'The top of that's just the exactly same size as the carpet,' said Jane.'_I_ think it would be good to go to the top of that, because then noneof the Abby-what's-its-names--I mean natives--would be able to take thecarpet away even if they wanted to. And some of us could go out and getthings to eat--buy them honestly, I mean, not take them out of larderwindows.'"|FALSE

836|"The carpet made a disconcerting bound, and next moment it was hoveringabove the square top of the tower. Then slowly and carefully it began tosink under them. It was like a lift going down with you at the Army andNavy Stores."|FALSE
836|"'I don't think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to themfirst,' said Robert, huffishly. 'Hullo! What on earth?'"|FALSE
836|"For unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the foursides of the carpet. It was as if a wall were being built by magicquickness. It was a foot high--it was two feet high--three, four, five.It was shutting out the light--more and more."|FALSE
836|"Anthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet abovethem."|FALSE

836|"Robert sprang to his feet."|FALSE
836|"'We ought to have--Hullo! an owl's nest.' He put his knee on a juttingsmooth piece of grey stone, and reached his hand into a deep windowslit--broad to the inside of the tower, and narrowing like a funnel tothe outside."|FALSE

836|"But Robert couldn't turn round all in a minute into a jumping position.He wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge, and by the timehe was ready to jump the walls of the tower had risen up thirty feetabove the others, who were still sinking with the carpet, and Robertfound himself in the embrasure of a window; alone, for even the owlswere not at home that day. The wall was smoothish; there was no climbingup, and as for climbing down--Robert hid his face in his hands, andsquirmed back and back from the giddy verge, until the back part of himwas wedged quite tight in the narrowest part of the window slit."|FALSE
836|"He was safe now, of course, but the outside part of his window was likea frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower. It was verypretty, with moss growing between the stones and little shiny gems; butbetween him and it there was the width of the tower, and nothing in itbut empty air. The situation was terrible. Robert saw in a flash thatthe carpet was likely to bring them into just the same sort of tightplaces that they used to get into with the wishes the Psammead grantedthem."|FALSE
836|"And the others--imagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly andsteadily to the very bottom of the tower, leaving Robert clinging to thewall. Robert did not even try to imagine their feelings--he had quiteenough to do with his own; but you can."|FALSE
836|"As soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of theinside of the tower it suddenly lost that raft-like stiffness which hadbeen such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town to the toplesstower, and spread itself limply over the loose stones and little earthymounds at the bottom of the tower, just exactly like any ordinarycarpet. Also it shrank suddenly, so that it seemed to draw away fromunder their feet, and they stepped quickly off the edges and stood onthe firm ground, while the carpet drew itself in till it was its propersize, and no longer fitted exactly into the inside of the tower, butleft quite a big space all round it."|FALSE
836|"Then across the carpet they looked at each other, and then every chinwas tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor Robert hadgot to. Of course, they couldn't see him."|FALSE

836|"'You always do,' said Cyril, briefly. 'Look here, we can't leave Robertup there. I wish the carpet would fetch him down.'"|FALSE
836|"The carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together. Itstiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls of thetower. The children below craned their heads back, and nearly broketheir necks in doing it. The carpet rose and rose. It hung poised darklyabove them for an anxious moment or two; then it dropped down again,threw itself on the uneven floor of the tower, and as it did so ittumbled Robert out on the uneven floor of the tower."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, glory!' said Robert, 'that was a squeak. You don't know how I felt.I say, I've had about enough for a bit. Let's wish ourselves at homeagain and have a go at that jam tart and mutton. We can go out againafterwards.'"|FALSE
836|"'Righto!' said every one, for the adventure had shaken the nerves ofall. So they all got on to the carpet again, and said--"|FALSE

836|"'You did tell us WHAT?' interrupted an Exasperated."|FALSE
836|"'Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU'VE HADTHEM.'"|FALSE

836|"It was not a pleasant thought, and though Anthea at once said, 'Ofcourse it will come back; I'm certain it's a bird of its word,' afurther gloom was cast by the idea. For, curiously enough, there wasno door to the tower, and all the windows were far, far too high to bereached by the most adventurous climber. It was cold, too, and Antheashivered."|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Cyril, 'it's like being at the bottom of a well.'"|FALSE
836|"The children waited in a sad and hungry silence, and got little stiffnecks with holding their little heads back to look up the inside of thetall grey tower, to see if the Phoenix were coming."|FALSE
836|"At last it came. It looked very big as it fluttered down between thewalls, and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness wascaused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one claw.In the other it held a piece of bread. And in its beak was a very largepear. The pear was juicy, and as good as a very small drink. When themeal was over every one felt better, and the question of how to get homewas discussed without any disagreeableness. But no one could thinkof any way out of the difficulty, or even out of the tower; for thePhoenix, though its beak and claws had fortunately been strong enoughto carry food for them, was plainly not equal to flying through the airwith four well-nourished children."|FALSE
836|"'We must stay here, I suppose,' said Robert at last, 'and shout outevery now and then, and some one will hear us and bring ropes andladders, and rescue us like out of mines; and they'll get up asubscription to send us home, like castaways.'"|FALSE

836|"'I CAN help you,' it said. 'I am almost sure I can help you. Unless Iam grossly deceived I can help you. You won't mind my leaving you for anhour or two?' and without waiting for a reply it soared up through thedimness of the tower into the brightness above."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' said Cyril, firmly, 'it said an hour or two. But I've readabout captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and thingsawaiting release, and I know each moment is an eternity. Those peoplealways do something to pass the desperate moments. It's no use ourtrying to tame spiders, because we shan't have time.'"|FALSE
836|"'I HOPE not,' said Jane, doubtfully."|FALSE
836|"'But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something.'"|FALSE
836|"'I say, talking of stones,' said Robert, 'you see that heap of stonesagainst the wall over in that corner. Well, I'm certain there's a holein the wall there--and I believe it's a door. Yes, look here--the stonesare round like an arch in the wall; and here's the hole--it's all blackinside.'"|FALSE
836|"He had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up toit--dislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little darkspace."|FALSE
836|"Next moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones, andvery soon every one threw off its jacket, for it was warm work."|FALSE
836|"'It IS a door,' said Cyril, wiping his face, 'and not a bad thingeither, if--'"|FALSE
836|"He was going to add 'if anything happens to the Phoenix,' but he didn'tfor fear of frightening Jane. He was not an unkind boy when he hadleisure to think of such things."|FALSE
836|"The arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger. It was very, veryblack, even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom of thetower; it grew larger because the children kept pulling off the stonesand throwing them down into another heap. The stones must have beenthere a very long time, for they were covered with moss, and some ofthem were stuck together by it. So it was fairly hard work, as Robertpointed out."|FALSE
836|"When the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the archand the tower, Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on theinside, and lit matches. How thankful they felt then that they had asensible father, who did not forbid them to carry matches, as some boys'fathers do. The father of Robert and Cyril only insisted on the matchesbeing of the kind that strike only on the box."|FALSE
836|"'It's not a door, it's a sort of tunnel,' Robert cried to the girls,after the first match had flared up, flickered, and gone out. 'Standoff--we'll push some more stones down!'"|FALSE
836|"They did, amid deep excitement. And now the stone heap was almostgone--and before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to unknownthings. All doubts and fears as to getting home were forgotten in thisthrilling moment. It was like Monte Cristo--it was like--"|FALSE
836|"'I say,' cried Anthea, suddenly, 'come out! There's always bad air inplaces that have been shut up. It makes your torches go out, and thenyou die. It's called fire-damp, I believe. Come out, I tell you.'"|FALSE
836|"The urgency of her tone actually brought the boys out--and then everyone took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it, so as tomake the air fresh inside. When Anthea thought the air inside 'must befreshened by now,' Cyril led the way into the arch."|FALSE
836|"The girls followed, and Robert came last, because Jane refused to tailthe procession lest 'something' should come in after her, and catch ather from behind. Cyril advanced cautiously, lighting match after match,and peering before him."|FALSE
836|"'It's a vaulting roof,' he said, 'and it's all stone--all right,Panther, don't keep pulling at my jacket! The air must be all rightbecause of the matches, silly, and there are--look out--there are stepsdown.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, don't let's go any farther,' said Jane, in an agony of reluctance(a very painful thing, by the way, to be in). 'I'm sure there aresnakes, or dens of lions, or something. Do let's go back, and come someother time, with candles, and bellows for the fire-damp.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let me get in front of you, then,' said the stern voice of Robert, frombehind. 'This is exactly the place for buried treasure, and I'm goingon, anyway; you can stay behind if you like.'"|FALSE
836|"And then, of course, Jane consented to go on."|FALSE
836|"So, very slowly and carefully, the children went down the steps--therewere seventeen of them--and at the bottom of the steps were morepassages branching four ways, and a sort of low arch on the right-handside made Cyril wonder what it could be, for it was too low to be thebeginning of another passage."|FALSE
836|"So he knelt down and lit a match, and stooping very low he peeped in."|FALSE
836|"'There's SOMETHING,' he said, and reached out his hand. It touchedsomething that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything elsethat Cyril had ever touched."|FALSE
836|"'I believe it IS a buried treasure,' he cried."|FALSE
836|"And it was; for even as Anthea cried, 'Oh, hurry up, Squirrel--fetch itout!' Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas bag--about as big as the paperones the greengrocer gives you with Barcelona nuts in for sixpence."|FALSE
836|"'There's more of it, a lot more,' he said."|FALSE
836|"As he pulled the rotten bag gave way, and the gold coins ran and spanand jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of the darkpassage."|FALSE
836|"I wonder what you would say if you suddenly came upon a buried treasure?What Cyril said was, 'Oh, bother--I've burnt my fingers!' and as hespoke he dropped the match. 'AND IT WAS THE LAST!' he added."|FALSE
836|"There was a moment of desperate silence. Then Jane began to cry."|FALSE
836|"'Don't,' said Anthea, 'don't, Pussy--you'll exhaust the air if you cry.We can get out all right.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Jane, through her sobs, 'and find the Phoenix has come backand gone away again--because it thought we'd gone home some other way,and--Oh, I WISH we hadn't come.'"|FALSE
836|"Every one stood quite still--only Anthea cuddled Jane up to her andtried to wipe her eyes in the dark."|FALSE
836|"'D-DON'T,' said Jane; 'that's my EAR--I'm not crying with my ears.'"|FALSE
836|"'Come, let's get on out,' said Robert; but that was not so easy, for noone could remember exactly which way they had come. It is very difficultto remember things in the dark, unless you have matches with you, andthen of course it is quite different, even if you don't strike one."|FALSE
836|"Every one had come to agree with Jane's constant wish--and despair wasmaking the darkness blacker than ever, when quite suddenly the floorseemed to tip up--and a strong sensation of being in a whirling liftcame upon every one. All eyes were closed--one's eyes always are in thedark, don't you think? When the whirling feeling stopped, Cyril said'Earthquakes!' and they all opened their eyes."|FALSE
836|"They were in their own dingy breakfast-room at home, and oh, how lightand bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it seemedafter that dark underground tunnel! The carpet lay on the floor, lookingas calm as though it had never been for an excursion in its life. Onthe mantelpiece stood the Phoenix, waiting with an air of modest yetsterling worth for the thanks of the children."|FALSE
836|"'But how DID you do it?' they asked, when every one had thanked thePhoenix again and again."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead.'"|FALSE
836|"'But how DID you know where to find it?'"|FALSE
836|"'I found that out from the carpet; these wishing creatures always knowall about each other--they're so clannish; like the Scots, you know--allrelated.'"|FALSE
836|"'But, the carpet can't talk, can it?'"|FALSE
836|"'No.'"|FALSE
836|"'Then how--'"|FALSE
836|"'How did I get the Psammead's address? I tell you I got it from thecarpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'DID it speak then?'"|FALSE
836|"'No,' said the Phoenix, thoughtfully, 'it didn't speak, but I gatheredmy information from something in its manner. I was always a singularlyobservant bird.'"|FALSE
836|"It was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart, as well as thetea and bread-and-butter, that any one found time to regret the goldentreasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the undergroundpassage, and which, indeed, no one had thought of till now, since themoment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of the last match."|FALSE
836|"'What owls and goats we were!' said Robert. 'Look how we've alwayswanted treasure--and now--'"|FALSE
836|"'Never mind,' said Anthea, trying as usual to make the best of it.'We'll go back again and get it all, and then we'll give everybodypresents.'"|FALSE
836|"More than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging whatpresents should be given to whom, and, when the claims of generosity hadbeen satisfied, the talk ran for fifty minutes on what they would buyfor themselves."|FALSE
836|"It was Cyril who broke in on Robert's almost too technical account ofthe motor-car on which he meant to go to and from school--"|FALSE
836|"'There!' he said. 'Dry up. It's no good. We can't ever go back. We don'tknow where it is.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't YOU know?' Jane asked the Phoenix, wistfully."|FALSE
836|"'Not in the least,' the Phoenix replied, in a tone of amiable regret."|FALSE
836|"'Then we've lost the treasure,' said Cyril. And they had."|FALSE
836|"'But we've got the carpet and the Phoenix,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said the bird, with an air of wounded dignity, 'I do SOHATE to seem to interfere, but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix and thecarpet?'"|FALSE
836|"CHAPTER 3. THE QUEEN COOK"|FALSE
836|"It was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious journeyon the wishing carpet. Unless you are too young to read at all, you willknow that the next day must have been Sunday."|FALSE
836|"Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, was always a very prettyday. Father always brought home flowers on Saturday, so that thebreakfast-table was extra beautiful. In November, of course, the flowerswere chrysanthemums, yellow and coppery coloured. Then there were alwayssausages on toast for breakfast, and these are rapture, after six daysof Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a shilling."|FALSE
836|"On this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner, a kind of foodthat is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions, and therewas an angel pudding, when rice and milk and oranges and white icing dotheir best to make you happy."|FALSE
836|"After dinner father was very sleepy indeed, because he had been workinghard all the week; but he did not yield to the voice that said, 'Go andhave an hour's rest.' He nursed the Lamb, who had a horrid cough thatcook said was whooping-cough as sure as eggs, and he said--"|FALSE
836|"'Come along, kiddies; I've got a ripping book from the library, calledThe Golden Age, and I'll read it to you.'"|FALSE
836|"Mother settled herself on the drawing-room sofa, and said she couldlisten quite nicely with her eyes shut. The Lamb snugged into the'armchair corner' of daddy's arm, and the others got into a happy heapon the hearth-rug. At first, of course, there were too many feet andknees and shoulders and elbows, but real comfort was actually settlingdown on them, and the Phoenix and the carpet were put away on the backtop shelf of their minds (beautiful things that could be taken out andplayed with later), when a surly solid knock came at the drawing-roomdoor. It opened an angry inch, and the cook's voice said, 'Please, m',may I speak to you a moment?'"|FALSE
836|"Mother looked at father with a desperate expression. Then she put herpretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa, and stood up in them andsighed."|FALSE
836|"'As good fish in the sea,' said father, cheerfully, and it was not tillmuch later that the children understood what he meant."|FALSE
836|"Mother went out into the passage, which is called 'the hall', where theumbrella-stand is, and the picture of the 'Monarch of the Glen' in ayellow shining frame, with brown spots on the Monarch from the dampin the house before last, and there was cook, very red and damp in theface, and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over the dirty one thatshe had dished up those dear delightful chickens in. She stood there andshe seemed to get redder and damper, and she twisted the corner of herapron round her fingers, and she said very shortly and fiercely--"|FALSE
836|"'If you please ma'am, I should wish to leave at my day month.' Motherleaned against the hatstand. The children could see her looking palethrough the crack of the door, because she had been very kind to thecook, and had given her a holiday only the day before, and it seemed sovery unkind of the cook to want to go like this, and on a Sunday too."|FALSE
836|"'Why, what's the matter?' mother said."|FALSE
836|"'It's them children,' the cook replied, and somehow the children allfelt that they had known it from the first. They did not remember havingdone anything extra wrong, but it is so frightfully easy to displease acook. 'It's them children: there's that there new carpet in their room,covered thick with mud, both sides, beastly yellow mud, and sakes aliveknows where they got it. And all that muck to clean up on a Sunday! It'snot my place, and it's not my intentions, so I don't deceive you, ma'am,and but for them limbs, which they is if ever there was, it's not a badplace, though I says it, and I wouldn't wish to leave, but--'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm very sorry,' said mother, gently. 'I will speak to the children.And you had better think it over, and if you REALLY wish to go, tell meto-morrow.'"|FALSE
836|"Next day mother had a quiet talk with cook, and cook said she didn'tmind if she stayed on a bit, just to see."|FALSE
836|"But meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone intothoroughly by father and mother. Jane's candid explanation that themud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was buriedtreasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the otherslimited their defence to an expression of sorrow, and of a determination'not to do it again'. But father said (and mother agreed with him,because mothers have to agree with fathers, and not because it was herown idea) that children who coated a carpet on both sides with thickmud, and when they were asked for an explanation could only talk sillynonsense--that meant Jane's truthful statement--were not fit to have acarpet at all, and, indeed, SHOULDN'T have one for a week!"|FALSE
836|"So the carpet was brushed (with tea-leaves, too) which was the onlycomfort Anthea could think of, and folded up and put away in thecupboard at the top of the stairs, and daddy put the key in his trouserspocket. 'Till Saturday,' said he."|FALSE
836|"'Never mind,' said Anthea, 'we've got the Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"But, as it happened, they hadn't. The Phoenix was nowhere to be found,and everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild beauty ofmagic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary November lifein Camden Town--and there was the nursery floor all bare boards inthe middle and brown oilcloth round the outside, and the bareness andyellowness of the middle floor showed up the blackbeetles with terribledistinctness, when the poor things came out in the evening, as usual, totry to make friends with the children. But the children never would."|FALSE
836|"The Sunday ended in gloom, which even junket for supper in the blueDresden bowl could hardly lighten at all. Next day the Lamb's coughwas worse. It certainly seemed very whoopy, and the doctor came in hisbrougham carriage."|FALSE
836|"Every one tried to bear up under the weight of the sorrow which it wasto know that the wishing carpet was locked up and the Phoenix mislaid. Agood deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'It's a bird of its word,' said Anthea. 'I'm sure it's not deserted us.But you know it had a most awfully long fly from wherever it was to nearRochester and back, and I expect the poor thing's feeling tired out andwants rest. I am sure we may trust it.'"|FALSE
836|"The others tried to feel sure of this, too, but it was hard."|FALSE
836|"No one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook, since itwas entirely through her making such a fuss about a little foreign mudthat the carpet had been taken away."|FALSE
836|"'She might have told us,' said Jane, 'and Panther and I would havecleaned it with tea-leaves.'"|FALSE
836|"'She's a cantankerous cat,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'I shan't say what I think about her,' said Anthea, primly, 'because itwould be evil speaking, lying, and slandering.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not lying to say she's a disagreeable pig, and a beastlyblue-nosed Bozwoz,' said Cyril, who had read The Eyes of Light, andintended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk likePaul."|FALSE
836|"And all the children, even Anthea, agreed that even if she wasn't ablue-nosed Bozwoz, they wished cook had never been born."|FALSE
836|"But I ask you to believe that they didn't do all the things on purposewhich so annoyed the cook during the following week, though I daresaythe things would not have happened if the cook had been a favourite.This is a mystery. Explain it if you can. The things that had happenedwere as follows:"|FALSE
836|"Sunday.--Discovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet."|FALSE
836|"Monday.--Liquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan.Anthea did this, because she thought it would be good for the Lamb'scough. The whole thing forgotten, and bottom of saucepan burned out. Itwas the little saucepan lined with white that was kept for the baby'smilk."|FALSE
836|"Tuesday.--A dead mouse found in pantry. Fish-slice taken to dig gravewith. By regrettable accident fish-slice broken. Defence: 'The cookoughtn't to keep dead mice in pantries.'"|FALSE
836|"Wednesday.--Chopped suet left on kitchen table. Robert added choppedsoap, but he says he thought the suet was soap too."|FALSE
836|"Thursday.--Broke the kitchen window by falling against it during aperfectly fair game of bandits in the area."|FALSE
836|"Friday.--Stopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled sinkwith water to make a lake to sail paper boats in. Went away and left thetap running. Kitchen hearthrug and cook's shoes ruined."|FALSE
836|"On Saturday the carpet was restored. There had been plenty of timeduring the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they didget it back."|FALSE
836|"Mother had gone over to granny's, and had not taken the Lamb because hehad a bad cough, which, cook repeatedly said, was whooping-cough as sureas eggs is eggs."|FALSE
836|"'But we'll take him out, a ducky darling,' said Anthea. 'We'll takehim somewhere where you can't have whooping-cough. Don't be so silly,Robert. If he DOES talk about it no one'll take any notice. He's alwaystalking about things he's never seen.'"|FALSE
836|"So they dressed the Lamb and themselves in out-of-doors clothes, and theLamb chuckled and coughed, and laughed and coughed again, poor dear, andall the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet by the boys, whileJane nursed the Lamb, and Anthea rushed through the house in one lastwild hunt for the missing Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'It's no use waiting for it,' she said, reappearing breathless in thebreakfast-room. 'But I know it hasn't deserted us. It's a bird of itsword.'"|FALSE
836|"'Quite so,' said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the table."|FALSE
836|"Every one fell on its knees and looked up, and there was the Phoenixperched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the table, and hadonce supported a drawer, in the happy days before the drawer had beenused as a boat, and its bottom unfortunately trodden out by Raggett'sReally Reliable School Boots on the feet of Robert."|FALSE
836|"'I've been here all the time,' said the Phoenix, yawning politelybehind its claw. 'If you wanted me you should have recited the ode ofinvocation; it's seven thousand lines long, and written in very pure andbeautiful Greek.'"|FALSE
836|"'Couldn't you tell it us in English?' asked Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'It's rather long, isn't it?' said Jane, jumping the Lamb on her knee."|FALSE

836|"'Oh, come along, do,' said Robert, holding out his hand. 'Come along,good old Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix,' it corrected shyly."|FALSE

836|"The Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist."|FALSE
836|"'This amiable youth,' it said to the others, 'has miraculously been ableto put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek invocationinto one English hexameter--a little misplaced some of the words--but--"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, come along, come along, good old beautiful Phoenix!'"|FALSE
836|"'Not perfect, I admit--but not bad for a boy of his age.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, now then,' said Robert, stepping back on to the carpet with thegolden Phoenix on his wrist."|FALSE
836|"'You look like the king's falconer,' said Jane, sitting down on thecarpet with the baby on her lap."|FALSE
836|"Robert tried to go on looking like it. Cyril and Anthea stood on thecarpet."|FALSE
836|"'We shall have to get back before dinner,' said Cyril, 'or cook willblow the gaff.'"|FALSE
836|"'She hasn't sneaked since Sunday,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'She--' Robert was beginning, when the door burst open and the cook,fierce and furious, came in like a whirlwind and stood on the corner ofthe carpet, with a broken basin in one hand and a threat in the other,which was clenched."|FALSE
836|"'Look 'ere!' she cried, 'my only basin; and what the powers am I tomake the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for yourdinners? You don't deserve no dinners, so yer don't.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm awfully sorry, cook,' said Anthea gently; 'it was my fault, andI forgot to tell you about it. It got broken when we were telling ourfortunes with melted lead, you know, and I meant to tell you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Meant to tell me,' replied the cook; she was red with anger, and reallyI don't wonder--'meant to tell! Well, _I_ mean to tell, too. I've heldmy tongue this week through, because the missus she said to me quietlike, \"We mustn't expect old heads on young shoulders,\" but now I shan'thold it no longer. There was the soap you put in our pudding, and me andEliza never so much as breathed it to your ma--though well we might--andthe saucepan, and the fish-slice, and--My gracious cats alive! what 'aveyou got that blessed child dressed up in his outdoors for?'"|FALSE
836|"'We aren't going to take him out,' said Anthea; 'at least--' She stoppedshort, for though they weren't going to take him out in the KentishTown Road, they certainly intended to take him elsewhere. But not at allwhere cook meant when she said 'out'. This confused the truthful Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Out!' said the cook, 'that I'll take care you don't;' and she snatchedthe Lamb from the lap of Jane, while Anthea and Robert caught her by theskirts and apron. 'Look here,' said Cyril, in stern desperation, 'willyou go away, and make your pudding in a pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or ahot-water can, or something?'"|FALSE
836|"'Not me,' said the cook, briefly; 'and leave this precious poppet foryou to give his deathercold to.'"|FALSE

836|"'Late yourself the little popsey-wopsey,' said the cook, with angrytenderness. 'They shan't take it out, no more they shan't. And--Wheredid you get that there yellow fowl?' She pointed to the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"Even Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss wouldbe theirs."|FALSE
836|"'I wish,' she said suddenly, 'we were on a sunny southern shore, wherethere can't be any whooping-cough.'"|FALSE
836|"She said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb, and the sturdyscoldings of the cook, and instantly the giddy-go-round-and-falling-liftfeeling swept over the whole party, and the cook sat down flat on thecarpet, holding the screaming Lamb tight to her stout print-coveredself, and calling on St Bridget to help her. She was an Irishwoman."|FALSE
836|"The moment the tipsy-topsy-turvy feeling stopped, the cook opened hereyes, gave one sounding screech and shut them again, and Anthea took theopportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her own arms."|FALSE

836|"It certainly was; for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on asouthern shore that was sunny and no mistake, as Robert remarked. Thegreenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where palm-trees andall the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of in Westward Ho! andFair Play were growing in rich profusion. Between the green, green slopeand the blue, blue sea lay a stretch of sand that looked like a carpetof jewelled cloth of gold, for it was not greyish as our northern sandis, but yellow and changing--opal-coloured like sunshine and rainbows.And at the very moment when the wild, whirling, blinding, deafening,tumbling upside-downness of the carpet-moving stopped, the children hadthe happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the edgeof the sea and disappear in the water. And it was hotter than you canpossibly imagine, unless you think of ovens on a baking-day."|FALSE
836|"Every one without an instant's hesitation tore off itsLondon-in-November outdoor clothes, and Anthea took off the Lamb'shighwayman blue coat and his three-cornered hat, and then his jersey,and then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his little blue tightbreeches and stood up happy and hot in his little white shirt."|FALSE

836|"'Ho yes!' said the cook; 'they always says that in dreams.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's REAL, I tell you,' Robert said, stamping his foot. 'I'm not goingto tell you how it's done, because that's our secret.' He winked heavilyat each of the others in turn. 'But you wouldn't go away and make thatpudding, so we HAD to bring you, and I hope you like it.'"|FALSE
836|"'I do that, and no mistake,' said the cook unexpectedly; 'and it being adream it don't matter what I say; and I WILL say, if it's my last word,that of all the aggravating little varmints--' 'Calm yourself, my goodwoman,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Good woman, indeed,' said the cook; 'good woman yourself' Then shesaw who it was that had spoken. 'Well, if I ever,' said she; 'this issomething like a dream! Yellow fowls a-talking and all! I've heard ofsuch, but never did I think to see the day.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, then,' said Cyril, impatiently, 'sit here and see the day now.It's a jolly fine day. Here, you others--a council!' They walked alongthe shore till they were out of earshot of the cook, who still satgazing about her with a happy, dreamy, vacant smile."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Cyril, 'we must roll the carpet up and hide it, sothat we can get at it at any moment. The Lamb can be getting rid ofhis whooping-cough all the morning, and we can look about; and if thesavages on this island are cannibals, we'll hook it, and take her back.And if not, we'll LEAVE HER HERE.'"|FALSE

He had hardly anyclothes, and his body all over was a dark and beautiful copperycolour--just like the chrysanthemums father had brought home onSaturday. In his hand he held a spear. The whites of his eyes and thewhite of his teeth were the only light things about him, except thatwhere the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white, too. Ifyou will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet with next tonothing on, you will see at once--if the sun happens to be shining atthe time--that I am right about this."|FALSE
836|"The savage looked at the children. Concealment was impossible.

There wasno time for discussion, and no one wanted to discuss anything, anyhow.Whether these coppery people were cannibals or not now seemed to mattervery little."|FALSE
836|"Without an instant's hesitation the four children turned and ran backalong the forest path; the only pause was Anthea's.

836|"'Gee-up, Squirrel; gee-gee,' he shouted, and Cyril did gee-up. The pathwas a shorter cut to the beach than the creeper-covered way by whichthey had come, and almost directly they saw through the trees theshining blue-and-gold-and-opal of sand and sea."|FALSE

836|"Their feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his breathlesswords were ended. The calm baby-waves were easy to go through.

836|"'How can you understand what they say?' asked Cyril, doubtfully."|FALSE
836|"'It's as easy as kissing your claw,' replied the bird. 'I speak andunderstand ALL languages, even that of your cook, which is difficult andunpleasing. It's quite easy, when you know how it's done. It just comesto you. I should advise you to beach the carpet and land the cargo--thecook, I mean. You can take my word for it, the copper-coloured ones willnot harm you now.'"|FALSE
836|"It is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells youto. So the children at once got hold of the corners of the carpet,and, pulling it from under the cook, towed it slowly in through theshallowing water, and at last spread it on the sand. The cook, who hadfollowed, instantly sat down on it, and at once the copper-colourednatives, now strangely humble, formed a ring round the carpet, and fellon their faces on the rainbow-and-gold sand. The tallest savage spokein this position, which must have been very awkward for him; and Janenoticed that it took him quite a long time to get the sand out of hismouth afterwards."|FALSE

There's the crown!'"|FALSE

836|"'No, you don't,' said the cook, in firm, undoubting tones. 'I've alwayswanted to be the Queen, God bless her! and I always thought what a goodone I should make; and now I'm going to.

836|"She sat up very straight on the carpet, and the copper-coloured ones,themselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers, madly stuckparrot feathers in their hair and began to dance. It was a dance such asyou have never seen; it made the children feel almost sure that thecook was right, and that they were all in a dream. Small, strange-shapeddrums were beaten, odd-sounding songs were sung, and the dance gotfaster and faster and odder and odder, till at last all the dancers fellon the sand tired out."|FALSE

836|"'Well--so long!' said the cook, getting heavily on to her feet, when thePhoenix had translated this request. 'No more kitchens and attics forme, thank you. I'm off to my royal palace, I am; and I only wish thishere dream would keep on for ever and ever.'"|FALSE
836|"She picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet,and the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and wornelastic-side boots before she disappeared into the shadow of the forest,surrounded by her dusky retainers, singing songs of rejoicing as theywent."|FALSE

836|"They followed the stranger, who seemed to have a great many more teethin his smile than are usual, and he led them through crooked streetsto the ranee's palace. I am not going to describe the ranee's palace,because I really have never seen the palace of a ranee, and Mr Kiplinghas. So you can read about it in his books. But I know exactly whathappened there."|FALSE
836|"The old ranee sat on a low-cushioned seat, and there were a lot of otherladies with her--all in trousers and veils, and sparkling with tinseland gold and jewels. And the brown, turbaned gentleman stood behind asort of carved screen, and interpreted what the children said and whatthe queen said. And when the queen asked to buy the carpet, the childrensaid 'No.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why?' asked the ranee."|FALSE
836|"And Jane briefly said why, and the interpreter interpreted. The queenspoke, and then the interpreter said--"|FALSE
836|"'My mistress says it is a good story, and you tell it all throughwithout thought of time.'"|FALSE
836|"And they had to. It made a long story, especially as it had all to betold twice--once by Cyril and once by the interpreter. Cyril ratherenjoyed himself. He warmed to his work, and told the tale of the Phoenixand the Carpet, and the Lone Tower, and the Queen-Cook, in language thatgrew insensibly more and more Arabian Nightsy, and the ranee and herladies listened to the interpreter, and rolled about on their fatcushions with laughter."|FALSE
836|"When the story was ended she spoke, and the interpreter explained thatshe had said, 'Little one, thou art a heaven-born teller of tales,' andshe threw him a string of turquoises from round her neck."|FALSE
836|"'OH, how lovely!' cried Jane and Anthea."|FALSE
836|"Cyril bowed several times, and then cleared his throat and said--"|FALSE
836|"'Thank her very, very much; but I would much rather she gave me some ofthe cheap things in the bazaar. Tell her I want them to sell again, andgive the money to buy clothes for poor people who haven't any.'"|FALSE
836|"'Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with itsprice,' said the queen, when this was translated."|FALSE
836|"But Cyril said very firmly, 'No, thank you. The things have got to besold to-day at our bazaar, and no one would buy a turquoise necklace atan English bazaar. They'd think it was sham, or else they'd want to knowwhere we got it.'"|FALSE
836|"So then the queen sent out for little pretty things, and her servantspiled the carpet with them."|FALSE
836|"'I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away,' she said,laughing."|FALSE
836|"But Anthea said, 'If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash ourhands and faces, she shall see a magic thing. We and the carpet and allthese brass trays and pots and carved things and stuffs and things willjust vanish away like smoke.'"|FALSE
836|"The queen clapped her hands at this idea, and lent the children asandal-wood comb inlaid with ivory lotus-flowers. And they washed theirfaces and hands in silver basins. Then Cyril made a very polite farewellspeech, and quite suddenly he ended with the words--"|FALSE
836|"'And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools.'"|FALSE
836|"And of course they were. And the queen and her ladies were left withtheir mouths open, gazing at the bare space on the inlaid marble floorwhere the carpet and the children had been."|FALSE
836|"'That is magic, if ever magic was!' said the queen, delighted with theincident; which, indeed, has given the ladies of that court something totalk about on wet days ever since."|FALSE
836|"Cyril's stories had taken some time, so had the meal of strange sweetfoods that they had had while the little pretty things were beingbought, and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted. Outside, thewinter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town houses."|FALSE
836|"'I'm glad we got washed in India,' said Cyril. 'We should have beenawfully late if we'd had to go home and scrub.'"|FALSE
836|"'Besides,' Robert said, 'it's much warmer washing in India. I shouldn'tmind it so much if we lived there.'"|FALSE
836|"The thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky spacebehind the point where the corners of two stalls met. The floor waslittered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes were heapedalong the wall."|FALSE
836|"The children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts oftable-covers and mats and things, embroidered beautifully by idleladies with no real work to do. They got out at the end, displacing asideboard-cloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of blue geraniums. Thegirls got out unobserved, so did Cyril; but Robert, as he cautiouslyemerged, was actually walked on by Mrs Biddle, who kept the stall. Herlarge, solid foot stood firmly on the small, solid hand of Robert andwho can blame Robert if he DID yell a little?"|FALSE
836|"A crowd instantly collected. Yells are very unusual at bazaars, andevery one was intensely interested. It was several seconds before thethree free children could make Mrs Biddle understand that what shewas walking on was not a schoolroom floor, or even, as she presentlysupposed, a dropped pin-cushion, but the living hand of a sufferingchild. When she became aware that she really had hurt him, she grew veryangry indeed. When people have hurt other people by accident, the onewho does the hurting is always much the angriest. I wonder why."|FALSE
836|"'I'm very sorry, I'm sure,' said Mrs Biddle; but she spoke more in angerthan in sorrow. 'Come out! whatever do you mean by creeping about underthe stalls, like earwigs?'"|FALSE
836|"'We were looking at the things in the corner.'"|FALSE
836|"'Such nasty, prying ways,' said Mrs Biddle, 'will never make yousuccessful in life. There's nothing there but packing and dust.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, isn't there!' said Jane. 'That's all you know.'"|FALSE
836|"'Little girl, don't be rude,' said Mrs Biddle, flushing violet."|FALSE
836|"'She doesn't mean to be; but there ARE some nice things there, all thesame,' said Cyril; who suddenly felt how impossible it was to inform thelistening crowd that all the treasures piled on the carpet were mother'scontributions to the bazaar. No one would believe it; and if they did,and wrote to thank mother, she would think--well, goodness only knewwhat she would think. The other three children felt the same."|FALSE
836|"'I should like to see them,' said a very nice lady, whose friendshad disappointed her, and who hoped that these might be belatedcontributions to her poorly furnished stall."|FALSE
836|"She looked inquiringly at Robert, who said, 'With pleasure, don'tmention it,' and dived back under Mrs Biddle's stall."|FALSE
836|"'I wonder you encourage such behaviour,' said Mrs Biddle. 'I alwaysspeak my mind, as you know, Miss Peasmarsh; and, I must say, I amsurprised.' She turned to the crowd. 'There is no entertainment here,'she said sternly. 'A very naughty little boy has accidentally hurthimself, but only slightly. Will you please disperse? It will onlyencourage him in naughtiness if he finds himself the centre ofattraction.'"|FALSE
836|"The crowd slowly dispersed. Anthea, speechless with fury, heard a nicecurate say, 'Poor little beggar!' and loved the curate at once and forever."|FALSE
836|"Then Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares brassand some inlaid sandalwood boxes."|FALSE
836|"'Liberty!' cried Miss Peasmarsh. 'Then Charles has not forgotten, afterall.'"|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said Mrs Biddle, with fierce politeness, 'these objects aredeposited behind MY stall. Some unknown donor who does good by stealth,and would blush if he could hear you claim the things. Of course theyare for me.'"|FALSE
836|"'My stall touches yours at the corner,' said poor Miss Peasmarsh,timidly, 'and my cousin did promise--'"|FALSE
836|"The children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled withthe crowd. Their feelings were too deep for words--till at last Robertsaid--"|FALSE
836|"'That stiff-starched PIG!'"|FALSE
836|"'And after all our trouble! I'm hoarse with gassing to that trouseredlady in India.'"|FALSE
836|"'The pig-lady's very, very nasty,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"It was Anthea who said, in a hurried undertone, 'She isn't very nice,and Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too. Who's got a pencil?'"|FALSE
836|"It was a long crawl, under three stalls, but Anthea did it. A largepiece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner."|FALSE
836|"She folded it to a square and wrote upon it, licking the pencil at everyword to make it mark quite blackly: 'All these Indian things are forpretty, nice Miss Peasmarsh's stall.' She thought of adding, 'There isnothing for Mrs Biddle;' but she saw that this might lead to suspicion,so she wrote hastily: 'From an unknown donna,' and crept back among theboards and trestles to join the others."|FALSE
836|"So that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee, and the cornerof the stall was lifted and shifted, so that stout clergymen and heavyladies could get to the corner without creeping under stalls, the bluepaper was discovered, and all the splendid, shining Indian things weregiven over to Miss Peasmarsh, and she sold them all, and got thirty-fivepounds for them."|FALSE
836|"'I don't understand about that blue paper,' said Mrs Biddle. 'It looksto me like the work of a lunatic. And saying you were nice and pretty!It's not the work of a sane person.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea and Jane begged Miss Peasmarsh to let them help her to sell thethings, because it was their brother who had announced the good newsthat the things had come. Miss Peasmarsh was very willing, for now herstall, that had been SO neglected, was surrounded by people who wantedto buy, and she was glad to be helped. The children noted that MrsBiddle had not more to do in the way of selling than she could managequite well. I hope they were not glad--for you should forgive yourenemies, even if they walk on your hands and then say it is all yournaughty fault. But I am afraid they were not so sorry as they ought tohave been."|FALSE
836|"It took some time to arrange the things on the stall. The carpet wasspread over it, and the dark colours showed up the brass and silver andivory things. It was a happy and busy afternoon, and when Miss Peasmarshand the girls had sold every single one of the little pretty things fromthe Indian bazaar, far, far away, Anthea and Jane went off with theboys to fish in the fishpond, and dive into the bran-pie, and hear thecardboard band, and the phonograph, and the chorus of singing birds thatwas done behind a screen with glass tubes and glasses of water."|FALSE
836|"They had a beautiful tea, suddenly presented to them by the nice curate,and Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more than three cakeseach. It was a merry party, and the curate was extremely pleasant toevery one, 'even to Miss Peasmarsh,' as Jane said afterwards."|FALSE
836|"'We ought to get back to the stall,' said Anthea, when no one couldpossibly eat any more, and the curate was talking in a low voice to MissPeas marsh about 'after Easter'."|FALSE
836|"'There's nothing to go back for,' said Miss Peasmarsh gaily; 'thanks toyou dear children we've sold everything.'"|FALSE
836|"'There--there's the carpet,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'Oh,' said Miss Peasmarsh, radiantly, 'don't bother about the carpet.I've sold even that. Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for it. She saidit would do for her servant's bedroom.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why,' said Jane, 'her servants don't HAVE carpets. We had cook fromher, and she told us so.'"|FALSE
836|"'No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, if YOU please,' said the curate,cheerfully; and Miss Peasmarsh laughed, and looked at him as though shehad never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing. But the others werestruck dumb. How could they say, 'The carpet is ours!' For who bringscarpets to bazaars?"|FALSE
836|"The children were now thoroughly wretched. But I am glad to say thattheir wretchedness did not make them forget their manners, as it doessometimes, even with grown-up people, who ought to know ever so muchbetter."|FALSE
836|"They said, 'Thank you very much for the jolly tea,' and 'Thanks forbeing so jolly,' and 'Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly time;'for the curate had stood fish-ponds, and bran-pies, and phonographs, andthe chorus of singing birds, and had stood them like a man. The girlshugged Miss Peasmarsh, and as they went away they heard the curate say--"|FALSE
836|"'Jolly little kids, yes, but what about--you will let it be directlyafter Easter. Ah, do say you will--'"|FALSE
836|"And Jane ran back and said, before Anthea could drag her away, 'What areyou going to do after Easter?'"|FALSE
836|"Miss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed. And the curatesaid--"|FALSE
836|"'I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Thank you,' said the curate, 'but I'm afraid I can't wait for that. Imust go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a bishop. I shouldhave no time afterwards.'"|FALSE
836|"'I've always thought I should marry a bishop,' said Jane: 'his apronswould come in so useful. Wouldn't YOU like to marry a bishop, MissPeasmarsh?'"|FALSE
836|"It was then that they dragged her away."|FALSE
836|"As it was Robert's hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on, it was decidedthat he had better not recall the incident to her mind, and so makeher angry again. Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things at the rivalstall, so they were not likely to be popular."|FALSE
836|"A hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril lessthan she would hate the others, so the others mingled with the crowd,and it was he who said to her--"|FALSE
836|"'Mrs Biddle, WE meant to have that carpet. Would you sell it to us? Wewould give you--'"|FALSE
836|"'Certainly not,' said Mrs Biddle. 'Go away, little boy.'"|FALSE
836|"There was that in her tone which showed Cyril, all too plainly, thehopelessness of persuasion. He found the others and said--"|FALSE
836|"'It's no use; she's like a lioness robbed of its puppies. We must watchwhere it goes--and--Anthea, I don't care what you say. It's our owncarpet. It wouldn't be burglary. It would be a sort of forlorn hoperescue party--heroic and daring and dashing, and not wrong at all.'"|FALSE
836|"The children still wandered among the gay crowd--but there was nopleasure there for them any more. The chorus of singing birds soundedjust like glass tubes being blown through water, and the phonographsimply made a horrid noise, so that you could hardly hear yourselfspeak. And the people were buying things they couldn't possibly want,and it all seemed very stupid. And Mrs Biddle had bought the wishingcarpet for ten shillings. And the whole of life was sad and grey anddusty, and smelt of slight gas escapes, and hot people, and cake andcrumbs, and all the children were very tired indeed."|FALSE
836|"They found a corner within sight of the carpet, and there they waitedmiserably, till it was far beyond their proper bedtime. And when it wasten the people who had bought things went away, but the people who hadbeen selling stayed to count up their money."|FALSE
836|"'And to jaw about it,' said Robert. 'I'll never go to another bazaar aslong as ever I live. My hand is swollen as big as a pudding. I expectthe nails in her horrible boots were poisoned.'"|FALSE
836|"Just then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said--"|FALSE
836|"'Everything is over now; you had better go home.'"|FALSE
836|"So they went. And then they waited on the pavement under the gas lamp,where ragged children had been standing all the evening to listen tothe band, and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud till Mrs Biddlecame out and was driven away in a cab with the many things she hadn'tsold, and the few things she had bought--among others the carpet. Theother stall-holders left their things at the school till Monday morning,but Mrs Biddle was afraid some one would steal some of them, so she tookthem in a cab."|FALSE
836|"The children, now too desperate to care for mud or appearances, hungon behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddle's house. When she and thecarpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said--"|FALSE
836|"'Don't let's burgle--I mean do daring and dashing rescue acts--tillwe've given her a chance. Let's ring and ask to see her.'"|FALSE
836|"The others hated to do this, but at last they agreed, on condition thatAnthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary afterwards, ifit really had to come to that."|FALSE
836|"So they knocked and rang, and a scared-looking parlourmaid opened thefront door. While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw her. She wasin the dining-room, and she had already pushed back the table and spreadout the carpet to see how it looked on the floor."|FALSE
836|"'I knew she didn't want it for her servants' bedroom,' Jane muttered."|FALSE
836|"Anthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid, and theothers followed her. Mrs Biddle had her back to them, and was smoothingdown the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on the handof Robert. So that they were all in the room, and Cyril, with greatpresence of mind, had shut the room door before she saw them."|FALSE
836|"'Who is it, Jane?' she asked in a sour voice; and then turning suddenly,she saw who it was. Once more her face grew violet--a deep, dark violet.'You wicked daring little things!' she cried, 'how dare you come here?At this time of night, too. Be off, or I'll send for the police.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't be angry,' said Anthea, soothingly, 'we only wanted to ask youto let us have the carpet. We have quite twelve shillings between us,and--'"|FALSE
836|"'How DARE you?' cried Mrs Biddle, and her voice shook with angriness."|FALSE
836|"'You do look horrid,' said Jane suddenly."|FALSE
836|"Mrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers. 'You rude,barefaced child!' she said."|FALSE
836|"Anthea almost shook Jane; but Jane pushed forward in spite of her."|FALSE
836|"'It really IS our nursery carpet,' she said, 'you ask ANY ONE if itisn't.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let's wish ourselves home,' said Cyril in a whisper."|FALSE
836|"'No go,' Robert whispered back, 'she'd be there too, and raving mad aslikely as not. Horrid thing, I hate her!'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper,' cried Anthea,suddenly. 'It's worth trying,' she said to herself."|FALSE
836|"Mrs Biddle's face grew from purple to violet, and from violet to mauve,and from mauve to pink. Then she smiled quite a jolly smile."|FALSE
836|"'Why, so I am!' she said, 'what a funny idea! Why shouldn't I be in agood temper, my dears.'"|FALSE
836|"Once more the carpet had done its work, and not on Mrs Biddle alone. Thechildren felt suddenly good and happy."|FALSE
836|"'You're a jolly good sort,' said Cyril. 'I see that now. I'm sorry wevexed you at the bazaar to-day.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not another word,' said the changed Mrs Biddle. 'Of course you shallhave the carpet, my dears, if you've taken such a fancy to it. No, no; Iwon't have more than the ten shillings I paid.'"|FALSE
836|"'It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the bazaar,'said Anthea; 'but it really IS our nursery carpet. It got to the bazaarby mistake, with some other things.'"|FALSE
836|"'Did it really, now? How vexing!' said Mrs Biddle, kindly. 'Well, mydears, I can very well give the extra ten shillings; so you take yourcarpet and we'll say no more about it. Have a piece of cake before yougo! I'm so sorry I stepped on your hand, my boy. Is it all right now?'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, thank you,' said Robert. 'I say, you ARE good.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not at all,' said Mrs Biddle, heartily. 'I'm delighted to be able togive any little pleasure to you dear children.'"|FALSE

836|"'WELL!' said Cyril as they went along the street."|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Robert, 'and the odd part is that you feel just as if itwas REAL--her being so jolly, I mean--and not only the carpet making hernice.'"|FALSE
836|"'Perhaps it IS real,' said Anthea, 'only it was covered up withcrossness and tiredness and things, and the carpet took them away.'"|FALSE
836|"'I hope it'll keep them away,' said Jane; 'she isn't ugly at all whenshe laughs.'"|FALSE
836|"The carpet has done many wonders in its day; but the case of MrsBiddle is, I think, the most wonderful.

836|"'Do you think it's worn out? The wishing part of it, I mean?' Robertanxiously asked the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'It's not that,' said the Phoenix; 'but--well--what did you wish--?'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh! I see what it means,' said Robert, with deep disgust; 'it's likethe end of a fairy story in a Sunday magazine. How perfectly beastly!'"|FALSE
836|"'You mean it means we can do kind and good actions where we are? I see.I suppose it wants us to carry coals for the cook or make clothesfor the bare heathens. Well, I simply won't. And the last day andeverything. Look here!' Cyril spoke loudly and firmly. 'We want to gosomewhere really interesting, where we have a chance of doing somethinggood and kind; we don't want to do it here, but somewhere else. See?Now, then.'"|FALSE
836|"The obedient carpet started instantly, and the four children and onebird fell in a heap together, and as they fell were plunged in perfectdarkness."|FALSE
836|"'Are you all there?' said Anthea, breathlessly, through the black dark.Every one owned that it was there."|FALSE
836|"'Where are we? Oh! how shivery and wet it is! Ugh!--oh!--I've put myhand in a puddle!'"|FALSE
836|"'Has any one got any matches?' said Anthea, hopelessly. She felt surethat no one would have any."|FALSE
836|"It was then that Robert, with a radiant smile of triumph that was quitewasted in the darkness, where, of course, no one could see anything,drew out of his pocket a box of matches, struck a match and lighted acandle--two candles.

836|"'Bobs,' said Anthea, suddenly, 'do you know where we are? This isthe underground passage, and look there--there's the money and themoney-bags, and everything.'"|FALSE
836|"By this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles, andno one could help seeing that Anthea spoke the truth."|FALSE
836|"'It seems an odd place to do good and kind acts in, though,' said Jane.'There's no one to do them to.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't you be too sure,' said Cyril; 'just round the next turning wemight find a prisoner who has languished here for years and years, andwe could take him out on our carpet and restore him to his sorrowingfriends.'"|FALSE
836|"'Of course we could,' said Robert, standing up and holding the candleabove his head to see further off; 'or we might find the bones of apoor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried properly--that'salways a kind action in books, though I never could see what bonesmatter.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish you wouldn't,' said Jane."|FALSE

836|"'And _I_ will, too,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"Robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy."|FALSE

836|"Jane had opened her mouth to scream, but before she could decide how youbegan when you wanted to faint, the golden voice of the Phoenix spokethrough the gloom."|FALSE
836|"'Peace!' it said; 'there are no bones here except the small but usefulsets that you have inside you. And you did not invite me to come outwith you to hear you talk about bones, but to see you do some good andkind action.'"|FALSE
836|"'We can't do it here,' said Robert, sulkily."|FALSE
836|"'No,' rejoined the bird. 'The only thing we can do here, it seems, is totry to frighten our little sisters.'"|FALSE
836|"'He didn't, really, and I'm not so VERY little,' said Jane, ratherungratefully."|FALSE
836|"Robert was silent. It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they hadbetter take the money and go."|FALSE
836|"'That wouldn't be a kind act, except to ourselves; and it wouldn't begood, whatever way you look at it,' said Anthea, 'to take money that'snot ours.'"|FALSE

836|"'That wouldn't make it right to steal,' said Anthea, stoutly."|FALSE

836|"'It can't be stealing if--'"|FALSE
836|"'That's right,' said Robert, with ironical approval; 'stand here all dayarguing while the candles burn out. You'll like it awfully when it's alldark again--and bony.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let's get out, then,' said Anthea. 'We can argue as we go.' So theyrolled up the carpet and went. But when they had crept along to theplace where the passage led into the topless tower they found the wayblocked by a great stone, which they could not move."|FALSE
836|"'There!' said Robert. 'I hope you're satisfied!'"|FALSE
836|"'Everything has two ends,' said the Phoenix, softly; 'even a quarrel ora secret passage.'"|FALSE
836|"So they turned round and went back, and Robert was made to go first withone of the candles, because he was the one who had begun to talk aboutbones. And Cyril carried the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'I wish you hadn't put bones into our heads,' said Jane, as they wentalong."|FALSE
836|"'I didn't; you always had them. More bones than brains,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"The passage was long, and there were arches and steps and turnings anddark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing. The passage endedin a flight of steps. Robert went up them."|FALSE
836|"Suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of Jane, andeverybody screamed, 'Oh! what is it?'"|FALSE
836|"'I've only bashed my head in,' said Robert, when he had groaned for sometime; 'that's all. Don't mention it; I like it. The stairs just go rightslap into the ceiling, and it's a stone ceiling. You can't do good andkind actions underneath a paving-stone.'"|FALSE
836|"'Stairs aren't made to lead just to paving-stones as a general rule,'said the Phoenix. 'Put your shoulder to the wheel.'"|FALSE
836|"'There isn't any wheel,' said the injured Robert, still rubbing hishead."|FALSE
836|"But Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair, and was already shovinghis hardest against the stone above. Of course, it did not give in theleast."|FALSE
836|"'If it's a trap-door--' said Cyril. And he stopped shoving and began tofeel about with his hands."|FALSE
836|"'Yes, there is a bolt. I can't move it.'"|FALSE
836|"By a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oil-can of his father'sbicycle; he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs, and he layon his back, with his head on the top step and his feet straggling downamong his young relations, and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rustand oil fell down on his face. One even went into his mouth--open, as hepanted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position. Thenhe tried again, but still the bolt would not move. So now he tied hishandkerchief--the one with the bacon-fat and marmalade on it--to thebolt, and Robert's handkerchief to that, in a reef knot, which cannotcome undone however much you pull, and, indeed, gets tighter and tighterthe more you pull it. This must not be confused with a granny knot,which comes undone if you look at it. And then he and Robert pulled,and the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too, andsuddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch, and they all rolledtogether to the bottom of the stairs--all but the Phoenix, which hadtaken to its wings when the pulling began."|FALSE
836|"Nobody was hurt much, because the rolled-up carpet broke their fall; andnow, indeed, the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose, forthe stone allowed them to heave it up. They felt it give; dust fellfreely on them."|FALSE
836|"'Now, then,' cried Robert, forgetting his head and his temper, 'push alltogether. One, two, three!'"|FALSE
836|"The stone was heaved up. It swung up on a creaking, unwilling hinge, andshowed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight; and it fell back with abang against something that kept it upright. Every one climbed out,but there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in thelittle paved house where they found themselves, so when the Phoenix hadfluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down, and it closedlike a trap-door, as indeed it was."|FALSE
836|"You can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were. Fortunatelythere was no one to see them but each other. The place they were inwas a little shrine, built on the side of a road that went winding upthrough yellow-green fields to the topless tower. Below them were fieldsand orchards, all bare boughs and brown furrows, and little houses andgardens. The shrine was a kind of tiny chapel with no front wall--just aplace for people to stop and rest in and wish to be good. So the Phoenixtold them. There was an image that had once been brightly coloured, butthe rain and snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine,and the poor image was dull and weather-stained. Under it was written:'St Jean de Luz. Priez pour nous.' It was a sad little place, veryneglected and lonely, and yet it was nice, Anthea thought, that poortravellers should come to this little rest-house in the hurry and worryof their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes, and think aboutbeing good. The thought of St Jean de Luz--who had, no doubt, in histime, been very good and kind--made Anthea want more than ever to dosomething kind and good."|FALSE
836|"'Tell us,' she said to the Phoenix, 'what is the good and kind actionthe carpet brought us here to do?'"|FALSE
836|"'I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tellthem about it,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'And give it them ALL?' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Yes. But whose is it?'"|FALSE
836|"'I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of thecastle,' said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a good one."|FALSE
836|"They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road. Alittle way on they found a tiny spring, bubbling out of the hillside andfalling into a rough stone basin surrounded by draggled hart's-tongueferns, now hardly green at all. Here the children washed their handsand faces and dried them on their pocket-handkerchiefs, which always,on these occasions, seem unnaturally small. Cyril's and Robert'shandkerchiefs, indeed, rather undid the effects of the wash. But inspite of this the party certainly looked cleaner than before."|FALSE
836|"The first house they came to was a little white house with greenshutters and a slate roof. It stood in a prim little garden, and downeach side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers to growin; but all the flowers were dead now."|FALSE
836|"Along one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda, built of polesand trellis-work, and a vine crawled all over it. It was wider than ourEnglish verandas, and Anthea thought it must look lovely when thegreen leaves and the grapes were there; but now there were only dry,reddish-brown stalks and stems, with a few withered leaves caught inthem."|FALSE
836|"The children walked up to the front door. It was green and narrow. Achain with a handle hung beside it, and joined itself quite openly to arusty bell that hung under the porch. Cyril had pulled the bell andits noisy clang was dying away before the terrible thought came to all.Cyril spoke it."|FALSE
836|"'My hat!' he breathed. 'We don't know any French!'"|FALSE
836|"At this moment the door opened. A very tall, lean lady, with paleringlets like whitey-brown paper or oak shavings, stood before them. Shehad an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron. Her eyes were smalland grey and not pretty, and the rims were red, as though she had beencrying."|FALSE
836|"She addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreignlanguage, and ended with something which they were sure was a question.Of course, no one could answer it."|FALSE
836|"'What does she say?' Robert asked, looking down into the hollow of hisjacket, where the Phoenix was nestling. But before the Phoenix couldanswer, the whitey-brown lady's face was lighted up by a most charmingsmile."|FALSE
836|"'You--you ar-r-re fr-r-rom the England!' she cried. 'I love so muchthe England. Mais entrez--entrez donc tous! Enter, then--enter all. Oneessuyes his feet on the carpet.' She pointed to the mat."|FALSE
836|"'We only wanted to ask--'"|FALSE
836|"'I shall say you all that what you wish,' said the lady. 'Enter only!'"|FALSE
836|"So they all went in, wiping their feet on a very clean mat, and puttingthe carpet in a safe corner of the veranda."|FALSE
836|"'The most beautiful days of my life,' said the lady, as she shut thedoor, 'did pass themselves in England. And since long time I have notheard an English voice to repeal me the past.'"|FALSE
836|"This warm welcome embarrassed every one, but most the boys, for thefloor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles, andthe floor of the sitting-room so very shiny--like a blacklooking-glass--that each felt as though he had on far more boots thanusual, and far noisier."|FALSE
836|"There was a wood fire, very small and very bright, on the hearth--neatlittle logs laid on brass fire-dogs. Some portraits of powdered ladiesand gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale walls. There were silvercandlesticks on the mantelpiece, and there were chairs and a table, veryslim and polite, with slender legs. The room was extremely bare, butwith a bright foreign bareness that was very cheerful, in an odd way ofits own. At the end of the polished table a very un-English little boysat on a footstool in a high-backed, uncomfortable-looking chair. Hewore black velvet, and the kind of collar--all frills and lacey--thatRobert would rather have died than wear; but then the little French boywas much younger than Robert."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, how pretty!' said every one. But no one meant the little Frenchboy, with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety short hair."|FALSE
836|"What every one admired was a little, little Christmas-tree, very green,and standing in a very red little flower-pot, and hung round with verybright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper. There were tinycandles on the tree, but they were not lighted yet."|FALSE
836|"'But yes--is it not that it is genteel?' said the lady. 'Sit down youthen, and let us see.'"|FALSE
836|"The children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the wall, andthe lady lighted a long, slim red taper at the wood flame, and then shedrew the curtains and lit the little candles, and when they were alllighted the little French boy suddenly shouted, 'Bravo, ma tante! Oh,que c'est gentil,' and the English children shouted 'Hooray!'"|FALSE
836|"Then there was a struggle in the breast of Robert, and out fluttered thePhoenix--spread his gold wings, flew to the top of the Christmas-tree,and perched there."|FALSE
836|"'Ah! catch it, then,' cried the lady; 'it will itself burn--your genteelparrakeet!'"|FALSE
836|"'It won't,' said Robert, 'thank you.'"|FALSE
836|"And the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands; but the ladywas so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up and down onthe shiny walnut-wood table."|FALSE
836|"'Is it that it talks?' asked the lady."|FALSE
836|"And the Phoenix replied in excellent French. It said, 'Parfaitement,madame!'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, the pretty parrakeet,' said the lady. 'Can it say still of otherthings?'"|FALSE
836|"And the Phoenix replied, this time in English, 'Why are you sad so nearChristmas-time?'"|FALSE
836|"The children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise, forthe youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice thatstrangers have been crying, and much worse to ask them the reason oftheir tears. And, of course, the lady began to cry again, very muchindeed, after calling the Phoenix a bird without a heart; and she couldnot find her handkerchief, so Anthea offered hers, which was still verydamp and no use at all. She also hugged the lady, and this seemed to beof more use than the handkerchief, so that presently the lady stoppedcrying, and found her own handkerchief and dried her eyes, and calledAnthea a cherished angel."|FALSE
836|"'I am sorry we came just when you were so sad,' said Anthea, 'but wereally only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, my little angel,' said the poor lady, sniffing, 'to-day and forhundreds of years the castle is to us, to our family. To-morrow it mustthat I sell it to some strangers--and my little Henri, who ignoresall, he will not have never the lands paternal. But what will you? Hisfather, my brother--Mr the Marquis--has spent much of money, and it themust, despite the sentiments of familial respect, that I admit that mysainted father he also--'"|FALSE
836|"'How would you feel if you found a lot of money--hundreds and thousandsof gold pieces?' asked Cyril."|FALSE
836|"The lady smiled sadly."|FALSE
836|"'Ah! one has already recounted to you the legend?' she said. 'It istrue that one says that it is long time; oh! but long time, one of ourancestors has hid a treasure--of gold, and of gold, and of gold--enoughto enrich my little Henri for the life. But all that, my children, it isbut the accounts of fays--'"|FALSE
836|"'She means fairy stories,' whispered the Phoenix to Robert. 'Tell herwhat you have found.'"|FALSE
836|"So Robert told, while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear sheshould faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her with theearnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight."|FALSE
836|"'It's no use explaining how we got in,' said Robert, when he had toldof the finding of the treasure, 'because you would find it a littledifficult to understand, and much more difficult to believe. But we canshow you where the gold is and help you to fetch it away.'"|FALSE
836|"The lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the hugsof the girls."|FALSE
836|"'No, he's not making it up,' said Anthea; 'it's true, TRUE, TRUE!--andwe are so glad.'"|FALSE
836|"'You would not be capable to torment an old woman?' she said; 'and it isnot possible that it be a dream.'"|FALSE
836|"'It really IS true,' said Cyril; 'and I congratulate you very much.'"|FALSE
836|"His tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the rapturesof the others."|FALSE
836|"'If I do not dream,' she said, 'Henri come to Manon--and you--you shallcome all with me to Mr the Curate. Is it not?'"|FALSE
836|"Manon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchieftwisted round her head. She took Henri, who was already sleepy with theexcitement of his Christmas-tree and his visitors, and when the lady hadput on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black silk bonnet and a pairof black wooden clogs over her black cashmere house-boots, the wholeparty went down the road to a little white house--very like the one theyhad left--where an old priest, with a good face, welcomed them with apoliteness so great that it hid his astonishment."|FALSE
836|"The lady, with her French waving hands and her shrugging Frenchshoulders and her trembling French speech, told the story. And now thepriest, who knew no English, shrugged HIS shoulders and waved HIS handsand spoke also in French."|FALSE
836|"'He thinks,' whispered the Phoenix, 'that her troubles have turned herbrain. What a pity you know no French!'"|FALSE
836|"'I do know a lot of French,' whispered Robert, indignantly; 'but it'sall about the pencil of the gardener's son and the penknife of thebaker's niece--nothing that anyone ever wants to say.'"|FALSE

836|"'Tell me what to say.'"|FALSE
836|"'Say \"C'est vrai, monsieur. Venez donc voir,\"' said the Phoenix; andthen Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly saying,very loudly and distinctly--"|FALSE
836|"'Say vray, mossoo; venny dong vwaw.'"|FALSE
836|"The priest was disappointed when he found that Robert's French began andended with these useful words; but, at any rate, he saw that if the ladywas mad she was not the only one, and he put on a big beavery hat, andgot a candle and matches and a spade, and they all went up the hill tothe wayside shrine of St John of Luz."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' said Robert, 'I will go first and show you where it is.'"|FALSE
836|"So they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade, and Robert didgo first, and they all followed and found the golden treasure exactly asthey had left it. And every one was flushed with the joy of performingsuch a wonderfully kind action."|FALSE
836|"Then the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy, as Frenchpeople do, and knelt down and touched the money, and talked very fastand both together, and the lady embraced all the children three timeseach, and called them 'little garden angels,' and then she and thepriest shook each other by both hands again, and talked, and talked, andtalked, faster and more Frenchy than you would have believed possible.And the children were struck dumb with joy and pleasure."|FALSE
836|"'Get away NOW,' said the Phoenix softly, breaking in on the radiantdream."|FALSE
836|"So the children crept away, and out through the little shrine, and thelady and the priest were so tearfully, talkatively happy that they nevernoticed that the guardian angels had gone."|FALSE
836|"The 'garden angels' ran down the hill to the lady's little house, wherethey had left the carpet on the veranda, and they spread it out andsaid 'Home,' and no one saw them disappear, except little Henri, whohad flattened his nose into a white button against the window-glass, andwhen he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had been dreaming. So thatwas all right."|FALSE

836|"When you hear that the four children found themselves at WaterlooStation quite un-taken-care-of, and with no one to meet them, it maymake you think that their parents were neither kind nor careful. But ifyou think this you will be wrong. The fact is, mother arranged with AuntEmma that she was to meet the children at Waterloo, when they went backfrom their Christmas holiday at Lyndhurst. The train was fixed, but notthe day. Then mother wrote to Aunt Emma, giving her careful instructionsabout the day and the hour, and about luggage and cabs and things, andgave the letter to Robert to post. But the hounds happened to meet nearRufus Stone that morning, and what is more, on the way to the meet theymet Robert, and Robert met them, and instantly forgot all about postingAunt Emma's letter, and never thought of it again until he andthe others had wandered three times up and down the platform atWaterloo--which makes six in all--and had bumped against old gentlemen,and stared in the faces of ladies, and been shoved by people in a hurry,and 'by-your-leaved' by porters with trucks, and were quite, quite surethat Aunt Emma was not there. Then suddenly the true truth of what hehad forgotten to do came home to Robert, and he said, 'Oh, crikey!' andstood still with his mouth open, and let a porter with a Gladstone bagin each hand and a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavilyinto him, and never so much as said, 'Where are you shoving to now?' or,'Look out where you're going, can't you?'

No; we've got enough fora growler among us, but not enough for tickets to the New Forest. Wemust just go home. They won't be so savage when they find we've reallygot home all right.

836|"A four-wheeled cabman was called--his cab was one of the old-fashionedkind with straw in the bottom--and he was asked by Anthea to drive themvery carefully to their address. This he did, and the price he askedfor doing so was exactly the value of the gold coin grandpapa had givenCyril for Christmas. This cast a gloom; but Cyril would never havestooped to argue about a cab-fare, for fear the cabman should think hewas not accustomed to take cabs whenever he wanted them. For a reasonthat was something like this he told the cabman to put the luggageon the steps, and waited till the wheels of the growler had grittilyretired before he rang the bell."|FALSE

836|"The latch rattled, and clicked. Then the flap of the letter-box lifteditself--every one saw it by the flickering light of the gas-lamp thatshone through the leafless lime-tree by the gate--a golden eye seemed towink at them through the letter-slit, and a cautious beak whispered--"|FALSE
836|"'Are you alone?'"|FALSE
836|"'It's the Phoenix,' said every one, in a voice so joyous, and so full ofrelief, as to be a sort of whispered shout."|FALSE
836|"'Hush!' said the voice from the letter-box slit. 'Your slaves have gonea-merry-making. The latch of this portal is too stiff for my beak.But at the side--the little window above the shelf whereon your breadlies--it is not fastened.'"|FALSE
836|"'Righto!' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"And Anthea added, 'I wish you'd meet us there, dear Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"The children crept round to the pantry window. It is at the side of thehouse, and there is a green gate labelled 'Tradesmen's Entrance', whichis always kept bolted. But if you get one foot on the fence between youand next door, and one on the handle of the gate, you are over beforeyou know where you are. This, at least, was the experience of Cyril andRobert, and even, if the truth must be told, of Anthea and Jane. So inalmost no time all four were in the narrow gravelled passage that runsbetween that house and the next."|FALSE
836|"Then Robert made a back, and Cyril hoisted himself up and got hisknicker-bockered knee on the concrete window-sill. He dived into thepantry head first, as one dives into water, and his legs waved in theair as he went, just as your legs do when you are first beginningto learn to dive. The soles of his boots--squarish muddypatches--disappeared."|FALSE
836|"'Give me a leg up,' said Robert to his sisters."|FALSE
836|"'No, you don't,' said Jane firmly. 'I'm not going to be left outsidehere with just Anthea, and have something creep up behind us out of thedark. Squirrel can go and open the back door.'"|FALSE
836|"A light had sprung awake in the pantry. Cyril always said the Phoenixturned the gas on with its beak, and lighted it with a waft of its wing;but he was excited at the time, and perhaps he really did it himselfwith matches, and then forgot all about it. He let the others in by theback door. And when it had been bolted again the children went all overthe house and lighted every single gas-jet they could find. For theycouldn't help feeling that this was just the dark dreary winter'sevening when an armed burglar might easily be expected to appear at anymoment. There is nothing like light when you are afraid of burglars--orof anything else, for that matter."|FALSE
836|"And when all the gas-jets were lighted it was quite clear that thePhoenix had made no mistake, and that Eliza and cook were really out,and that there was no one in the house except the four children, and thePhoenix, and the carpet, and the blackbeetles who lived in the cupboardson each side of the nursery fire-place. These last were very pleasedthat the children had come home again, especially when Anthea hadlighted the nursery fire. But, as usual, the children treated the lovinglittle blackbeetles with coldness and disdain."|FALSE
836|"I wonder whether you know how to light a fire? I don't mean how tostrike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a firesomeone has laid ready, but how to lay and light a fire all by yourself.I will tell you how Anthea did it, and if ever you have to light oneyourself you may remember how it is done. First, she raked out the ashesof the fire that had burned there a week ago--for Eliza had actuallynever done this, though she had had plenty of time. In doing this Antheaknocked her knuckle and made it bleed. Then she laid the largest andhandsomest cinders in the bottom of the grate. Then she took a sheetof old newspaper (you ought never to light a fire with to-day'snewspaper--it will not burn well, and there are other reasons againstit), and tore it into four quarters, and screwed each of these into aloose ball, and put them on the cinders; then she got a bundle of woodand broke the string, and stuck the sticks in so that their front endsrested on the bars, and the back ends on the back of the paper balls.In doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string, and when shebroke it, two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on the cheek. Then sheput more cinders and some bits of coal--no dust. She put most of thaton her hands, but there seemed to be enough left for her face. Thenshe lighted the edges of the paper balls, and waited till she heard thefizz-crack-crack-fizz of the wood as it began to burn. Then she went andwashed her hands and face under the tap in the back kitchen."|FALSE
836|"Of course, you need not bark your knuckles, or cut your finger, orbruise your cheek with wood, or black yourself all over; but otherwise,this is a very good way to light a fire in London. In the real countryfires are lighted in a different and prettier way."|FALSE
836|"But it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards, whereveryou are."|FALSE
836|"While Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with thecheerful blaze, Jane had set the table for--I was going to say tea, butthe meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea. Let us call it atea-ish meal. There was tea, certainly, for Anthea's fire blazed andcrackled so kindly that it really seemed to be affectionately invitingthe kettle to come and sit upon its lap. So the kettle was brought andtea made. But no milk could be found--so every one had six lumps ofsugar to each cup instead. The things to eat, on the other hand, werenicer than usual. The boys looked about very carefully, and found inthe pantry some cold tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and part of a coldpudding--very much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home. Andin the kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake, a pot of strawberryjam, and about a pound of mixed candied fruit, with soft crumbly slabsof delicious sugar in each cup of lemon, orange, or citron."|FALSE
836|"It was indeed, as Jane said, 'a banquet fit for an Arabian Knight.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix perched on Robert's chair, and listened kindly andpolitely to all they had to tell it about their visit to Lyndhurst,and underneath the table, by just stretching a toe down rather far, thefaithful carpet could be felt by all--even by Jane, whose legs were veryshort."|FALSE
836|"'Your slaves will not return to-night,' said the Phoenix. 'They sleepunder the roof of the cook's stepmother's aunt, who is, I gather,hostess to a large party to-night in honour of her husband's cousin'ssister-in-law's mother's ninetieth birthday.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't think they ought to have gone without leave,' said Anthea,'however many relations they have, or however old they are; but Isuppose we ought to wash up.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not our business about the leave,' said Cyril, firmly, 'but Isimply won't wash up for them. We got it, and we'll clear it away; andthen we'll go somewhere on the carpet. It's not often we get a chanceof being out all night. We can go right away to the other side of theequator, to the tropical climes, and see the sun rise over the greatPacific Ocean.'"|FALSE
836|"'Right you are,' said Robert. 'I always did want to see the SouthernCross and the stars as big as gas-lamps.'"|FALSE
836|"'DON'T go,' said Anthea, very earnestly, 'because I COULDN'T. I'm SUREmother wouldn't like us to leave the house and I should hate to be lefthere alone.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'd stay with you,' said Jane loyally."|FALSE
836|"'I know you would,' said Anthea gratefully, 'but even with you I'd muchrather not.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said Cyril, trying to be kind and amiable, 'I don't want you todo anything you think's wrong, BUT--'"|FALSE
836|"He was silent; this silence said many things."|FALSE
836|"'I don't see,' Robert was beginning, when Anthea interrupted--"|FALSE
836|"'I'm quite sure. Sometimes you just think a thing's wrong, and sometimesyou KNOW. And this is a KNOW time.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix turned kind golden eyes on her and opened a friendly beak tosay--"|FALSE
836|"'When it is, as you say, a \"know time\", there is no more to be said. Andyour noble brothers would never leave you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Of course not,' said Cyril rather quickly. And Robert said so too."|FALSE
836|"'I myself,' the Phoenix went on, 'am willing to help in any waypossible. I will go personally--either by carpet or on the wing--andfetch you anything you can think of to amuse you during the evening. Inorder to waste no time I could go while you wash up.--Why,' it went onin a musing voice, 'does one wash up teacups and wash down the stairs?'"|FALSE
836|"'You couldn't wash stairs up, you know,' said Anthea, 'unless you beganat the bottom and went up feet first as you washed. I wish cook wouldtry that way for a change.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't,' said Cyril, briefly. 'I should hate the look of herelastic-side boots sticking up.'"|FALSE
836|"'This is mere trifling,' said the Phoenix. 'Come, decide what I shallfetch for you. I can get you anything you like.'"|FALSE
836|"But of course they couldn't decide. Many things were suggested--arocking-horse, jewelled chessmen, an elephant, a bicycle, a motor-car,books with pictures, musical instruments, and many other things. Buta musical instrument is agreeable only to the player, unless he haslearned to play it really well; books are not sociable, bicycles cannotbe ridden without going out of doors, and the same is true of motor-carsand elephants. Only two people can play chess at once with one set ofchessmen (and anyway it's very much too much like lessons for a game),and only one can ride on a rocking-horse. Suddenly, in the midst of thediscussion, the Phoenix spread its wings and fluttered to the floor, andfrom there it spoke."|FALSE
836|"'I gather,' it said, 'from the carpet, that it wants you to let it goto its old home, where it was born and brought up, and it will returnwithin the hour laden with a number of the most beautiful and delightfulproducts of its native land.'"|FALSE
836|"'What IS its native land?'"|FALSE
836|"'I didn't gather. But since you can't agree, and time is passing, andthe tea-things are not washed down--I mean washed up--'"|FALSE
836|"'I votes we do,' said Robert. 'It'll stop all this jaw, anyway. And it'snot bad to have surprises. Perhaps it's a Turkey carpet, and it mightbring us Turkish delight.'"|FALSE
836|"'Or a Turkish patrol,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'Or a Turkish bath,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Or a Turkish towel,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Nonsense,' Robert urged, 'it said beautiful and delightful, and towelsand baths aren't THAT, however good they may be for you. Let it go. Isuppose it won't give us the slip,' he added, pushing back his chair andstanding up."|FALSE
836|"'Hush!' said the Phoenix; 'how can you? Don't trample on its feelingsjust because it's only a carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'But how can it do it--unless one of us is on it to do the wishing?'asked Robert. He spoke with a rising hope that it MIGHT be necessary forone to go and why not Robert? But the Phoenix quickly threw cold wateron his new-born dream."|FALSE
836|"'Why, you just write your wish on a paper, and pin it on the carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"So a leaf was torn from Anthea's arithmetic book, and on it Cyril wrotein large round-hand the following:"|FALSE
836|"We wish you to go to your dear native home, and bring back the mostbeautiful and delightful productions of it you can--and not to be gonelong, please."|FALSE
836|"                    (Signed)  CYRIL.                              ROBERT.                              ANTHEA.                              JANE."|FALSE
836|"Then the paper was laid on the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Writing down, please,' said the Phoenix; 'the carpet can't read a paperwhose back is turned to it, any more than you can.'"|FALSE
836|"It was pinned fast, and the table and chairs having been moved, thecarpet simply and suddenly vanished, rather like a patch of water on ahearth under a fierce fire. The edges got smaller and smaller, and thenit disappeared from sight."|FALSE
836|"'It may take it some time to collect the beautiful and delightfulthings,' said the Phoenix. 'I should wash up--I mean wash down.'"|FALSE
836|"So they did. There was plenty of hot water left in the kettle, and everyone helped--even the Phoenix, who took up cups by their handles with itsclever claws and dipped them in the hot water, and then stood them onthe table ready for Anthea to dry them. But the bird was rather slow,because, as it said, though it was not above any sort of honest work,messing about with dish-water was not exactly what it had been broughtup to. Everything was nicely washed up, and dried, and put in its properplace, and the dish-cloth washed and hung on the edge of the copperto dry, and the tea-cloth was hung on the line that goes across thescullery. (If you are a duchess's child, or a king's, or a person ofhigh social position's child, you will perhaps not know the differencebetween a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth; but in that case your nurse hasbeen better instructed than you, and she will tell you all about it.)And just as eight hands and one pair of claws were being dried on theroller-towel behind the scullery door there came a strange sound fromthe other side of the kitchen wall--the side where the nursery was. Itwas a very strange sound, indeed--most odd, and unlike any other soundsthe children had ever heard. At least, they had heard sounds as muchlike it as a toy engine's whistle is like a steam siren's."|FALSE
836|"'The carpet's come back,' said Robert; and the others felt that he wasright."|FALSE
836|"'But what has it brought with it?' asked Jane. 'It sounds likeLeviathan, that great beast.'"|FALSE
836|"'It couldn't have been made in India, and have brought elephants? Evenbaby ones would be rather awful in that room,' said Cyril. 'I vote wetake it in turns to squint through the keyhole.'"|FALSE
836|"They did--in the order of their ages. The Phoenix, being the eldest bysome thousands of years, was entitled to the first peep. But--"|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' it said, ruffling its golden feathers and sneezing softly;'looking through keyholes always gives me a cold in my golden eyes.'"|FALSE
836|"So Cyril looked."|FALSE
836|"'I see something grey moving,' said he."|FALSE
836|"'It's a zoological garden of some sort, I bet,' said Robert, when he hadtaken his turn. And the soft rustling, bustling, ruffling, scuffling,shuffling, fluffling noise went on inside."|FALSE
836|"'_I_ can't see anything,' said Anthea, 'my eye tickles so.'"|FALSE
836|"Then Jane's turn came, and she put her eye to the keyhole."|FALSE

836|"'It's no use sending the carpet to fetch precious things for youif you're afraid to look at them when they come,' said the Phoenix,sensibly. And Cyril, being the eldest, said--"|FALSE
836|"'Come on,' and turned the handle."|FALSE
836|"The gas had been left full on after tea, and everything in the roomcould be plainly seen by the ten eyes at the door. At least, noteverything, for though the carpet was there it was invisible, because itwas completely covered by the hundred and ninety-nine beautiful objectswhich it had brought from its birthplace."|FALSE
836|"'My hat!' Cyril remarked. 'I never thought about its being a PERSIANcarpet.'"|FALSE
836|"Yet it was now plain that it was so, for the beautiful objects which ithad brought back were cats--Persian cats, grey Persian cats, and therewere, as I have said, 199 of them, and they were sitting on the carpetas close as they could get to each other. But the moment the childrenentered the room the cats rose and stretched, and spread and overflowedfrom the carpet to the floor, and in an instant the floor was a sea ofmoving, mewing pussishness, and the children with one accord climbed tothe table, and gathered up their legs, and the people next door knockedon the wall--and, indeed, no wonder, for the mews were Persian andpiercing."|FALSE
836|"'This is pretty poor sport,' said Cyril. 'What's the matter with thebounders?'"|FALSE
836|"'I imagine that they are hungry,' said the Phoenix. 'If you were to feedthem--'"|FALSE
836|"'We haven't anything to feed them with,' said Anthea in despair, and shestroked the nearest Persian back. 'Oh, pussies, do be quiet--we can'thear ourselves think.'"|FALSE

836|"'Let's ask the carpet to take them away,' said Robert. But the girlssaid 'No.'"|FALSE
836|"'They are so soft and pussy,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'And valuable,' said Anthea, hastily. 'We can sell them for lots andlots of money.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why not send the carpet to get food for them?' suggested the Phoenix,and its golden voice came harsh and cracked with the effort it had to bemake to be heard above the increasing fierceness of the Persian mews."|FALSE
836|"So it was written that the carpet should bring food for 199 Persiancats, and the paper was pinned to the carpet as before."|FALSE
836|"The carpet seemed to gather itself together, and the cats dropped offit, as raindrops do from your mackintosh when you shake it. And thecarpet disappeared."|FALSE
836|"Unless you have had one-hundred and ninety-nine well-grown Persian catsin one small room, all hungry, and all saying so in unmistakable mews,you can form but a poor idea of the noise that now deafened the childrenand the Phoenix. The cats did not seem to have been at all properlybrought up. They seemed to have no idea of its being a mistake inmanners to ask for meals in a strange house--let alone to howl forthem--and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed,till the children poked their fingers into their ears and waited insilent agony, wondering why the whole of Camden Town did not comeknocking at the door to ask what was the matter, and only hoping thatthe food for the cats would come before the neighbours did--and beforeall the secret of the carpet and the Phoenix had to be given away beyondrecall to an indignant neighbourhood."|FALSE
836|"The cats mewed and mewed and twisted their Persian forms in and out andunfolded their Persian tails, and the children and the Phoenix huddledtogether on the table."|FALSE

836|"'Creep in,' cried Robert, opening his jacket."|FALSE
836|"And the Phoenix crept in--only just in time, for green eyes had glared,pink noses had sniffed, white whiskers had twitched, and as Robertbuttoned his coat he disappeared to the waist in a wave of eager greyPersian fur.

836|"'They can't understand English,' said Jane. 'You forget they're Persiancats, Panther.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said Anthea, rather sharply, for she was tired and anxious, 'whotold you \"milk\" wasn't Persian for milk. Lots of English words arejust the same in French--at least I know \"miaw\" is, and \"croquet\", and\"fiance\". Oh, pussies, do be quiet! Let's stroke them as hard as we canwith both hands, and perhaps they'll stop.'"|FALSE
836|"So every one stroked grey fur till their hands were tired, and as soonas a cat had been stroked enough to make it stop mewing it was pushedgently away, and another mewing mouser was approached by the hands ofthe strokers. And the noise was really more than half purr when thecarpet suddenly appeared in its proper place, and on it, instead of rowsof milk-cans, or even of milk-jugs, there was a COW. Not a Persian cow,either, nor, most fortunately, a musk-cow, if there is such a thing, buta smooth, sleek, dun-coloured Jersey cow, who blinked large soft eyes atthe gas-light and mooed in an amiable if rather inquiring manner."|FALSE

836|"'Anyway, it can't run after me,' she said to herself 'There isn't roomfor it even to begin to run.'"|FALSE
836|"The cow was perfectly placid. She behaved like a strayed duchess tillsome one brought a saucer for the milk, and some one else tried to milkthe cow into it. Milking is very difficult. You may think it is easy,but it is not. All the children were by this time strung up to a pitchof heroism that would have been impossible to them in their ordinarycondition. Robert and Cyril held the cow by the horns; and Jane, whenshe was quite sure that their end of the cow was quite secure, consentedto stand by, ready to hold the cow by the tail should occasion arise.Anthea, holding the saucer, now advanced towards the cow. She rememberedto have heard that cows, when milked by strangers, are susceptible tothe soothing influence of the human voice. So, clutching her saucer verytight, she sought for words to whose soothing influence the cow might besusceptible. And her memory, troubled by the events of the night, whichseemed to go on and on for ever and ever, refused to help her with anyform of words suitable to address a Jersey cow in."|FALSE
836|"'Poor pussy, then. Lie down, then, good dog, lie down!' was all that shecould think of to say, and she said it."|FALSE
836|"And nobody laughed. The situation, full of grey mewing cats, was tooserious for that. Then Anthea, with a beating heart, tried to milk thecow. Next moment the cow had knocked the saucer out of her hand andtrampled on it with one foot, while with the other three she had walkedon a foot each of Robert, Cyril, and Jane."|FALSE
836|"Jane burst into tears. 'Oh, how much too horrid everything is!' shecried. 'Come away. Let's go to bed and leave the horrid cats with thehateful cow. Perhaps somebody will eat somebody else. And serve themright.'"|FALSE
836|"They did not go to bed, but they had a shivering council in thedrawing-room, which smelt of soot--and, indeed, a heap of this lay inthe fender. There had been no fire in the room since mother wentaway, and all the chairs and tables were in the wrong places, and thechrysanthemums were dead, and the water in the pot nearly dried up.Anthea wrapped the embroidered woolly sofa blanket round Jane andherself, while Robert and Cyril had a struggle, silent and brief, butfierce, for the larger share of the fur hearthrug."|FALSE
836|"'It is most truly awful,' said Anthea, 'and I am so tired. Let's let thecats loose.'"|FALSE
836|"'And the cow, perhaps?' said Cyril. 'The police would find us at once.That cow would stand at the gate and mew--I mean moo--to come in. And sowould the cats. No; I see quite well what we've got to do. We mustput them in baskets and leave them on people's doorsteps, like orphanfoundlings.'"|FALSE
836|"'We've got three baskets, counting mother's work one,' said Janebrightening."|FALSE
836|"'And there are nearly two hundred cats,' said Anthea, 'besides thecow--and it would have to be a different-sized basket for her; and thenI don't know how you'd carry it, and you'd never find a doorstep bigenough to put it on. Except the church one--and--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, well,' said Cyril, 'if you simply MAKE difficulties--'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm with you,' said Robert. 'Don't fuss about the cow, Panther. It'ssimply GOT to stay the night, and I'm sure I've read that the cow is aremunerating creature, and that means it will sit still and thinkfor hours. The carpet can take it away in the morning. And as for thebaskets, we'll do them up in dusters, or pillow-cases, or bath-towels.Come on, Squirrel. You girls can be out of it if you like.'"|FALSE
836|"His tone was full of contempt, but Jane and Anthea were too tired anddesperate to care; even being 'out of it', which at other times theycould not have borne, now seemed quite a comfort. They snuggled down inthe sofa blanket, and Cyril threw the fur hearthrug over them."|FALSE

836|"'I'm not,' said Anthea, 'you know I'm not.' But Cyril was gone."|FALSE
836|"It was warm under the blanket and the hearthrug, and Jane snuggled upclose to her sister; and Anthea cuddled Jane closely and kindly, and ina sort of dream they heard the rise of a wave of mewing as Robert openedthe door of the nursery. They heard the booted search for baskets inthe back kitchen. They heard the side door open and close, and theyknew that each brother had gone out with at least one cat. Anthea'slast thought was that it would take at least all night to get rid ofone hundred and ninety-nine cats by twos. There would be ninety-ninejourneys of two cats each, and one cat over."|FALSE
836|"'I almost think we might keep the one cat over,' said Anthea. 'I don'tseem to care for cats just now, but I daresay I shall again some day.'And she fell asleep. Jane also was sleeping."|FALSE
836|"It was Jane who awoke with a start, to find Anthea still asleep. As, inthe act of awakening, she kicked her sister, she wondered idly whythey should have gone to bed in their boots; but the next moment sheremembered where they were."|FALSE
836|"There was a sound of muffled, shuffled feet on the stairs. Like theheroine of the classic poem, Jane 'thought it was the boys', and asshe felt quite wide awake, and not nearly so tired as before, she creptgently from Anthea's side and followed the footsteps. They went downinto the basement; the cats, who seemed to have fallen into the sleepof exhaustion, awoke at the sound of the approaching footsteps and mewedpiteously. Jane was at the foot of the stairs before she saw it was nother brothers whose coming had roused her and the cats, but a burglar.She knew he was a burglar at once, because he wore a fur cap and a redand black charity-check comforter, and he had no business where he was."|FALSE
836|"If you had been stood in jane's shoes you would no doubt have run awayin them, appealing to the police and neighbours with horrid screams. ButJane knew better. She had read a great many nice stories about burglars,as well as some affecting pieces of poetry, and she knew that no burglarwill ever hurt a little girl if he meets her when burgling. Indeed, inall the cases Jane had read of, his burglarishness was almost at onceforgotten in the interest he felt in the little girl's artless prattle.So if Jane hesitated for a moment before addressing the burglar, itwas only because she could not at once think of any remark sufficientlyprattling and artless to make a beginning with. In the stories and theaffecting poetry the child could never speak plainly, though it alwayslooked old enough to in the pictures. And Jane could not make up hermind to lisp and 'talk baby', even to a burglar. And while she hesitatedhe softly opened the nursery door and went in."|FALSE
836|"Jane followed--just in time to see him sit down flat on the floor,scattering cats as a stone thrown into a pool splashes water."|FALSE
836|"She closed the door softly and stood there, still wondering whether sheCOULD bring herself to say, 'What's 'oo doing here, Mithter Wobber?' andwhether any other kind of talk would do."|FALSE

836|"The cow turned and looked at him."|FALSE
836|"'SHE'S all right,' he went on. 'Sort of company, too. Though them aboveknows how she got into this downstairs parlour. But them cats--oh, take'em away, take 'em away! I'll chuck the 'ole show--Oh, take 'em away.'"|FALSE
836|"'Burglar,' said Jane, close behind him, and he started convulsively,and turned on her a blank face, whose pale lips trembled. 'I can't takethose cats away.'"|FALSE

836|"'I am quite real,' said Jane, relieved to find that a lisp was notneeded to make the burglar understand her. 'And so,' she added, 'are thecats.'"|FALSE
836|"'Then send for the police, send for the police, and I'll go quiet. Ifyou ain't no realler than them cats, I'm done, spunchuck--out of time.Send for the police. I'll go quiet. One thing, there'd not be room for'arf them cats in no cell as ever _I_ see.'"|FALSE
836|"He ran his fingers through his hair, which was short, and his eyeswandered wildly round the roomful of cats."|FALSE

836|"'Send for the police,' was the unfortunate criminal's only reply. 'I'drather you would--honest, I'd rather.'"|FALSE
836|"'I daren't,' said Jane, 'and besides, I've no one to send. I hate thepolice. I wish he'd never been born.'"|FALSE

836|"'Wish I may die if she ain't the very spit of her,' replied the man."|FALSE
836|"'Well, then,' said Jane--and a thrill of joyful pride ran throughher--'perhaps you know how to milk cows?'"|FALSE

If it hadn't been for me throwing the two bags of cat slap inhis eye and hauling Robert over a railing, and lying like mice undera laurel-bush--Well, it's jolly lucky I'm a good shot, that's all.He pranced off when he'd got the cat-bags off his face--thought we'dbolted. And here we are.'"|FALSE
836|"The gentle samishness of the milk swishing into the hand-bowl seemedto have soothed the burglar very much.

836|"'It makes me think of old times,' said the burglar, smearing his raggedcoat-cuff across his eyes--'about the apples in the orchard at home,and the rats at threshing time, and the rabbits and the ferrets, and howpretty it was seeing the pigs killed.'"|FALSE

They heard thecook say it was a judgement on them for leaving the place to itself;she seemed to think that a booby trap was a kind of plant that was quitelikely to grow, all by itself, in a dwelling that was left shut up.

It has reposed in the sandal-wood caskets ofprincesses, and in the rose-attar-scented treasure-houses of kings.Never, never, had any one degraded it by walking on it--except in theway of business, when wishes were required, and then they always tooktheir shoes off.

836|"'Well, then, we went out, and down by where the undertaker's is, withthe china flowers in the window--you know. There was a crowd, and ofcourse we went to have a squint.

So they wereready for anything, and they stood on the carpet and said--"|FALSE

836|"I think every one had expected the cell to be the 'deepest dungeon belowthe castle moat'. I am sure no one had doubted that the burglar, chainedby heavy fetters to a ring in the damp stone wall, would be tossinguneasily on a bed of straw, with a pitcher of water and a moulderingcrust, untasted, beside him. Robert, remembering the underground passageand the treasure, had brought a candle and matches, but these were notneeded."|FALSE

The carpet disappeared, and more quickly than youwould have thought possible it came back, bearing on its bosom theReverend Septimus Blenkinsop."|FALSE
836|"The Reverend Septimus was rather a nice young man, but very much mazedand muddled, because when he saw a strange carpet laid out at his feet,in his own study, he naturally walked on it to examine it more closely.And he happened to stand on one of the thin places that Jane and Antheahad darned, so that he was half on wishing carpet and half on plainScotch heather-mixture fingering, which has no magic properties at all."|FALSE
836|"The effect of this was that he was only half there--so that the childrencould just see through him, as though he had been a ghost.

836|"He seemed to himself to be in a sort of insane fit, so that it did notmatter what he did--and he married the burglar to the cook.

836|"And of course the clergyman, though misty, was really real, and ableto marry people, and he did. When the ceremony was over the clergymanwandered about the island collecting botanical specimens, for he was agreat botanist, and the ruling passion was strong even in an insane fit."|FALSE

836|"As for the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop, he felt that he had had avery insane fit indeed, and he was sure it was due to over-study. So heplanned a little dissipation, and took his two maiden aunts to Paris,where they enjoyed a dazzling round of museums and picture galleries,and came back feeling that they had indeed seen life.

836|"'Yes, there's that,' said Cyril, recovering himself. 'They'll be allright. They'll howl till some one gets them down, or drop tiles intothe front garden to attract attention of passersby. Bobs has got myone-and-fivepence--lucky you forgot to mend that hole in my pocket,Panther, or he wouldn't have had it. They can tram it home.'"|FALSE
836|"But Anthea would not be comforted."|FALSE
836|"'It's all my fault,' she said. 'I KNEW the proper way to darn, and Ididn't do it. It's all my fault. Let's go home and patch the carpet withyour Etons--something really strong--and send it to fetch them.'"|FALSE
836|"'All right,' said Cyril; 'but your Sunday jacket is stronger than myEtons. We must just chuck mother's present, that's all. I wish--'"|FALSE
836|"'Stop!' cried the Phoenix; 'the carpet is dropping to earth.'"|FALSE
836|"And indeed it was."|FALSE
836|"It sank swiftly, yet steadily, and landed on the pavement of theDeptford Road. It tipped a little as it landed, so that Cyril and Antheanaturally walked off it, and in an instant it had rolled itself up andhidden behind a gate-post. It did this so quickly that not a singleperson in the Deptford Road noticed it. The Phoenix rustled its way intothe breast of Cyril's coat, and almost at the same moment a well-knownvoice remarked--"|FALSE
836|"'Well, I never! What on earth are you doing here?'"|FALSE
836|"They were face to face with their pet uncle--their Uncle Reginald."|FALSE
836|"'We DID think of going to Greenwich Palace and talking about Nelson,'said Cyril, telling as much of the truth as he thought his uncle couldbelieve."|FALSE
836|"'And where are the others?' asked Uncle Reginald."|FALSE
836|"'I don't exactly know,' Cyril replied, this time quite truthfully."|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said Uncle Reginald, 'I must fly. I've a case in the CountyCourt. That's the worst of being a beastly solicitor. One can't take thechances of life when one gets them.

836|"They unrolled the carpet quickly and slyly--they did not want to attractpublic attention--and the moment their feet were on the carpet Antheawished to be at home, and instantly they were."|FALSE
836|"The kindness of their excellent uncle had made it unnecessary for themto go to such extremes as Cyril's Etons or Anthea's Sunday jacket forthe patching of the carpet."|FALSE
836|"Anthea set to work at once to draw the edges of the broken darntogether, and Cyril hastily went out and bought a large piece of themarble-patterned American oil-cloth which careful house-wives use tocover dressers and kitchen tables. It was the strongest thing he couldthink of."|FALSE
836|"Then they set to work to line the carpet throughout with the oil-cloth.The nursery felt very odd and empty without the others, and Cyril didnot feel so sure as he had done about their being able to 'tram it'home.

836|"'Oh, how awful!' whispered Jane. 'We shall never get away alive.'"|FALSE
836|"'Hush!' said Robert, not a moment too soon, for there were steps on thestairs, and next instant the two ladies came into the room. They did notsee the children, but they saw the empty missionary box."|FALSE

836|"'I don't know,' said the Reverend Septimus; 'it's a difficult problem.It is such a very unusual dream. Perhaps it's only a sort of otherlife--quite real enough for you to be mad in. And if you're mad, theremight be a dream-asylum where you'd be kindly treated, and in timerestored, cured, to your sorrowing relatives. It is very hard to seeyour duty plainly, even in ordinary life, and these dream-circumstancesare so complicated--'"|FALSE
836|"'If it's a dream,' said Robert, 'you will wake up directly, and thenyou'd be sorry if you'd sent us into a dream-asylum, because you mightnever get into the same dream again and let us out, and so we might staythere for ever, and then what about our sorrowing relatives who aren'tin the dreams at all?'"|FALSE
836|"But all the curate could now say was, 'Oh, my head!'"|FALSE
836|"And Jane and Robert felt quite ill with helplessness and hopelessness. Areally conscientious curate is a very difficult thing to manage."|FALSE

836|"'Oh, if it's only _I_,' he said; 'if we'd all dreamed it I could neverhave believed it, never!'"|FALSE
836|"Afterwards Aunt Selina said to the other aunt--"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, I know it was an untruth, and I shall doubtless be punished for itin due course. But I could see the poor dear fellow's brain giving waybefore my very eyes. He couldn't have stood the strain of three dreams.It WAS odd, wasn't it? All three of us dreaming the same thing at thesame moment. We must never tell dear Seppy. But I shall send an accountof it to the Psychical Society, with stars instead of names, you know.'"|FALSE

836|"When the joyful emotions of reunion had calmed down a little, theyall went out and spent what was left of Uncle Reginald's sovereign inpresents for mother.

Also they bought acake with icing on, and the rest of the money they spent on flowers toput in the vases."|FALSE

836|"'It's not our fault, mother, is it, that our boots are the reallyreliable kind?' Robert asked the question more in sorrow than in anger."|FALSE
836|"'No, dear, we can't help our boots,' said mother, cheerfully, 'but wemight change them when we come in, perhaps. It's just an idea of mine.I wouldn't dream of scolding on the very first morning after I've comehome. Oh, my Lamb, how could you?'"|FALSE
836|"This conversation was at breakfast, and the Lamb had been beautifullygood until every one was looking at the carpet, and then it was for himbut the work of a moment to turn a glass dish of syrupy blackberry jamupside down on his young head. It was the work of a good many minutesand several persons to get the jam off him again, and this interestingwork took people's minds off the carpet, and nothing more was said justthen about its badness as a bargain and about what mother hoped for fromcoconut matting."|FALSE
836|"When the Lamb was clean again he had to be taken care of while motherrumpled her hair and inked her fingers and made her head ache over thedifficult and twisted house-keeping accounts which cook gave her ondirty bits of paper, and which were supposed to explain how it was thatcook had only fivepence-half-penny and a lot of unpaid bills left outof all the money mother had sent her for house-keeping. Mother was veryclever, but even she could not quite understand the cook's accounts."|FALSE
836|"The Lamb was very glad to have his brothers and sisters to play withhim. He had not forgotten them a bit, and he made them play all the oldexhausting games: 'Whirling Worlds', where you swing the baby round andround by his hands; and 'Leg and Wing', where you swing him from sideto side by one ankle and one wrist. There was also climbing Vesuvius.In this game the baby walks up you, and when he is standing on yourshoulders, you shout as loud as you can, which is the rumbling of theburning mountain, and then tumble him gently on to the floor, and rollhim there, which is the destruction of Pompeii."|FALSE

836|"'I don't think you'd care about the sons of the Phoenix, really,' saidRobert. 'I have heard that they don't do anything fiery. They only drinka great deal. Much more than other people, because they drink lemonadeand fizzy things, and the more you drink of those the more good youget.'"|FALSE
836|"'In your mind, perhaps,' said Jane; 'but it wouldn't be good in yourbody. You'd get too balloony.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix yawned."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Anthea; 'I really have an idea. This isn't like acommon carpet. It's very magic indeed. Don't you think, if we put Tatchoon it, and then gave it a rest, the magic part of it might grow, likehair is supposed to do?'"|FALSE
836|"'It might,' said Robert; 'but I should think paraffin would do aswell--at any rate as far as the smell goes, and that seems to be thegreat thing about Tatcho.'"|FALSE
836|"But with all its faults Anthea's idea was something to do, and they didit."|FALSE
836|"It was Cyril who fetched the Tatcho bottle from father's washhand-stand.But the bottle had not much in it."|FALSE
836|"'We mustn't take it all,' Jane said, 'in case father's hair began tocome off suddenly. If he hadn't anything to put on it, it might alldrop off before Eliza had time to get round to the chemist's for anotherbottle. It would be dreadful to have a bald father, and it would all beour fault.'"|FALSE
836|"'And wigs are very expensive, I believe,' said Anthea. 'Look here, leaveenough in the bottle to wet father's head all over with in case anyemergency emerges--and let's make up with paraffin. I expect it's thesmell that does the good really--and the smell's exactly the same.'"|FALSE
836|"So a small teaspoonful of the Tatcho was put on the edges of the worstdarn in the carpet and rubbed carefully into the roots of the hairs ofit, and all the parts that there was not enough Tatcho for had paraffinrubbed into them with a piece of flannel. Then the flannel was burned.It made a gay flame, which delighted the Phoenix and the Lamb."|FALSE

836|"'We have burnt a paraffiny rag,' Anthea answered."|FALSE

836|"'That means,' said mother, 'that you're going to see \"The Water Babies\"all by your happy selves, and father and I will take you and fetch you.Give me the Lamb, dear, and you and Jane put clean lace in your redevening frocks, and I shouldn't wonder if you found they wanted ironing.This paraffin smell is ghastly. Run and get out your frocks.'"|FALSE
836|"The frocks did want ironing--wanted it rather badly, as it happened;for, being of tomato-Coloured Liberty silk, they had been found veryuseful for tableaux vivants when a red dress was required for CardinalRichelieu. They were very nice tableaux, these, and I wish I could tellyou about them; but one cannot tell everything in a story. You wouldhave been specially interested in hearing about the tableau of thePrinces in the Tower, when one of the pillows burst, and the youthfulPrinces were so covered with feathers that the picture might very wellhave been called 'Michaelmas Eve; or, Plucking the Geese'."|FALSE

836|"'Why, you've hardly been hatched any time at all.'"|FALSE
836|"'Time,' remarked the Phoenix, 'is measured by heartbeats. I'm sure thepalpitations I've had since I've known you are enough to blanch thefeathers of any bird.'"|FALSE
836|"'But I thought you lived 500 years,' said Robert, and you've hardlybegun this set of years. Think of all the time that's before you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Time,' said the Phoenix, 'is, as you are probably aware, merely aconvenient fiction. There is no such thing as time. I have lived inthese two months at a pace which generously counterbalances 500 years oflife in the desert. I am old, I am weary. I feel as if I ought to lay myegg, and lay me down to my fiery sleep. But unless I'm careful I shallbe hatched again instantly, and that is a misfortune which I reallydo not think I COULD endure. But do not let me intrude these desperatepersonal reflections on your youthful happiness. What is the show at thetheatre to-night? Wrestlers? Gladiators? A combat of cameleopards andunicorns?'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't think so,' said Cyril; 'it's called \"The Water Babies\", andif it's like the book there isn't any gladiating in it. There arechimney-sweeps and professors, and a lobster and an otter and a salmon,and children living in the water.'"|FALSE
836|"'It sounds chilly.' The Phoenix shivered, and went to sit on the tongs."|FALSE
836|"'I don't suppose there will be REAL water,' said Jane. 'And theatres arevery warm and pretty, with a lot of gold and lamps. Wouldn't you like tocome with us?'"|FALSE
836|"'_I_ was just going to say that,' said Robert, in injured tones, 'onlyI know how rude it is to interrupt. Do come, Phoenix, old chap; it willcheer you up. It'll make you laugh like any thing. Mr Bourchier alwaysmakes ripping plays. You ought to have seen \"Shock-headed Peter\" lastyear.'"|FALSE
836|"'Your words are strange,' said the Phoenix, 'but I will come with you.The revels of this Bourchier, of whom you speak, may help me to forgetthe weight of my years.' So that evening the Phoenix snugged inside thewaistcoat of Robert's Etons--a very tight fit it seemed both to Robertand to the Phoenix--and was taken to the play."|FALSE
836|"Robert had to pretend to be cold at the glittering, many-mirroredrestaurant where they ate dinner, with father in evening dress, witha very shiny white shirt-front, and mother looking lovely in her greyevening dress, that changes into pink and green when she moves. Robertpretended that he was too cold to take off his great-coat, and so satsweltering through what would otherwise have been a most thrilling meal.He felt that he was a blot on the smart beauty of the family, and hehoped the Phoenix knew what he was suffering for its sake. Of course,we are all pleased to suffer for the sake of others, but we like themto know it unless we are the very best and noblest kind of people, andRobert was just ordinary."|FALSE
836|"Father was full of jokes and fun, and every one laughed all the time,even with their mouths full, which is not manners. Robert thought fatherwould not have been quite so funny about his keeping his over-coat on iffather had known all the truth. And there Robert was probably right."|FALSE
836|"When dinner was finished to the last grape and the last paddle in thefinger glasses--for it was a really truly grown-up dinner--the childrenwere taken to the theatre, guided to a box close to the stage, and left."|FALSE
836|"Father's parting words were: 'Now, don't you stir out of this box,whatever you do. I shall be back before the end of the play. Be goodand you will be happy. Is this zone torrid enough for the abandonment ofgreat-coats, Bobs? No? Well, then, I should say you were sickening forsomething--mumps or measles or thrush or teething. Goodbye.'"|FALSE
836|"He went, and Robert was at last able to remove his coat, mop hisperspiring brow, and release the crushed and dishevelled Phoenix. Roberthad to arrange his damp hair at the looking-glass at the back of thebox, and the Phoenix had to preen its disordered feathers for some timebefore either of them was fit to be seen."|FALSE
836|"They were very, very early. When the lights went up fully, the Phoenix,balancing itself on the gilded back of a chair, swayed in ecstasy."|FALSE
836|"'How fair a scene is this!' it murmured; 'how far fairer than my temple!Or have I guessed aright? Have you brought me hither to lift up my heartwith emotions of joyous surprise? Tell me, my Robert, is it not thatthis, THIS is my true temple, and the other was but a humble shrinefrequented by outcasts?'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't know about outcasts,' said Robert, 'but you can call this yourtemple if you like. Hush! the music is beginning.'"|FALSE
836|"I am not going to tell you about the play. As I said before, one can'ttell everything, and no doubt you saw 'The Water Babies' yourselves. Ifyou did not it was a shame, or, rather, a pity."|FALSE
836|"What I must tell you is that, though Cyril and Jane and Robert andAnthea enjoyed it as much as any children possibly could, the pleasureof the Phoenix was far, far greater than theirs."|FALSE
836|"'This is indeed my temple,' it said again and again. 'What radiantrites! And all to do honour to me!'"|FALSE
836|"The songs in the play it took to be hymns in its honour. The choruseswere choric songs in its praise. The electric lights, it said, weremagic torches lighted for its sake, and it was so charmed with thefootlights that the children could hardly persuade it to sit still. Butwhen the limelight was shown it could contain its approval no longer. Itflapped its golden wings, and cried in a voice that could be heard allover the theatre:"|FALSE
836|"'Well done, my servants! Ye have my favour and my countenance!'"|FALSE
836|"Little Tom on the stage stopped short in what he was saying. A deepbreath was drawn by hundreds of lungs, every eye in the house turned tothe box where the luckless children cringed, and most people hissed, orsaid 'Shish!' or 'Turn them out!'"|FALSE

836|"So now the Phoenix was quiet, but it kept whispering to the children. Itwanted to know why there was no altar, no fire, no incense, and becameso excited and fretful and tiresome that four at least of the party offive wished deeply that it had been left at home."|FALSE
836|"What happened next was entirely the fault of the Phoenix. It was notin the least the fault of the theatre people, and no one could everunderstand afterwards how it did happen. No one, that is, except theguilty bird itself and the four children. The Phoenix was balancingitself on the gilt back of the chair, swaying backwards and forwards andup and down, as you may see your own domestic parrot do. I mean the greyone with the red tail. All eyes were on the stage, where the lobsterwas delighting the audience with that gem of a song, 'If you can't walkstraight, walk sideways!' when the Phoenix murmured warmly--"|FALSE

836|"It seemed to have made but one circular wing-sweep, such as you may seea gull make over grey water on a stormy day. Next moment it was perchedagain on the chair-back--and all round the theatre, where it had passed,little sparks shone like tinsel seeds, then little smoke wreaths curledup like growing plants--little flames opened like flower-buds. Peoplewhispered--then people shrieked."|FALSE
836|"'Fire! Fire!' The curtain went down--the lights went up."|FALSE
836|"'Fire!' cried every one, and made for the doors."|FALSE

836|"A sudden jet of flame stopped its words. Alas! the Phoenix hadunconsciously warmed to its subject, and in the unintentional heat ofthe moment had set fire to the paraffin with which that morning thechildren had anointed the carpet. It burned merrily. The children triedin vain to stamp it out. They had to stand back and let it burn itselfout. When the paraffin had burned away it was found that it had takenwith it all the darns of Scotch heather-mixture fingering. Only thefabric of the old carpet was left--and that was full of holes."|FALSE
836|"'Come,' said the Phoenix, 'I'm cool now.'"|FALSE

836|"'Home!' said Cyril, and instantly the cool draught from under thenursery door played upon their legs as they sat.

836|"It flew out."|FALSE

836|"The children spread out what was left of the carpet. And, after all,though this was just what they would have wished to have happened, allhearts were sad. Then they put half a scuttle of coal on the fire andwent out, closing the door on the Phoenix--left, at last, alone with thecarpet."|FALSE
836|"'One of us must keep watch,' said Robert, excitedly, as soon as theywere all out of the room, 'and the others can go and buy sweet woods andspices. Get the very best that money can buy, and plenty of them.Don't let's stand to a threepence or so. I want it to have a jolly goodsend-off. It's the only thing that'll make us feel less horrid inside.'"|FALSE

836|"So they left Cyril, standing like a Roman sentinel outside the doorinside which the Phoenix was getting ready for the great change, andthey all went out to buy the precious things for the last sad rites."|FALSE
836|"'Robert is right,' Anthea said; 'this is no time for being careful aboutour money. Let's go to the stationer's first, and buy a whole packet oflead-pencils. They're cheaper if you buy them by the packet.'"|FALSE
836|"This was a thing that they had always wanted to do, but it needed thegreat excitement of a funeral pyre and a parting from a beloved Phoenixto screw them up to the extravagance."|FALSE
836|"The people at the stationer's said that the pencils were realcedar-wood, so I hope they were, for stationers should always speakthe truth. At any rate they cost one-and-fourpence. Also they spentsevenpence three-farthings on a little sandal-wood box inlaid withivory."|FALSE
836|"'Because,' said Anthea, 'I know sandalwood smells sweet, and when it'sburned it smells very sweet indeed.'"|FALSE
836|"'Ivory doesn't smell at all,' said Robert, 'but I expect when you burnit it smells most awful vile, like bones.'"|FALSE
836|"At the grocer's they bought all the spices they could remember the namesof--shell-like mace, cloves like blunt nails, peppercorns, the longand the round kind; ginger, the dry sort, of course; and the beautifulbloom-covered shells of fragrant cinnamon. Allspice too, and carawayseeds (caraway seeds that smelt most deadly when the time came forburning them)."|FALSE
836|"Camphor and oil of lavender were bought at the chemist's, and also alittle scent sachet labelled 'Violettes de Parme'."|FALSE
836|"They took the things home and found Cyril still on guard. When they hadknocked and the golden voice of the Phoenix had said 'Come in,' theywent in."|FALSE
836|"There lay the carpet--or what was left of it--and on it lay an egg,exactly like the one out of which the Phoenix had been hatched."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix was walking round and round the egg, clucking with joy andpride."|FALSE
836|"'I've laid it, you see,' it said, 'and as fine an egg as ever I laid inall my born days.'"|FALSE
836|"Every one said yes, it was indeed a beauty."|FALSE
836|"The things which the children had bought were now taken out of theirpapers and arranged on the table, and when the Phoenix had beenpersuaded to leave its egg for a moment and look at the materials forits last fire it was quite overcome."|FALSE
836|"'Never, never have I had a finer pyre than this will be. You shall notregret it,' it said, wiping away a golden tear. 'Write quickly: \"Go andtell the Psammead to fulfil the last wish of the Phoenix, and returninstantly\".'"|FALSE
836|"But Robert wished to be polite and he wrote--"|FALSE
836|"'Please go and ask the Psammead to be so kind as to fulfil the Phoenix'slast wish, and come straight back, if you please.' The paper was pinnedto the carpet, which vanished and returned in the flash of an eye."|FALSE
836|"Then another paper was written ordering the carpet to take the eggsomewhere where it wouldn't be hatched for another two thousand years.The Phoenix tore itself away from its cherished egg, which it watchedwith yearning tenderness till, the paper being pinned on, the carpethastily rolled itself up round the egg, and both vanished for ever fromthe nursery of the house in Camden Town."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!' said everybody."|FALSE
836|"'Bear up,' said the bird; 'do you think _I_ don't suffer, being partedfrom my precious new-laid egg like this? Come, conquer your emotions andbuild my fire.'"|FALSE
836|"'OH!' cried Robert, suddenly, and wholly breaking down, 'I can't BEARyou to go!'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix perched on his shoulder and rubbed its beak softly againsthis ear."|FALSE
836|"'The sorrows of youth soon appear but as dreams,' it said. 'Farewell,Robert of my heart. I have loved you well.'"|FALSE
836|"The fire had burnt to a red glow. One by one the spices and sweet woodswere laid on it. Some smelt nice and some--the caraway seeds and theViolettes de Parme sachet among them--smelt worse than you would thinkpossible."|FALSE
836|"'Farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell!' said the Phoenix, in afar-away voice."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, GOOD-BYE,' said every one, and now all were in tears."|FALSE
836|"The bright bird fluttered seven times round the room and settled in thehot heart of the fire. The sweet gums and spices and woods flared andflickered around it, but its golden feathers did not burn. It seemed togrow red-hot to the very inside heart of it--and then before the eighteyes of its friends it fell together, a heap of white ashes, and theflames of the cedar pencils and the sandal-wood box met and joined aboveit."|FALSE
836|"'Whatever have you done with the carpet?' asked mother next day."|FALSE

836|"But that very night a great box came, addressed to the children by alltheir names. Eliza never could remember the name of the carrier whobrought it. It wasn't Carter Paterson or the Parcels Delivery."|FALSE
836|"It was instantly opened. It was a big wooden box, and it had tobe opened with a hammer and the kitchen poker; the long nails camesqueaking out, and boards scrunched as they were wrenched off. Insidethe box was soft paper, with beautiful Chinese patterns on it--blue andgreen and red and violet. And under the paper--well, almost everythinglovely that you can think of. Everything of reasonable size, I mean;for, of course, there were no motors or flying machines or thoroughbredchargers. But there really was almost everything else. Everything thatthe children had always wanted--toys and games and books, and chocolateand candied cherries and paint-boxes and photographic cameras, and allthe presents they had always wanted to give to father and mother and theLamb, only they had never had the money for them. At the very bottomof the box was a tiny golden feather. No one saw it but Robert, and hepicked it up and hid it in the breast of his jacket, which had beenso often the nesting-place of the golden bird. When he went to bed thefeather was gone. It was the last he ever saw of the Phoenix."|FALSE
