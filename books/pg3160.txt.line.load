3160|"INTRODUCTION"|FALSE
3160|"Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of"|FALSE
3160|"scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the"|FALSE
3160|"most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very"|FALSE
3160|"gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and"|FALSE
3160|"emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set"|FALSE
3160|"aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must"|FALSE
3160|"be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour"|FALSE
3160|"and anxiety to acquire."|FALSE
3160|"And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which"|FALSE
3160|"progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which"|FALSE
3160|"persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu"|FALSE
3160|"of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept"|FALSE
3160|"away traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the"|FALSE
3160|"revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from"|FALSE
3160|"attractive superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in"|FALSE
3160|"society. The credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another,"|FALSE
3160|"finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the"|FALSE
3160|"healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams"|FALSE
3160|"of conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the"|FALSE
3160|"Church.  History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively"|FALSE
3160|"recent times, are subjected to very different handling from that"|FALSE
3160|"which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere"|FALSE
3160|"statements are jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form"|FALSE
3160|"as important an ingredient in the analysis or his history, as the"|FALSE
3160|"facts he records. Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and"|FALSE
3160|"it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical"|FALSE
3160|"evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting"|FALSE
3160|"in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than"|FALSE
3160|"mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an introduction of extended"|FALSE
3160|"experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history."|FALSE
3160|"Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which"|FALSE
3160|"human experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To"|FALSE
3160|"form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming"|FALSE
3160|"parts of a great whole--we must measure them by their relation to the"|FALSE
3160|"mass of beings by whom they are surrounded; and, in contemplating the"|FALSE
3160|"incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down"|FALSE
3160|"to us, we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole"|FALSE
3160|"narrative, than the respective probability of its details."|FALSE
3160|"It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know"|FALSE
3160|"least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere have, perhaps,"|FALSE
3160|"contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than"|FALSE
3160|"any other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of"|FALSE
3160|"all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which"|FALSE
3160|"has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or"|FALSE
3160|"theories we will follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps,"|FALSE
3160|"the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without"|FALSE
3160|"controversy; but upon everything else, even down to the authorship of"|FALSE
3160|"plays, there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we"|FALSE
3160|"know as little as the contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow"|FALSE
3160|"us to know. He was one of the dramatis personae in two dramas as"|FALSE
3160|"unlike in principles as in style. He appears as the enunciator of"|FALSE
3160|"opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have"|FALSE
3160|"handed them down. When we have read Plato or Xenophon, we think we"|FALSE
3160|"know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and examined"|FALSE
3160|"both, we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant."|FALSE
3160|"It has been an easy, and a popular expedient of late years, to deny"|FALSE
3160|"the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and"|FALSE
3160|"condition were too much for our belief. This system--which has often"|FALSE
3160|"comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of"|FALSE
3160|"Strauss for those of the New Testament--has been of incalculable"|FALSE
3160|"value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries."|FALSE
3160|"To question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more"|FALSE
3160|"excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact"|FALSE
3160|"related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory"|FALSE
3160|"developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in"|FALSE
3160|"the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured"|FALSE
3160|"old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized--Numa"|FALSE
3160|"Pompilius."|FALSE
3160|"Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,"|FALSE
3160|"and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free"|FALSE
3160|"permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all"|FALSE
3160|"written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and"|FALSE
3160|"Odyssey.  What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily"|FALSE
3160|"dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. \"This"|FALSE
3160|"cannot be true, because it is not true; and that is not true, because"|FALSE
3160|"it cannot be true.\" Such seems to be the style, in which testimony"|FALSE
3160|"upon testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and"|FALSE
3160|"oblivion."|FALSE
3160|"It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer"|FALSE
3160|"are partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in"|FALSE
3160|"which truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief"|FALSE
3160|"review of the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice"|FALSE
3160|"must be taken of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been"|FALSE
3160|"attributed to Herodotus."|FALSE
3160|"According to this document, the city of Cumae in AEolia was, at an"|FALSE
3160|"early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of"|FALSE
3160|"Greece.  Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes."|FALSE
3160|"Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl"|FALSE
3160|"named Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under"|FALSE
3160|"the guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of"|FALSE
3160|"this maiden that we \"are indebted for so much happiness.\" Homer was"|FALSE
3160|"the first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of"|FALSE
3160|"Melesigenes from having been born near the river Meles in Boeotia,"|FALSE
3160|"whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her"|FALSE
3160|"reputation."|FALSE
3160|"\"At this time,\" continues our narrative, \"there lived at Smyrna a man"|FALSE
3160|"named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being"|FALSE
3160|"married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax"|FALSE
3160|"he received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory"|FALSE
3160|"was her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he"|FALSE
3160|"made proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further"|FALSE
3160|"inducement, willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become"|FALSE
3160|"a clever man, if he were carefully brought up.\""|FALSE
3160|"They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which"|FALSE
3160|"nature had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows"|FALSE
3160|"in every attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in"|FALSE
3160|"wisdom. Phemius died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his"|FALSE
3160|"mother soon followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father's"|FALSE
3160|"school with great success, exciting the admiration not only of the"|FALSE
3160|"inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade"|FALSE
3160|"carried on there, especially in the exportation of corn, attracted to"|FALSE
3160|"that city. Among these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the"|FALSE
3160|"modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely"|FALSE
3160|"found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and"|FALSE
3160|"accompany him on his travels. He promised not only to pay his"|FALSE
3160|"expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that,"|FALSE
3160|"\"While he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his"|FALSE
3160|"own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the"|FALSE
3160|"subjects of his discourses.\" Melesigenes consented, and set out with"|FALSE
3160|"his patron, \"examining all the curiosities of the countries they"|FALSE
3160|"visited, and informing himself of everything by interrogating those"|FALSE
3160|"whom he met.\" We may also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that"|FALSE
3160|"he deemed worthy of preservation. Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and"|FALSE
3160|"Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already"|FALSE
3160|"suffered in his eyes, became much worse; and Mentes, who was about to"|FALSE
3160|"leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical superintendence of a"|FALSE
3160|"friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor. Under his hospitable"|FALSE
3160|"and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the"|FALSE
3160|"legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed the subject of"|FALSE
3160|"the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it was here that"|FALSE
3160|"Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophonians make their city the"|FALSE
3160|"seat of that misfortune.  He then returned to Smyrna, where he"|FALSE
3160|"applied himself to the study of poetry."|FALSE
3160|"But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean"|FALSE
3160|"plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae."|FALSE
3160|"Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of"|FALSE
3160|"one Tychias, an armourer. \"And up to my time,\" continues the author,"|FALSE
3160|"\"the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a"|FALSE
3160|"recitation of his verses; and they greatly honoured the spot. Here"|FALSE
3160|"also a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since"|FALSE
3160|"Melesigenes arrived.\""|FALSE
3160|"But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as"|FALSE
3160|"being the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an"|FALSE
3160|"epitaph on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with"|FALSE
3160|"greater probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus."|FALSE
3160|"Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the conversaziones of the old men,"|FALSE
3160|"and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this"|FALSE
3160|"favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a"|FALSE
3160|"public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously"|FALSE
3160|"renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure"|FALSE
3160|"he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made"|FALSE
3160|"the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to"|FALSE
3160|"acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the"|FALSE
3160|"answer to be given to his proposal."|FALSE
3160|"The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's"|FALSE
3160|"demand, but one man \"observed that if they were to feed Homers, they"|FALSE
3160|"would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.\" \"From this"|FALSE
3160|"circumstance,\" says the writer, \"Melesigenes acquired the name of"|FALSE
3160|"Homer, for the Cumans call blind men Homers.\" With a love of economy,"|FALSE
3160|"which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of"|FALSE
3160|"literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented his"|FALSE
3160|"disappointment in a wish that Cumae might never produce a poet"|FALSE
3160|"capable of giving it renown and glory."|FALSE
3160|"At Phocaea Homer was destined to experience another literary"|FALSE
3160|"distress.  One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical"|FALSE
3160|"genius, kept Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on"|FALSE
3160|"condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name. Having"|FALSE
3160|"collected sufficient poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some"|FALSE
3160|"would-be literary publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had"|FALSE
3160|"sucked, and left him.  At his departure, Homer is said to have"|FALSE
3160|"observed: \"O Thestorides, of the many things hidden from the"|FALSE
3160|"knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible than the human"|FALSE
3160|"heart.\""|FALSE
3160|"Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some"|FALSE
3160|"Chian merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard"|FALSE
3160|"him recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was"|FALSE
3160|"pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same"|FALSE
3160|"poems. This at once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel"|FALSE
3160|"happened then to be setting sail thither, but he found one ready to"|FALSE
3160|"start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he"|FALSE
3160|"prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having"|FALSE
3160|"embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he might be"|FALSE
3160|"able to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of"|FALSE
3160|"hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable."|FALSE
3160|"At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in"|FALSE
3160|"Phocaea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,"|FALSE
3160|"reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,"|FALSE
3160|"which we will continue in the words of our author. \"Having set out"|FALSE
3160|"from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that"|FALSE
3160|"were pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out."|FALSE
3160|"Glaucus (for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran"|FALSE
3160|"up quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For"|FALSE
3160|"some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such"|FALSE
3160|"a place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went"|FALSE
3160|"up to him and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate"|FALSE
3160|"places and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by"|FALSE
3160|"recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him"|FALSE
3160|"with compassion; and he took him and led him to his cot, and, having"|FALSE
3160|"lit a fire, bade him sup."|FALSE
3160|"\"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according"|FALSE
3160|"to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O"|FALSE
3160|"Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs"|FALSE
3160|"their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,"|FALSE
3160|"whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold."|FALSE
3160|"\"Glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author."|FALSE
3160|"Having finished supper, they banqueted afresh on conversation, Homer"|FALSE
3160|"narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited."|FALSE
3160|"\"At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning,"|FALSE
3160|"Glaucus resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his"|FALSE
3160|"meeting with Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a"|FALSE
3160|"fellow-servant, he left Homer at home, promising to return quickly."|FALSE
3160|"Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near the farm, and finding his"|FALSE
3160|"mate, he told him the whole story respecting Homer and his journey."|FALSE
3160|"He paid little attention to what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his"|FALSE
3160|"stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons."|FALSE
3160|"However, he bade him bring the stranger to him."|FALSE
3160|"\"Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,"|FALSE
3160|"assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon"|FALSE
3160|"showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general"|FALSE
3160|"knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake"|FALSE
3160|"the charge of his children.\""|FALSE
3160|"Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the"|FALSE
3160|"island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town"|FALSE
3160|"of Chios he established a school, where he taught the precepts of"|FALSE
3160|"poetry.  \"To this day,\" says Chandler, \"the most curious remain is"|FALSE
3160|"that which has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is"|FALSE
3160|"on the coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears"|FALSE
3160|"to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock."|FALSE
3160|"The shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the"|FALSE
3160|"head and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The"|FALSE
3160|"chair has a lion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is"|FALSE
3160|"bounded by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole"|FALSE
3160|"is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the"|FALSE
3160|"most remote antiquity.\""|FALSE
3160|"So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable"|FALSE
3160|"fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,"|FALSE
3160|"the other married a Chian."|FALSE
3160|"The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the"|FALSE
3160|"personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has"|FALSE
3160|"already been mentioned:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards"|FALSE
3160|"Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his"|FALSE
3160|"poem as the companion of Ulysses, in return for the care taken of him"|FALSE
3160|"when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to"|FALSE
3160|"Phemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.\""|FALSE
3160|"His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to"|FALSE
3160|"visit Greece whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is"|FALSE
3160|"said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the"|FALSE
3160|"vanity of the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no"|FALSE
3160|"mention, he set out for Samos. Here, being recognized by a Samian,"|FALSE
3160|"who had met with him in Chios, he was handsomely received, and"|FALSE
3160|"invited to join in celebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited"|FALSE
3160|"some verses, which gave great satisfaction, and by singing the"|FALSE
3160|"Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he earned a subsistence,"|FALSE
3160|"visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he was very"|FALSE
3160|"popular."|FALSE
3160|"In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,"|FALSE
3160|"now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his"|FALSE
3160|"death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an"|FALSE
3160|"enigma proposed by some fishermen's children."|FALSE
3160|"Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we"|FALSE
3160|"possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical"|FALSE
3160|"worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in"|FALSE
3160|"detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a"|FALSE
3160|"persevering, patient, and learned--but by no means consistent--series"|FALSE
3160|"of investigations has led.  In doing so, I profess to bring forward"|FALSE
3160|"statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability."|FALSE
3160|"\"Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in"|FALSE
3160|"doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who"|FALSE
3160|"have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The"|FALSE
3160|"majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the"|FALSE
3160|"Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the"|FALSE
3160|"Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.\""|FALSE
3160|"Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics"|FALSE
3160|"has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the"|FALSE
3160|"Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he"|FALSE
3160|"proceeds:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature"|FALSE
3160|"of things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is"|FALSE
3160|"the region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The"|FALSE
3160|"creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for"|FALSE
3160|"the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we"|FALSE
3160|"were in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could"|FALSE
3160|"wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their"|FALSE
3160|"origin, in all essential points, must have remained the secret of the"|FALSE
3160|"poet.\""|FALSE
3160|"From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of"|FALSE
3160|"human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic"|FALSE
3160|"investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was"|FALSE
3160|"Homer an individual? or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an"|FALSE
3160|"ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?"|FALSE
3160|"Well has Landor remarked: \"Some tell us there were twenty Homers;"|FALSE
3160|"some deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake"|FALSE
3160|"the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are"|FALSE
3160|"perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our"|FALSE
3160|"devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know"|FALSE
3160|"what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our"|FALSE
3160|"admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.\""|FALSE
3160|"But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests"|FALSE
3160|"contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been"|FALSE
3160|"nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of"|FALSE
3160|"first impressions by minute analysis, our editorial office compels us"|FALSE
3160|"to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the"|FALSE
3160|"Homeric question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief"|FALSE
3160|"period, to prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend"|FALSE
3160|"to dry details. Before, however, entering into particulars respecting"|FALSE
3160|"the question of this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the"|FALSE
3160|"Iliad,) I must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in"|FALSE
3160|"the following remarks:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the"|FALSE
3160|"better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its"|FALSE
3160|"original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that"|FALSE
3160|"its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice"|FALSE
3160|"to assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is"|FALSE
3160|"not the best qualification for the profound feeling, the"|FALSE
3160|"comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite"|FALSE
3160|"anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame; and we"|FALSE
3160|"would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions"|FALSE
3160|"and general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir"|FALSE
3160|"Astley Cooper."|FALSE
3160|"\"There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines"|FALSE
3160|"of Pope:--"|FALSE

3160|"about Peisistratus' time, about five hundred years after.\""|FALSE
3160|"Two French writers--Hedelin and Perrault--avowed a similar scepticism"|FALSE
3160|"on the subject; but it is in the \"Scienza Nuova\" of Battista Vico,"|FALSE
3160|"that we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended"|FALSE
3160|"by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the"|FALSE
3160|"Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following"|FALSE
3160|"bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A."|FALSE
3160|"Wolf, turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been"|FALSE
3160|"recently published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the"|FALSE
3160|"history of the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation"|FALSE
3160|"(though by no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the"|FALSE
3160|"position, previously announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the"|FALSE
3160|"separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been"|FALSE
3160|"cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order, until"|FALSE
3160|"the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a"|FALSE
3160|"step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies"|FALSE
3160|"of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier"|FALSE
3160|"times, to which their composition is referred; and that without"|FALSE
3160|"writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could"|FALSE
3160|"have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him,"|FALSE
3160|"transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and"|FALSE
3160|"convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long"|FALSE
3160|"manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in"|FALSE
3160|"Wolf's case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey."|FALSE
3160|"By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of"|FALSE
3160|"the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally"|FALSE
3160|"put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended"|FALSE
3160|"the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain"|FALSE
3160|"that they were written poems from the beginning."|FALSE
3160|"\"To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf"|FALSE

3160|"towards that view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in"|FALSE

3160|"Few things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne"|FALSE

3160|"authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is"|FALSE
3160|"in the famous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at"|FALSE

3160|"to the manuscript in his chest.\""|FALSE
3160|"The loss of the digamma, that crux of critics, that quicksand upon"|FALSE
3160|"which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove"|FALSE
3160|"beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had"|FALSE
3160|"undergone a considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to"|FALSE
3160|"suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change,"|FALSE
3160|"had written copies been preserved. If Chaucer's poetry, for instance,"|FALSE
3160|"had not been written, it could only have come down to us in a"|FALSE
3160|"softened form, more like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the"|FALSE
3160|"rough, quaint, noble original.  \"At what period,\" continues Grote,"|FALSE
3160|"\"these poems, or indeed any other Greek poems, first began to be"|FALSE
3160|"written, must be matter of conjecture, though there is ground for"|FALSE
3160|"assurance that it was before the time of Solon. If, in the absence of"|FALSE
3160|"evidence, we may venture upon naming any more determinate period, the"|FALSE
3160|"question at once suggests itself, What were the purposes which, in"|FALSE
3160|"that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must"|FALSE
3160|"have been intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary?"|FALSE
3160|"Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the"|FALSE
3160|"memory, but also interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in"|FALSE
3160|"conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice, pauses,"|FALSE
3160|"and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery,"|FALSE
3160|"and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce. Not for the"|FALSE
3160|"general public--they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic"|FALSE
3160|"delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded"|FALSE
3160|"festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be"|FALSE
3160|"suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of"|FALSE
3160|"readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had"|FALSE
3160|"experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the"|FALSE
3160|"written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of"|FALSE
3160|"the impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the"|FALSE
3160|"statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early"|FALSE
3160|"societies, and there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading"|FALSE
3160|"class existed. If we could discover at what time such a class first"|FALSE
3160|"began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time"|FALSE
3160|"when the old epic poems were first committed to writing. Now the"|FALSE
3160|"period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as"|FALSE
3160|"having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading"|FALSE
3160|"class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the"|FALSE
3160|"Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of Terpander,"|FALSE
3160|"Kallinus, Archilochus, Simenides of Amorgus, &c. I ground this"|FALSE
3160|"supposition on the change then operated in the character and"|FALSE
3160|"tendencies of Grecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic"|FALSE
3160|"measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter,"|FALSE
3160|"and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical"|FALSE
3160|"past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a change was"|FALSE
3160|"important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of"|FALSE
3160|"publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the"|FALSE
3160|"nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at"|FALSE
3160|"the old epical treasures of the people, as well as a thirst for new"|FALSE
3160|"poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it may well be"|FALSE
3160|"considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from"|FALSE
3160|"their own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric"|FALSE
3160|"rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and"|FALSE
3160|"eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer. There seems,"|FALSE
3160|"therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this"|FALSE
3160|"newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of"|FALSE
3160|"the Homeric poems and other old epics,--the Thebais and the Cypria,"|FALSE
3160|"as well as the Iliad and the Odyssey,--began to be compiled towards"|FALSE
3160|"the middle of the seventh century B.C. I; and the opening of Egypt to"|FALSE
3160|"Grecian commerce, which took place about the same period, would"|FALSE
3160|"furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to"|FALSE
3160|"write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly"|FALSE
3160|"increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it: so that before"|FALSE
3160|"the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and"|FALSE
3160|"manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a"|FALSE
3160|"certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference"|FALSE
3160|"against the carelessness of individual rhapsodies.\""|FALSE
3160|"But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession"|FALSE
3160|"of the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following"|FALSE
3160|"observations:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,"|FALSE
3160|"throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid"|FALSE
3160|"compilation, at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast into"|FALSE
3160|"its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the"|FALSE
3160|"Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright"|FALSE
3160|"period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more"|FALSE
3160|"than the fame, and the faint echo; if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and"|FALSE
3160|"Simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and"|FALSE
3160|"Odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange, to connect, to"|FALSE
3160|"harmonize, that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of"|FALSE
3160|"Athenian manufacture should not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies"|FALSE
3160|"may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own"|FALSE
3160|"ignorance of the language of the Homeric age; however the irregular"|FALSE
3160|"use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name"|FALSE
3160|"of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the"|FALSE
3160|"fair one herself among the heroes of her age; however Mr. Knight may"|FALSE
3160|"have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form;"|FALSE
3160|"however, finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more"|FALSE
3160|"marked and distinguishing characteristics:--still it is difficult to"|FALSE
3160|"suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and"|FALSE
3160|"transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray the"|FALSE
3160|"incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression."|FALSE
3160|"It is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique"|FALSE
3160|"style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of"|FALSE
3160|"the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in his continuation of Sir"|FALSE
3160|"Tristram."|FALSE
3160|"\"If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian"|FALSE
3160|"compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total"|FALSE
3160|"absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of"|FALSE
3160|"observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier"|FALSE
3160|"times, the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of"|FALSE
3160|"their ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early"|FALSE
3160|"Greece embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate"|FALSE
3160|"and insignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their"|FALSE
3160|"ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,"|FALSE
3160|"indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to"|FALSE
3160|"historic fact; that in the great maritime expedition of western"|FALSE
3160|"Greece against the rival and half-kindred empire of the"|FALSE
3160|"Laomedontiadae, the chieftain of Thessaly, from his valour and the"|FALSE
3160|"number of his forces, may have been the most important ally of the"|FALSE
3160|"Peloponnesian sovereign: the pre-eminent value of the ancient poetry"|FALSE
3160|"on the Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the"|FALSE
3160|"Athenians to yield to their taste. The songs which spoke of their own"|FALSE
3160|"great ancestor were, no doubt, of far inferior sublimity and"|FALSE
3160|"popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid would have been much more"|FALSE
3160|"likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers of"|FALSE
3160|"ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Odysseid. Could France have"|FALSE
3160|"given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the hero of the"|FALSE
3160|"Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are sometimes"|FALSE
3160|"called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its direful"|FALSE
3160|"consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle,"|FALSE
3160|"as to admit no rivalry,--it is still surprising, that throughout the"|FALSE
3160|"whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship"|FALSE
3160|"of an Athenian hand; and that the national spirit of a race, who have"|FALSE
3160|"at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self-admiring"|FALSE
3160|"neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self-denial to the"|FALSE
3160|"almost total exclusion of their own ancestors--or, at least, to the"|FALSE
3160|"questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably"|FALSE
3160|"skilled in the military tactics of his age.\""|FALSE
3160|"To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that"|FALSE
3160|"Wolf's objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey"|FALSE
3160|"have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they"|FALSE
3160|"have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the"|FALSE
3160|"difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather"|FALSE
3160|"augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is"|FALSE
3160|"Lachmann's modification of his theory any better. He divides the"|FALSE
3160|"first twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and"|FALSE
3160|"treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one"|FALSE
3160|"regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of"|FALSE
3160|"Peisistratus. This as Grote observes, \"ex-plains the gaps and"|FALSE
3160|"contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else.\""|FALSE
3160|"Moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the"|FALSE
3160|"so-called sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following"|FALSE
3160|"leading men in the first battle after the secession of Achilles:"|FALSE
3160|"Elphenor, chief of the Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians;"|FALSE
3160|"Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odins, of the Halizonians:  Pirous and"|FALSE
3160|"Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes again make their"|FALSE
3160|"appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that \"it seems"|FALSE
3160|"strange that any number of independent poets should have so"|FALSE
3160|"harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.\""|FALSE
3160|"The discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in"|FALSE
3160|"the fifth book, weeps at his son's funeral in the thirteenth, can"|FALSE
3160|"only be regarded as the result of an interpolation."|FALSE
3160|"Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the"|FALSE
3160|"subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian"|FALSE
3160|"theory, and of Lachmann's modifications, with the character of"|FALSE
3160|"Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,"|FALSE
3160|"that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these"|FALSE
3160|"poems, or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by"|FALSE
3160|"Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In"|FALSE
3160|"short, \"a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of"|FALSE
3160|"pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as"|FALSE
3160|"the period of its first compilation.\" The friends or literary"|FALSE
3160|"/employes/ of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already"|FALSE
3160|"ancient, and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the"|FALSE
3160|"Peisistratic \"recension,\" goes far to prove, that, among the numerous"|FALSE
3160|"manuscripts they examined, this was either wanting, or thought"|FALSE
3160|"unworthy of attention."|FALSE
3160|"\"Moreover,\" he continues, \"the whole tenor of the poems themselves"|FALSE
3160|"confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad"|FALSE
3160|"or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age"|FALSE
3160|"of Peisistratus--nothing which brings to our view the alterations"|FALSE
3160|"brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined"|FALSE
3160|"money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and"|FALSE
3160|"republican governments, the close military array, the improved"|FALSE
3160|"construction of ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual"|FALSE
3160|"frequentation of religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins"|FALSE
3160|"of religion, &c., familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations"|FALSE
3160|"Onomakritus, and the other literary friends of Peisistratus, could"|FALSE
3160|"hardly have failed to notice, even without design, had they then, for"|FALSE
3160|"the first time, undertaken the task of piecing together many"|FALSE
3160|"self-existent epics into one large aggregate. Everything in the two"|FALSE
3160|"great Homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to an"|FALSE
3160|"age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even"|FALSE
3160|"the interpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are"|FALSE
3160|"pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before"|FALSE
3160|"Christ, and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus--in"|FALSE
3160|"some cases even by Arktinus and Hesiod--as genuine Homeric matter. As"|FALSE
3160|"far as the evidences on the case, as well internal as external,"|FALSE
3160|"enable us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and"|FALSE
3160|"Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand (always allowing"|FALSE
3160|"for partial divergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our"|FALSE
3160|"first trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it"|FALSE
3160|"be added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the"|FALSE
3160|"most important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in"|FALSE
3160|"reference to Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into"|FALSE
3160|"the anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the"|FALSE
3160|"subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive"|FALSE
3160|"contrasts between their former and their later condition.\""|FALSE
3160|"On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of"|FALSE
3160|"Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although I must"|FALSE
3160|"confess that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his"|FALSE
3160|"labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition"|FALSE
3160|"or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the"|FALSE
3160|"work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and"|FALSE
3160|"elegant, mind of that Athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient"|FALSE
3160|"and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and"|FALSE
3160|"reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not"|FALSE
3160|"repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written"|FALSE
3160|"or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their"|FALSE
3160|"reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less"|FALSE
3160|"satisfied we are upon either subject."|FALSE
3160|"I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the"|FALSE
3160|"preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a"|FALSE
3160|"version of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its"|FALSE
3160|"historical probability must be measured by that of many others"|FALSE
3160|"relating to the Spartan Confucius."|FALSE
3160|"I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt,"|FALSE
3160|"made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like"|FALSE
3160|"consistency. It is as follows:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common"|FALSE
3160|"sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to 'discourse in"|FALSE
3160|"excellent music' among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes"|FALSE
3160|"in the United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events"|FALSE
3160|"passing around them. But what was passing around them? The grand"|FALSE
3160|"events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress"|FALSE
3160|"themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon"|FALSE
3160|"their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue"|FALSE
3160|"of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient"|FALSE
3160|"times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with"|FALSE
3160|"Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a"|FALSE
3160|"species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next"|FALSE
3160|"followed, as it aided the memory considerably."|FALSE
3160|"\"It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that"|FALSE
3160|"a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most"|FALSE
3160|"probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great"|FALSE
3160|"utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of"|FALSE
3160|"Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them"|FALSE
3160|"by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the"|FALSE
3160|"'Odyssea.' The author, however, did not affix his own name to the"|FALSE
3160|"poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the"|FALSE
3160|"archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by"|FALSE
3160|"him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector;"|FALSE
3160|"but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his"|FALSE
3160|"mere drudging arrangement of other people's ideas; for, as Grote has"|FALSE
3160|"finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, 'a great poet"|FALSE
3160|"might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive"|FALSE

3160|"\"While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,"|FALSE
3160|"recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind"|FALSE
3160|"seized the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleis grew"|FALSE
3160|"under his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the"|FALSE
3160|"poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work; and the disjointed"|FALSE
3160|"lays of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating"|FALSE
3160|"to the Cid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes"|FALSE
3160|"knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has"|FALSE
3160|"proved; but, first, the poems were destined to undergo many"|FALSE
3160|"vicissitudes and corruptions, by the people who took to singing them"|FALSE
3160|"in the streets, assemblies, and agoras.  However, Solon first, and"|FALSE
3160|"then Peisistratus, and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the"|FALSE
3160|"poems, and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their"|FALSE
3160|"original integrity in a great measure.\""|FALSE
3160|"Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which"|FALSE
3160|"have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I"|FALSE
3160|"must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of"|FALSE
3160|"the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations"|FALSE
3160|"disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may"|FALSE
3160|"here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the"|FALSE
3160|"negligence of the copyist, would be an absurd and captious"|FALSE
3160|"assumption; but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal, if"|FALSE
3160|"we would either understand or enjoy these poems. In maintaining the"|FALSE
3160|"authenticity and personality of their one author, be he Homer or"|FALSE
3160|"Melesigenes, /quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit/, I feel"|FALSE
3160|"conscious that, while the whole weight of historical evidence is"|FALSE
3160|"against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a"|FALSE
3160|"plurality of authors, the most powerful internal evidence, and that"|FALSE
3160|"which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the"|FALSE
3160|"soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary."|FALSE
3160|"The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise."|FALSE
3160|"Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an"|FALSE
3160|"attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its"|FALSE
3160|"importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store"|FALSE
3160|"on its aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the"|FALSE
3160|"emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had"|FALSE
3160|"they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he"|FALSE
3160|"would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in"|FALSE
3160|"laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often"|FALSE
3160|"least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not"|FALSE
3160|"poets by profession, but may be so per accidens. I do not at this"|FALSE
3160|"moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially"|FALSE
3160|"improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from"|FALSE
3160|"Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand"|FALSE
3160|"minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and"|FALSE
3160|"jejune."|FALSE
3160|"But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will"|FALSE
3160|"exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down"|FALSE
3160|"an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have"|FALSE
3160|"previously dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the"|FALSE
3160|"axe and the pruning knife by wholesale; and, inconsistent in"|FALSE
3160|"everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation,"|FALSE
3160|"they cut out book after book, passage after passage, till the author"|FALSE
3160|"is reduced to a collection of fragments, or till those who fancied"|FALSE
3160|"they possessed the works of some great man, find that they have been"|FALSE
3160|"put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare"|FALSE
3160|"the theories of Knight, Wolf, Lachmann; and others, we shall feel"|FALSE
3160|"better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the"|FALSE
3160|"apocryphal position of Homer. One rejects what another considers the"|FALSE
3160|"turning-point of his theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging"|FALSE
3160|"what another would explain by omitting something else."|FALSE
3160|"Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon"|FALSE
3160|"as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary"|FALSE
3160|"skill, seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies"|FALSE
3160|"attributed to Seneca are by four different authors. Now, I will"|FALSE
3160|"venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in"|FALSE
3160|"their borrowed phraseology--a phraseology with which writers like"|FALSE
3160|"Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves--in"|FALSE
3160|"their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an"|FALSE
3160|"ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few"|FALSE
3160|"writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the"|FALSE
3160|"same gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a"|FALSE
3160|"great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin"|FALSE
3160|"astonished the world with the startling announcement that the AEneid"|FALSE
3160|"of Virgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now,"|FALSE
3160|"without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry"|FALSE
3160|"and learning--nay, the refined acuteness--which scholars like Wolf"|FALSE
3160|"have bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many"|FALSE
3160|"of our modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise"|FALSE
3160|"and entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can"|FALSE
3160|"I help thinking that the literary history of more recent times will"|FALSE
3160|"account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the"|FALSE
3160|"Iliad and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first"|FALSE
3160|"creation."|FALSE
3160|"I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus"|FALSE
3160|"were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason"|FALSE
3160|"why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad"|FALSE
3160|"in his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus"|FALSE
3160|"should have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others."|FALSE
3160|"But, after all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that"|FALSE
3160|"they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry"|FALSE
3160|"most powerfully appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The"|FALSE
3160|"ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of"|FALSE
3160|"Homer, does too much violence to that inward emotion, which makes our"|FALSE
3160|"whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of"|FALSE
3160|"Chios. To believe the author of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to"|FALSE
3160|"degrade the powers of human invention; to elevate analytical judgment"|FALSE
3160|"at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul; and to"|FALSE
3160|"forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus. There is a"|FALSE
3160|"catholicity, so to speak, in the very name of Homer. Our faith in the"|FALSE
3160|"author of the Iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has"|FALSE
3160|"taught us a better."|FALSE
3160|"While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has"|FALSE
3160|"nature herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius"|FALSE
3160|"in believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint,"|FALSE
3160|"hovers round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from"|FALSE
3160|"that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not"|FALSE
3160|"exhaust,--still I am far from wishing to deny that the author of"|FALSE
3160|"these great poems found a rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked"|FALSE
3160|"mythical storehouse, from whence he might derive both subject and"|FALSE
3160|"embellishment. But it is one thing to use existing romances in the"|FALSE
3160|"embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem itself from"|FALSE
3160|"such materials. What consistency of style and execution can be hoped"|FALSE
3160|"for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will"|FALSE
3160|"not be the infallible result?"|FALSE
3160|"A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other"|FALSE
3160|"bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality."|FALSE
3160|"In fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward"|FALSE
3160|"impressions--nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary"|FALSE
3160|"agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless"|FALSE
3160|"there be some grand pervading principle--some invisible, yet most"|FALSE
3160|"distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the"|FALSE
3160|"Iliad can never come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque,"|FALSE
3160|"episodes the most pathetic, local associations teeming with the"|FALSE
3160|"thoughts of gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or"|FALSE
3160|"reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet;"|FALSE
3160|"but, except the power to create a grand whole, to which these shall"|FALSE
3160|"be but as details and embellishments, be present, we shall have"|FALSE
3160|"nought but a scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers and weeds"|FALSE
3160|"strangling each other in their wild redundancy; we shall have a cento"|FALSE
3160|"of rags and tatters, which will require little acuteness to detect."|FALSE
3160|"Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and"|FALSE
3160|"aware as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my"|FALSE
3160|"belief, it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is"|FALSE
3160|"reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are"|FALSE
3160|"not by nature intended to know all things; still less, to compass the"|FALSE
3160|"powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at"|FALSE
3160|"our disposal. Were faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why"|FALSE
3160|"God willed our ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught"|FALSE
3160|"the contrary lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be"|FALSE
3160|"especially tried, touching the men and the events which have wrought"|FALSE
3160|"most influence upon the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of"|FALSE
3160|"sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good, which"|FALSE
3160|"seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their"|FALSE
3160|"existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the giants of"|FALSE
3160|"intellect by an homaeopathic dynameter."|FALSE
3160|"Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our"|FALSE
3160|"thoughts even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right"|FALSE
3160|"spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled,"|FALSE
3160|"too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the"|FALSE
3160|"minute spots which mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic"|FALSE
3160|"poem, we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we"|FALSE
3160|"in imagination must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves,"|FALSE
3160|"burn with the same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And"|FALSE
3160|"if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm"|FALSE
3160|"will scarcely suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that"|FALSE
3160|"the poems of Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the"|FALSE
3160|"greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of"|FALSE
3160|"song."|FALSE
3160|"And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems"|FALSE
3160|"their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren,"|FALSE
3160|"who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely"|FALSE
3160|"observes:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet"|FALSE
3160|"has ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his"|FALSE
3160|"countrymen.  Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character"|FALSE
3160|"of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the"|FALSE
3160|"Greeks. This is a feature in their character which was not wholly"|FALSE
3160|"erased even in the period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and"|FALSE
3160|"sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had already been"|FALSE
3160|"accomplished; and they paid homage to his superior genius. He held up"|FALSE
3160|"before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world"|FALSE
3160|"of gods and heroes, no less than of feeble mortals, and to behold"|FALSE
3160|"them reflected with purity and truth. His poems are founded on the"|FALSE
3160|"first feeling of human nature; on the love of children, wife, and"|FALSE
3160|"country; on that passion which outweighs all others, the love of"|FALSE
3160|"glory. His songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized"|FALSE
3160|"with all the feelings of man; and therefore they enter, and will"|FALSE
3160|"continue to enter, every breast which cherishes the same sympathies."|FALSE
3160|"If it is granted to his immortal spirit, from another heaven than any"|FALSE
3160|"of which he dreamed on earth, to look down on his race, to see the"|FALSE
3160|"nations from the fields of Asia, to the forests of Hercynia,"|FALSE
3160|"performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to"|FALSE
3160|"flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand,"|FALSE
3160|"of elevated, of glorious productions, which had been called into"|FALSE
3160|"being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal spirit may reside,"|FALSE
3160|"this alone would suffice to complete his happiness.\""|FALSE
3160|"Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the \"Apotheosis of"|FALSE
3160|"Homer\" is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association,"|FALSE
3160|"how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds,"|FALSE
3160|"is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The"|FALSE
3160|"more we read, and the more we think--think as becomes the readers of"|FALSE
3160|"Homer,--the more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of"|FALSE
3160|"Poetry gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were"|FALSE
3160|"the means of its preservation, let us rather be thankful for the"|FALSE
3160|"treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek"|FALSE
3160|"to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories,"|FALSE
3160|"whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each"|FALSE
3160|"other."|FALSE
3160|"As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not"|FALSE
3160|"included in Pope's translation, I will content myself with a brief"|FALSE
3160|"account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer"|FALSE
3160|"who has done it full justice:--"|FALSE
3160|"\"This poem,\" says Coleridge, \"is a short mock-heroic of ancient date."|FALSE
3160|"The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and"|FALSE
3160|"corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a"|FALSE
3160|"juvenile essay of Homer's genius; others have attributed it to the"|FALSE
3160|"same Pigrees mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems"|FALSE
3160|"to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the"|FALSE
3160|"author of which was uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the"|FALSE
3160|"age of the Ptolemies, know or care about that department of criticism"|FALSE
3160|"employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings. As to"|FALSE
3160|"this little poem being a youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems"|FALSE
3160|"sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end, it is a plain"|FALSE
3160|"and palpable parody, not only of the general spirit, but of numerous"|FALSE
3160|"passages of the Iliad itself; and, even if no such intention to"|FALSE
3160|"parody were discernible in it, the objection would still remain, that"|FALSE
3160|"to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of"|FALSE
3160|"poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in the"|FALSE
3160|"development of national taste, which the history of every other"|FALSE
3160|"people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost ascertained to be a"|FALSE
3160|"law of the human mind; it is in a state of society much more refined"|FALSE
3160|"and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that any popularity"|FALSE
3160|"would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in"|FALSE
3160|"this poem; and the fact of there having existed three other poems of"|FALSE
3160|"the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as much reason"|FALSE
3160|"to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of"|FALSE
3160|"the Homeric age.  Knight infers from the usage of the word /deltoz/,"|FALSE
3160|"'writing tablet,' instead of /diphthera/, 'skin,' which, according to"|FALSE
3160|"Herod 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that"|FALSE
3160|"purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and"|FALSE
3160|"generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a strong"|FALSE
3160|"argument against so ancient a date for its composition.\""|FALSE
3160|"Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope's"|FALSE
3160|"design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,"|FALSE
3160|"and on my own purpose in the present edition."|FALSE
3160|"Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and"|FALSE
3160|"his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of"|FALSE
3160|"Ogilby.  It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the"|FALSE
3160|"impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense,"|FALSE
3160|"rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of"|FALSE
3160|"language. Hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an"|FALSE
3160|"elegant paraphrase than a translation. There are, to be sure, certain"|FALSE
3160|"conventional anecdotes, which prove that Pope consulted various"|FALSE
3160|"friends, whose classical attainments were sounder than his own,"|FALSE
3160|"during the undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations"|FALSE
3160|"were the result rather of the contradictory versions already"|FALSE
3160|"existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the"|FALSE
3160|"original. And in those days, what is called literal translation was"|FALSE
3160|"less cultivated than at present. If something like the general sense"|FALSE
3160|"could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if"|FALSE
3160|"the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made"|FALSE
3160|"consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet's meaning, his"|FALSE
3160|"words were less jealously sought for, and those who could read so"|FALSE
3160|"good a poem as Pope's Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied."|FALSE
3160|"It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope's translation by our own"|FALSE
3160|"advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look"|FALSE
3160|"at it as a most delightful work in itself,--a work which is as much a"|FALSE
3160|"part of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not"|FALSE
3160|"be torn from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once"|FALSE
3160|"was our most cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize,"|FALSE
3160|"merely because Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more"|FALSE
3160|"accurate as to /amphikipellon/ being an adjective, and not a"|FALSE
3160|"substantive. Far be it from us to defend the faults of Pope,"|FALSE
3160|"especially when we think of Chapman's fine, bold, rough old"|FALSE
3160|"English;--far be it from us to hold up his translation as what a"|FALSE
3160|"translation of Homer might be. But we can still dismiss Pope's Iliad"|FALSE
3160|"to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that they must"|FALSE
