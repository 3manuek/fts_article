626|"Richard de Bury (1281-1345), so called from being born near Bury St.Edmunds, was the son of Sir Richard Aungerville. He studied at Oxford;and was subsequently chosen to be tutor to Prince Edward of Windsor,afterwards Edward III.  His loyalty to the cause of Queen Isabella andthe Prince involved him in danger.  On the accession of his pupil hewas made successively Cofferer, Treasurer of the Wardrobe, Archdeaconof Northampton, Prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, and Lichfield, Keeper ofthe Privy Purse, Ambassador on two occasions to Pope John XXII, whoappointed him a chaplain of the papal chapel, Dean of Wells, andultimately, at the end of the year 1333, Bishop of Durham; the King andQueen, the King of Scots, and all the magnates north of the Trent,together with a multitude of nobles and many others, were present athis enthronization.  It is noteworthy that during his stay at Avignon,probably in 1330, he made the acquaintance of Petrarch, who has left usa brief account of their intercourse.  In 1332 Richard visitedCambridge, as one of the King's commissioners, to inquire into thestate of the King's Scholars there, and perhaps then became a member ofthe Gild of St. Mary--one of the two gilds which founded Corpus ChristiCollege."|FALSE
626|"In 1334 he became High Chancellor of England, and Treasurer in 1336,resigning the former office in 1335, so that he might help the King indealing with affairs abroad and in Scotland, and took a mostdistinguished part in diplomatic negociations between England andFrance.  In 1339 he was again in his bishopric.  Thereafter his nameoccurs often among those appointed to treat of peace with Philip ofFrance, and with Bruce of Scotland.  It appears that he was not inParliament in 1344.  Wasted by long sickness--longa infirmitatedecoctus--on the 14th of April, 1345, Richard de Bury died at Auckland,and was buried in Durham Cathedral."|FALSE

626|"According to the concluding note, the Philobiblon was completed on thebishop's fifty-eighth birthday, the 24th of January, 1345, so that eventhough weakened by illness, Richard must have been actively engaged inhis literary efforts to the very end of his generous and noble life.His enthusiastic devoted biographer Chambre[1] gives a vivid account ofthe bishop's bookloving propensities, supplementary to what can begathered from the Philobiblon itself.  Iste summe delectabatur inmultitudine librorum; he had more books, as was commonly reported, thanall the other English bishops put together.  He had a separate libraryin each of his residences, and wherever he was residing, so many bookslay about his bed-chamber, that it was hardly possible to stand or movewithout treading upon them.  All the time he could spare from businesswas devoted either to religious offices or to his books.  Every daywhile at table he would have a book read to him, unless some specialguest were present, and afterwards would engage in discussion on thesubject of the reading.  The haughty Anthony Bec delighted in theappendages of royalty--to be addressed by nobles kneeling, and to bewaited on in his presence-chamber and at his table by Knightsbare-headed and standing; but De Bury loved to surround himself withlearned scholars.  Among these were such men as Thomas Bradwardine,afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, and author of the De Causa Dei;Richard Fitzralph, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh, and famous for hishostility to the mendicant orders; Walter Burley, who dedicated to hima translation of the Politics of Aristotle made at his suggestion; JohnMauduit, the astronomer; Robert Holkot, author of many books; Richardde Kilvington; Richard Benworth, afterwards Bishop of London; andWalter Seagrave, who became Dean of Chichester.\"[2]"|FALSE

626|"[2] An unsuccessful attempt has been made to transfer the authorship ofthe book to Robert Holkot.  Various theories have been advanced againstRichard's claims.  It is noteworthy that his contemporary Adam Murimuthdisparages him as \"mediocriter literatus, volens tamen magnus clericusreputari,\" but such disparagement must be taken with the utmostcaution. The really difficult fact to be accounted for is the omissionon the part of Chambre to mention the book."|FALSE
626|"The Bishop's Books."|FALSE
626|"In the Philobiblon, Richard de Bury frankly and clearly describes hismeans and method of collecting books.  Anyhow his object was clearlynot selfish.  The treatise contains his rules for the library of thenew College at Oxford--Durham College (where Trinity College nowstands)--which he practically founded, though his successor, BishopHatfield, carried the scheme into effect.  It is traditionally reportedthat Richard's books were sent, in his lifetime or after his death, tothe house of the Durham Benedictines at Oxford, and there remaineduntil the dissolution of the College by Henry VIII., when they weredispersed, some going into Duke Humphrey's (the University) library,others to Balliol College, and the remainder passing into the hands ofDr. George Owen, who purchased the site of the dissolved College.[3]"|FALSE
626|"[3] Mr. J. W. Clark puts the matter as follows:--\"Durham College,maintained by the Benedictines of Durham, was supplied with books fromthe mother-house, lists of which have been preserved; and subsequentlya library was built there to contain the collection bequeathed in 1345by Richard de Bury\" (The Care of Books, p.  142).  Mr. Thomas pointsout that De Bury's executors sold at least some portion of his books;and, moreover, his biographer says nothing of a library at Oxford.Possibly the scheme was never carried out.  In the British Museum (Roy.13 D. iv. 3) is a large folio MS. of the works of John of Salisbury,which was one of the books bought back from the Bishop's executors."|FALSE
626|"Unfortunately, the \"special catalogue\" of his books prepared by Richardhas not come down to us; but \"from his own book and from the bookscited in the works of his friends and housemates, who may reasonably besupposed to have drawn largely from the bishop's collection, it wouldbe possible to restore a hypothetical but not improbable BibliothecaRicardi de Bury.  The difficulty would be with that contemporaryliterature, which they would think below the dignity of quotation, butwhich we know the Bishop collected.\""|FALSE
626|"Early Editions of the Philobiblon."|FALSE
626|"The book was first printed at Cologne in 1473, at Spires in 1483, andat Paris in 1500.  The first English edition appeared in 1598-9, editedby Thomas James, Bodley's first librarian.  Other editions appeared inGermany in 1610, 1614, 1674 and 1703; at Paris in 1856; at Albany in1861.  The texts were, with the exception of those issued in 1483 and1599, based on the 1473 edition; though the French edition andtranslation of 1856, prepared by M. Cocheris, claimed to be a criticalversion, it left the text untouched, and merely gave the variousreadings of the three Paris manuscripts at the foot of the pages; thesereadings are moreover badly chosen, and the faults of the version arefurther to be referred to the use of the ill-printed 1703 edition ascopy."|FALSE

626|"For fifteen years the enthusiastic editor--an ideal Bibliophile--hadtoiled at his labour of love, and his work was on all sides receivedwith the recognition due to his monumental achievement.  To the greatloss of English learning, he did not long survive the conclusion of hislabours.  The very limited edition of the work was soon exhausted, andit is by the most generous permission of his father, Mr. John Thomas,of Lower Broughton, Manchester, that the translation--the onlytrustworthy rendering of Richard de Bury's precious treatise--is now,for the first time, made accessible to the larger book-loving public,and fittingly inaugurates the present series of English classics.  Thegeneral Editor desires to express his best thanks to Mr. John Thomas,as also to Messrs. Kegan Paul, for their kindness in allowing him toavail himself of the materials included in the 1888 edition of thework.  He has attempted, in the brief Preface and Notes, to condenseMr. Thomas' labours in such a way as would have been acceptable to thelamented scholar, and though he has made bold to explain some fewtextual difficulties, and to add some few references, he would fainhope that these additions have been made with modest caution--with thereverence due to the unstinted toil of a Bibliophile after Richard deBury's own pattern.

626|"To all the faithful of Christ to whom the tenor of these presents maycome, Richard de Bury, by the divine mercy Bishop of Durham, wishetheverlasting salvation in the Lord and to present continually a piousmemorial of himself before God, alike in his lifetime and after hisdeath."|FALSE
626|"What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits towards me? asksthe most devout Psalmist, an invincible King and first among theprophets; in which most grateful question he approves himself a willingthank-offerer, a multifarious debtor, and one who wishes for a holiercounsellor than himself: agreeing with Aristotle, the chief ofphilosophers, who shows (in the 3rd and 6th books of his Ethics) thatall action depends upon counsel."|FALSE
626|"And indeed if so wonderful a prophet, having a fore-knowledge of divinesecrets, wished so anxiously to consider how he might gratefully repaythe blessings graciously bestowed, what can we fitly do, who are butrude thanksgivers and most greedy receivers, laden with infinite divinebenefits?  Assuredly we ought with anxious deliberation and abundantconsideration, having first invoked the Sevenfold Spirit, that it mayburn in our musings as an illuminating fire, fervently to prepare a waywithout hinderance, that the bestower of all things may be cheerfullyworshipped in return for the gifts that He has bestowed, that ourneighbour may be relieved of his burden, and that the guilt contractedby sinners every day may be redeemed by the atonement of almsgiving."|FALSE
626|"Forewarned therefore through the admonition of the Psalmist's devotionby Him who alone prevents and perfects the goodwill of man, withoutWhom we have no power even so much as to think, and Whose gift we doubtnot it is, if we have done anything good, we have diligently inquiredand considered in our own heart as well as with others, what among thegood offices of various works of piety would most please the Almighty,and would be more beneficial to the Church Militant.  And lo! theresoon occurred to our contemplation a host of unhappy, nay, rather ofelect scholars, in whom God the Creator and Nature His handmaid plantedthe roots of excellent morals and of famous sciences, but whom thepoverty of their circumstances so oppressed that before the frown ofadverse fortune the seeds of excellence, so fruitful in the cultivatedfield of youth, not being watered by the rain that they require, areforced to wither away. Thus it happens that \"bright virtue lurks buriedin obscurity,\" to use the words of Boethius, and burning lights are notput under a bushel, but for want of oil are utterly extinguished.  Thusthe field, so full of flower in Spring, has withered up before harvesttime; thus wheat degenerates to tares, and vines into the wild vines,and thus olives run into the wild olive; the tender stems rot awayaltogether, and those who might have grown up into strong pillars ofthe Church, being endowed with the capacity of a subtle intellect,abandon the schools of learning.  With poverty only as theirstepmother, they are repelled violently from the nectared cup ofphilosophy as soon as they have tasted of it and have become morefiercely thirsty by the very taste.  Though fit for the liberal artsand disposed to study the sacred writings alone, being deprived of theaid of their friends, by a kind of apostasy they return to themechanical arts solely to gain a livelihood, to the loss of the Churchand the degradation of the whole clergy.  Thus Mother Church conceivingsons is compelled to miscarry, nay, some misshapen monster is bornuntimely from her womb, and for lack of that little with which Natureis contented, she loses excellent pupils, who might afterwards becomechampions and athletes of the faith.  Alas, how suddenly the woof iscut, while the hand of the weaver is beginning his work! Alas, how thesun is eclipsed in the brightness of the dawn, and the planet in itscourse is hurled backwards, and, while it bears the nature and likenessof a star suddenly drops and becomes a meteor! What more piteous sightcan the pious man behold? What can more sharply stir the bowels of hispity? What can more easily melt a heart hard as an anvil into hottears? On the other hand, let us recall from past experience how muchit has profited the whole Christian commonwealth, not indeed toenervate students with the delights of a Sardanapalus or the riches ofa Croesus, but rather to support them in their poverty with the frugalmeans that become the scholar.  How many have we seen with our eyes,how many have we read of in books, who, distinguished by no pride ofbirth, and rejoicing in no rich inheritance, but supported only by thepiety of the good, have made their way to apostolic chairs, have mostworthily presided over faithful subjects, have bent the necks of theproud and lofty to the ecclesiastical yoke and have extended furtherthe liberties of the Church!"|FALSE
626|"Accordingly, having taken a survey of human necessities in everydirection, with a view to bestow our charity upon them, ourcompassionate inclinations have chosen to bear pious aid to thiscalamitous class of men, in whom there is nevertheless such hope ofadvantage to the Church, and to provide for them, not only in respectof things necessary to their support, but much more in respect of thebooks so useful to their studies.  To this end, most acceptable in thesight of God, our attention has long been unweariedly devoted.  Thisecstatic love has carried us away so powerfully, that we have resignedall thoughts of other earthly things, and have given ourselves up to apassion for acquiring books.  That our intent and purpose, therefore,may be known to posterity as well as to our contemporaries, and that wemay for ever stop the perverse tongues of gossipers as far as we areconcerned, we have published a little treatise written in the lighteststyle of the moderns; for it is ridiculous to find a slight mattertreated of in a pompous style.  And this treatise (divided into twentychapters) will clear the love we have had for books from the charge ofexcess, will expound the purpose of our intense devotion, and willnarrate more clearly than light all the circumstances of ourundertaking.  And because it principally treats of the love of books,we have chosen, after the fashion of the ancient Romans, fondly to nameit by a Greek word, Philobiblon."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER I"|FALSE
626|"THAT THE TREASURE OF WISDOM IS CHIEFLY CONTAINED IN BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"The desirable treasure of wisdom and science, which all men desire byan instinct of nature, infinitely surpasses all the riches of theworld; in respect of which precious stones are worthless; in comparisonwith which silver is as clay and pure gold is as a little sand; atwhose splendour the sun and moon are dark to look upon; compared withwhose marvellous sweetness honey and manna are bitter to the taste.  Ovalue of wisdom that fadeth not away with time, virtue everflourishing, that cleanseth its possessor from all venom!  O heavenlygift of the divine bounty, descending from the Father of lights, thatthou mayest exalt the rational soul to the very heavens!  Thou art thecelestial nourishment of the intellect, which those who eat shall stillhunger and those who drink shall still thirst, and the gladdeningharmony of the languishing soul which he that hears shall never beconfounded.  Thou art the moderator and rule of morals, which he whofollows shall not sin.  By thee kings reign and princes decree justice.By thee, rid of their native rudeness, their minds and tongues beingpolished, the thorns of vice being torn up by the roots, those menattain high places of honour, and become fathers of their country, andcompanions of princes, who without thee would have melted their spearsinto pruning-hooks and ploughshares, or would perhaps be feeding swinewith the prodigal."|FALSE
626|"Where dost thou chiefly lie hidden, O most elect treasure! and whereshall thirsting souls discover thee?"|FALSE
626|"Certes, thou hast placed thy tabernacle in books, where the Most High,the Light of lights, the Book of Life, has established thee.  Thereeveryone who asks receiveth thee, and everyone who seeks finds thee,and to everyone that knocketh boldly it is speedily opened.  Thereinthe cherubim spread out their wings, that the intellect of the studentsmay ascend and look from pole to pole, from the east and west, from thenorth and from the south.  Therein the mighty and incomprehensible GodHimself is apprehensibly contained and worshipped; therein is revealedthe nature of things celestial, terrestrial, and infernal; therein arediscerned the laws by which every state is administered, the offices ofthe celestial hierarchy are distinguished, and the tyrannies of demonsdescribed, such as neither the ideas of Plato transcend, nor the chairof Crato contained."|FALSE
626|"In books I find the dead as if they were alive; in books I foreseethings to come; in books warlike affairs are set forth; from books comeforth the laws of peace.  All things are corrupted and decay in time;Saturn ceases not to devour the children that he generates; all theglory of the world would be buried in oblivion, unless God had providedmortals with the remedy of books."|FALSE
626|"Alexander, the conqueror of the earth, Julius, the invader of Rome andof the world, who, the first in war and arts, assumed universal empireunder his single rule, faithful Fabricius and stern Cato, would nowhave been unknown to fame, if the aid of books had been wanting.Towers have been razed to the ground; cities have been overthrown;triumphal arches have perished from decay; nor can either pope or kingfind any means of more easily conferring the privilege of perpetuitythan by books.  The book that he has made renders its author thisservice in return, that so long as the book survives its author remainsimmortal and cannot die, as Ptolemy declares in the Prologue to hisAlmagest: He is not dead, he says, who has given life to science."|FALSE
626|"Who therefore will limit by anything of another kind the price of theinfinite treasure of books, from which the scribe who is instructedbringeth forth things new and old?  Truth that triumphs over allthings, which overcomes the king, wine, and women, which it is reckonedholy to honour before friendship, which is the way without turning andthe life without end, which holy Boethius considers to be threefold inthought, speech, and writing, seems to remain more usefully and tofructify to greater profit in books.  For the meaning of the voiceperishes with the sound; truth latent in the mind is wisdom that is hidand treasure that is not seen; but truth which shines forth in booksdesires to manifest itself to every impressionable sense.  It commendsitself to the sight when it is read, to the hearing when it is heard,and moreover in a manner to the touch, when it suffers itself to betranscribed, bound, corrected, and preserved.   The undisclosed truthof the mind, although it is the possession of the noble soul, yetbecause it lacks a companion, is not certainly known to be delightful,while neither sight nor hearing takes account of it.  Further the truthof the voice is patent only to the ear and eludes the sight, whichreveals to us more of the qualities of things, and linked with thesubtlest of motions begins and perishes as it were in a breath.  Butthe written truth of books, not transient but permanent, plainly offersitself to be observed, and by means of the pervious spherules of theeyes, passing through the vestibule of perception and the courts ofimagination, enters the chamber of intellect, taking its place in thecouch of memory, where it engenders the eternal truth of the mind."|FALSE
626|"Finally we must consider what pleasantness of teaching there is inbooks, how easy, how secret! How safely we lay bare the poverty ofhuman ignorance to books without feeling any shame!  They are masterswho instruct us without rod or ferule, without angry words, withoutclothes or money.  If you come to them they are not asleep; if you askand inquire of them they do not withdraw themselves; they do not chideif you make mistakes; they do not laugh at you if you are ignorant.  Obooks, who alone are liberal and free, who give to all who ask of youand enfranchise all who serve you faithfully!  By how many thousandtypes are ye commended to learned men in the Scriptures given us byinspiration of God!  For ye are the minds of profoundest wisdom, towhich the wise man sends his son that he may dig out treasures: Prov.ii.  Ye are the wells of living waters, which father Abraham firstdigged, Isaac digged again, and which the Philistines strive to fillup: Gen. xxvi.  Ye are indeed the most delightful ears of corn, full ofgrain, to be rubbed only by apostolic hands, that the sweetest food maybe produced for hungry souls: Matt. xii.  Ye are the golden pots inwhich manna is stored, and rocks flowing with honey, nay, combs ofhoney, most plenteous udders of the milk of life, garners ever full; yeare the tree of life and the fourfold river of Paradise, by which thehuman mind is nourished, and the thirsty intellect is watered andrefreshed.  Ye are the ark of Noah and the ladder of Jacob, and thetroughs by which the young of those who look therein are coloured; yeare the stones of testimony and the pitchers holding the lamps ofGideon, the scrip of David, from which the smoothest stones are takenfor the slaying of Goliath.  Ye are the golden vessels of the temple,the arms of the soldiers of the Church with which to quench all thefiery darts of the wicked, fruitful olives, vines of Engadi, fig-treesthat are never barren, burning lamps always to be held inreadiness--and all the noblest comparisons of Scripture may be appliedto books, if we choose to speak in figures."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER II"|FALSE
626|"THE DEGREE OF AFFECTION THAT IS PROPERLY DUE TO BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"Since the degree of affection a thing deserves depends upon the degreeof its value, and the previous chapter shows that the value of books isunspeakable, it is quite clear to the reader what is the probableconclusion from this.  I say probable, for in moral science we do notinsist upon demonstration, remembering that the educated man seeks suchdegree of certainty as he perceives the subject-matter will bear, asAristotle testifies in the first book of his Ethics.  For Tully doesnot appeal to Euclid, nor does Euclid rely upon Tully.  This at allevents we endeavour to prove, whether by logic or rhetoric, that allriches and all delights whatsoever yield place to books in thespiritual mind, wherein the Spirit which is charity ordereth charity.Now in the first place, because wisdom is contained in books more thanall mortals understand, and wisdom thinks lightly of riches, as theforegoing chapter declares.  Furthermore, Aristotle, in his Problems,determines the question, why the ancients proposed prizes to thestronger in gymnastic and corporeal contests, but never awarded anyprize for wisdom.  This question he solves as follows:  In gymnasticexercises the prize is better and more desirable than that for which itis bestowed; but it is certain that nothing is better than wisdom:wherefore no prize could be assigned for wisdom.  And therefore neitherriches nor delights are more excellent than wisdom.  Again, only thefool will deny that friendship is to be preferred to riches, since thewisest of men testifies this; but the chief of philosophers honourstruth before friendship, and the truthful Zorobabel prefers it to allthings.  Riches, then, are less than truth.  Now truth is chieflymaintained and contained in holy books--nay, they are written truthitself, since by books we do not now mean the materials of which theyare made.  Wherefore riches are less than books, especially as the mostprecious of all riches are friends, as Boethius testifies in the secondbook of his Consolation; to whom the truth of books according toAristotle is to be preferred.  Moreover, since we know that richesfirst and chiefly appertain to the support of the body only, while thevirtue of books is the perfection of reason, which is properly speakingthe happiness of man, it appears that books to the man who uses hisreason are dearer than riches.  Furthermore, that by which the faith ismore easily defended, more widely spread, more clearly preached, oughtto be more desirable to the faithful.  But this is the truth written inbooks, which our Saviour plainly showed, when he was about to contendstoutly against the Tempter, girding himself with the shield of truthand indeed of written truth, declaring \"it is written\" of what he wasabout to utter with his voice."|FALSE
626|"And, again, no one doubts that happiness is to be preferred to riches.But happiness consists in the operation of the noblest and diviner ofthe faculties that we possess--when the whole mind is occupied incontemplating the truth of wisdom, which is the most delectable of allour virtuous activities, as the prince of philosophers declares in thetenth book of the Ethics, on which account it is that philosophy isheld to have wondrous pleasures in respect of purity and solidity, ashe goes on to say.  But the contemplation of truth is never moreperfect than in books, where the act of imagination perpetuated bybooks does not suffer the operation of the intellect upon the truthsthat it has seen to suffer interruption.  Wherefore books appear to bethe most immediate instruments of speculative delight, and thereforeAristotle, the sun of philosophic truth, in considering the principlesof choice, teaches that in itself to philosophize is more desirablethan to be rich, although in certain cases, as where for instance oneis in need of necessaries, it may be more desirable to be rich than tophilosophize."|FALSE
626|"Moreover, since books are the aptest teachers, as the previous chapterassumes, it is fitting to bestow on them the honour and the affectionthat we owe to our teachers.  In fine, since all men naturally desireto know, and since by means of books we can attain the knowledge of theancients, which is to be desired beyond all riches, what man livingaccording to nature would not feel the desire of books?  And althoughwe know that swine trample pearls under foot, the wise man will nottherefore be deterred from gathering the pearls that lie before him.  Alibrary of wisdom, then, is more precious than all wealth, and allthings that are desirable cannot be compared to it.  Whoever thereforeclaims to be zealous of truth, of happiness, of wisdom or knowledge,aye, even of the faith, must needs become a lover of books."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER III"|FALSE
626|"WHAT WE ARE TO THINK OF THE PRICE IN THE BUYING OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"From what has been said we draw this corollary welcome to us, but (aswe believe) acceptable to few: namely, that no dearness of price oughtto hinder a man from the buying of books, if he has the money that isdemanded for them, unless it be to withstand the malice of the selleror to await a more favourable opportunity of buying.  For if it iswisdom only that makes the price of books, which is an infinitetreasure to mankind, and if the value of books is unspeakable, as thepremises show, how shall the bargain be shown to be dear where aninfinite good is being bought? Wherefore, that books are to be gladlybought and unwillingly sold, Solomon, the sun of men, exhorts us in theProverbs: Buy the truth, he says, and sell not wisdom.  But what we aretrying to show by rhetoric or logic, let us prove by examples fromhistory.  The arch-philosopher Aristotle, whom Averroes regards as thelaw of Nature, bought a few books of Speusippus straightway after hisdeath for 72,000 sesterces.  Plato, before him in time, but after himin learning, bought the book of Philolaus the Pythagorean, from whichhe is said to have taken the Timaeus, for 10,000 denaries, as AulusGellius relates in the Noctes Atticae. Now Aulus Gellius relates thisthat the foolish may consider how wise men despise money in comparisonwith books.  And on the other hand, that we may know that folly andpride go together, let us here relate the folly of Tarquin the Proud indespising books, as also related by Aulus Gellius.  An old woman,utterly unknown, is said to have come to Tarquin the Proud, the seventhking of Rome, offering to sell nine books, in which (as she declared)sacred oracles were contained, but she asked an immense sum for them,insomuch that the king said she was mad.  In anger she flung threebooks into the fire, and still asked the same sum for the rest.  Whenthe king refused it, again she flung three others into the fire andstill asked the same price for the three that were left.  At last,astonished beyond measure, Tarquin was glad to pay for three books thesame price for which he might have bought nine.  The old womanstraightway disappeared, and was never seen before or after.  Thesewere the Sibylline books, which the Romans consulted as a divine oracleby some one of the Quindecemvirs, and this is believed to have been theorigin of the Quindecemvirate.  What did this Sibyl teach the proudking by this bold deed, except that the vessels of wisdom, holy books,exceed all human estimation; and, as Gregory says of the kingdom ofHeaven:  They are worth all that thou hast?"|FALSE

626|"In sooth, while still untrained and helpless ye crept up to us, yespake as children, ye thought as children, ye cried as children andbegged to be made partakers of our milk.  But we being straightwaymoved by your tears gave you the breast of grammar to suck, which yeplied continually with teeth and tongue, until ye lost your nativebarbarousness and learned to speak with our tongues the mighty thingsof God.  And next we clad you with the goodly garments of philosophy,rhetoric and dialectic, of which we had and have a store, while ye werenaked as a tablet to be painted on.  For all the household ofphilosophy are clothed with garments, that the nakedness and rawness ofthe intellect may be covered. After this, providing you with thefourfold wings of the quadrivials that ye might be winged like theseraphs and so mount above the cherubim, we sent you to a friend atwhose door, if only ye importunately knocked, ye might borrow the threeloaves of the Knowledge of the Trinity, in which consists the finalfelicity of every sojourner below.  Nay, if ye deny that ye had theseprivileges, we boldly declare that ye either lost them by yourcarelessness, or that through your sloth ye spurned them when offeredto you. If these things seem but a light matter to you, we will add yetgreater things.  Ye are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holyrace, ye are a peculiar people chosen into the lot of God, ye arepriests and ministers of God, nay, ye are called the very Church ofGod, as though the laity were not to be called churchmen.  Ye, beingpreferred to the laity, sing psalms and hymns in the chancel, and,serving the altar and living by the altar, make the true body ofChrist, wherein God Himself has honoured you not only above the laity,but even a little higher than the angels.  For to whom of His angelshas He said at any time:  Thou art a priest for ever after the order ofMelchisedech?  Ye dispense the patrimony of the crucified one to thepoor, wherein it is required of stewards that a man be found faithful.Ye are shepherds of the Lord's flock, as well in example of life as inthe word of doctrine, which is bound to repay you with milk and wool."|FALSE
626|"Who are the givers of all these things, O clerks?  Is it not books?  Doye remember therefore, we pray, how many and how great liberties andprivileges are bestowed upon the clergy through us?  In truth, taughtby us who are the vessels of wisdom and intellect, ye ascend theteacher's chair and are called of men Rabbi.  By us ye becomemarvellous in the eyes of the laity, like great lights in the world,and possess the dignities of the Church according to your variousstations.  By us, while ye still lack the first down upon your cheeks,ye are established in your early years and bear the tonsure on yourheads, while the dread sentence of the Church is heard: Touch not mineanointed and do my prophets no harm, and he who has rashly touched themlet him forthwith by his own blow be smitten violently with the woundof an anathema.  At length yielding your lives to wickedness, reachingthe two paths of Pythagoras, ye choose the left branch, and goingbackward ye let go the lot of God which ye had first assumed, becomingcompanions of thieves.  And thus ever going from bad to worse, dyedwith theft and murder and manifold impurities, your fame and consciencestained by sins, at the bidding of justice ye are confined in manaclesand fetters, and are kept to be punished by a most shameful death.Then your friend is put far away, nor is there any to mourn your lot.Peter swears that he knows not the man: the people cry to the judge:Crucify, crucify Him!  If thou let this man go, thou act not Caesar'sfriend.  Now all refuge has perished, for ye must stand before thejudgment-seat, and there is no appeal, but only hanging is in store foryou. While the wretched man's heart is thus filled with woe and onlythe sorrowing Muses bedew their cheeks with tears, in his strait isheard on every side the wailing appeal to us, and to avoid the dangerof impending death he shows the slight sign of the ancient tonsurewhich we bestowed upon him, begging that we may be called to his aidand bear witness to the privilege bestowed upon him.  Then straightwaytouched with pity we run to meet the prodigal son and snatch thefugitive slave from the gates of death.  The book he has not forgottenis handed to him to be read, and while with lips stammering with fearhe reads a few words, the power of the judge is loosed, the accuser iswithdrawn, and death is put to flight.  O marvellous virtue of anempiric verse!  O saving antidote of dreadful ruin!  O precious readingof the psalter, which for this alone deserves to be called the book oflife! Let the laity undergo the judgment of the secular arm, thateither sewn up in sacks they may be carried out to Neptune, or plantedin the earth may fructify for Pluto, or may be offered amid the flamesas a fattened holocaust to Vulcan, or at least may be hung up as avictim to Juno: while our nursling at a single reading of the book oflife is handed over to the custody of the Bishop, and rigour is changedto favour, and the forum being transferred from the laity, death isrouted by the clerk who is the nursling of books."|FALSE
626|"But now let us speak of the clerks who are vessels of virtue.  Which ofyou about to preach ascends the pulpit or the rostrum without in someway consulting us?  Which of you enters the schools to teach or todispute without relying upon our support?  First of all, it behoves youto eat the book with Ezechiel, that the belly of your memory may besweetened within, and thus as with the panther refreshed, to whosebreath all beasts and cattle long to approach, the sweet savour of thespices it has eaten may shed a perfume without.  Thus our naturesecretly working in our own, listeners hasten up gladly, as theload-stone draws the iron nothing loth.  What an infinite host of bookslie at Paris or Athens, and at the same time resound in Britain and inRome! In truth, while resting they yet move, and while retaining theirown places they are carried about every way to the minds of listeners.Finally, by the knowledge of literature, we establish Priests, Bishops,Cardinals, and the Pope, that all things in the ecclesiasticalhierarchy may be fitly disposed.  For it is from books that everythingof good that befalls the clerical condition takes its origin.  But letthis suffice: for it pains us to recall what we have bestowed upon thedegenerate clergy, because whatever gifts are distributed to theungrateful seem to be lost rather than bestowed."|FALSE
626|"Let us next dwell a little on the recital of the wrongs with which theyrequite us, the contempts and cruelties of which we cannot recite anexample in each kind, nay, scarcely the main classes of the severalwrongs.  In the first place, we are expelled by force and arms from thehomes of the clergy, which are ours by hereditary right, who were usedto have cells of quietness in the inner chamber, but, alas! in theseunhappy times we are altogether exiled, suffering poverty without thegates.  For our places are seized now by dogs, now by hawks, now bythat biped beast whose cohabitation with the clergy was forbidden ofold, from which we have always taught our nurslings to flee more thanfrom the asp and the cockatrice; wherefore she, always jealous of thelove of us, and never to be appeased, at length seeing us in somecorner protected only by the web of some dead spider, with a frownabuses and reviles us with bitter words, declaring us alone of all thefurniture in the house to be unnecessary, and complaining that we areuseless for any household purpose, and advises that we should speedilybe converted into rich caps, sendal and silk and twice-dyed purple,robes and furs, wool and linen: and, indeed, not without reason, if shecould see our inmost hearts, if she had listened to our secretcounsels, if she had read the book of Theophrastus or Valerius, or onlyheard the twenty-fifth chapter of Ecclesiasticus with understandingears."|FALSE
626|"And hence it is that we have to mourn for the homes of which we havebeen unjustly robbed; and as to our coverings, not that they have notbeen given to us, but that the coverings anciently given to us havebeen torn by violent hands, insomuch that our soul is bowed down to thedust, our belly cleaveth unto the earth.  We suffer from variousdiseases, enduring pains in our backs and sides; we lie with our limbsunstrung by palsy, and there is no man who layeth it to heart, and noman who provides a mollifying plaster.  Our native whiteness that wasclear with light has turned to dun and yellow, so that no leech whoshould see us would doubt that we are diseased with jaundice.  Some ofus are suffering from gout, as our twisted extremities plainly show.The smoke and dust by which we are continuously plagued have dulled thekeenness of our visual rays, and are now infecting our bleared eyeswith ophthalmia.  Within we are devoured by the fierce gripings of ourentrails, which hungry worms cease not to gnaw, and we undergo thecorruption of the two Lazaruses, nor is there anyone to anoint us withbalm of cedar, nor to cry to us who have been four days dead andalready stink, Lazarus come forth!  No healing drug is bound around ourcruel wounds, which are so atrociously inflicted upon the innocent, andthere is none to put a plaster upon our ulcers; but ragged andshivering we are flung away into dark corners, or in tears take ourplace with holy Job upon his dunghill, or--too horrible to relate--areburied in the depths of the common sewers.  The cushion is withdrawnthat should support our evangelical sides, which ought to have thefirst claim upon the incomes of the clergy, and the common necessariesof life thus be for ever provided for us, who are entrusted to theircharge."|FALSE
626|"Again, we complain of another sort of injury which is too oftenunjustly inflicted upon our persons.  We are sold for bondmen andbondwomen, and lie as hostages in taverns with no one to redeem us.  Wefall a prey to the cruel shambles, where we see sheep and cattleslaughtered not without pious tears, and where we die a thousand timesfrom such terrors as might frighten even the brave.  We are handed overto Jews, Saracens, heretics and infidels, whose poison we always dreadabove everything, and by whom it is well known that some of our parentshave been infected with pestiferous venom.  In sooth, we who should betreated as masters in the sciences, and bear rule over the mechanicswho should be subject to us, are instead handed over to the governmentof subordinates, as though some supremely noble monarch should betrodden under foot by rustic heels.  Any seamster or cobbler or tailoror artificer of any trade keeps us shut up in prison for the luxuriousand wanton pleasures of the clergy."|FALSE

Ah! how often ye pretend thatwe who are ancient are but lately born, and try to pass us off as sonswho are really fathers, calling us who have made you clerks theproduction of your studies.  Indeed, we derived our origin from Athens,though we are now supposed to be from Rome; for Carmentis was alwaysthe pilferer of Cadmus, and we who were but lately born in England,will to-morrow be born again in Paris; and thence being carried toBologna, will obtain an Italian origin, based upon no affinity ofblood.  Alas! how ye commit us to treacherous copyists to be written,how corruptly ye read us and kill us by medication, while ye supposedye were correcting us with pious zeal.  Oftentimes we have to endurebarbarous interpreters, and those who are ignorant of foreign idiomspresume to translate us from one language into another; and thus allpropriety of speech is lost and our sense is shamefully mutilatedcontrary to the meaning of the author!  Truly noble would have been thecondition of books if it had not been for the presumption of the towerof Babel, if but one kind of speech had been transmitted by the wholehuman race."|FALSE

Moreover, that the faith of the Fathers is chieflyenshrined in books the second chapter has sufficiently shown, fromwhich it is clearer than light that ye ought to be zealous lovers ofbooks above all other Christians.  Ye are commanded to sow upon allwaters, because the Most High is no respecter of persons, nor does theMost Holy desire the death of sinners, who offered Himself to die forthem, but desires to heal the contrite in heart, to raise the fallen,and to correct the perverse in the spirit of lenity.  For which mostsalutary purpose our kindly Mother Church has planted you freely, andhaving planted has watered you with favours, and having watered you hasestablished you with privileges, that ye may be co-workers with pastorsand curates in procuring the salvation of faithful souls.  Wherefore,that the order of Preachers was principally instituted for the study ofthe Holy Scriptures and the salvation of their neighbours, is declaredby their constitutions, so that not only from the rule of BishopAugustine, which directs books to be asked for every day, but as soonas they have read the prologue of the said constitutions they may knowfrom the very title of the same that they are pledged to the love ofbooks."|FALSE
626|"But alas! a threefold care of superfluities, viz., of the stomach, ofdress, and of houses, has seduced these men and others following theirexample from the paternal care of books, and from their study.  For,forgetting the providence of the Saviour (who is declared by thePsalmist to think upon the poor and needy), they are occupied with thewants of the perishing body, that their feasts may be splendid andtheir garments luxurious, against the rule, and the fabrics of theirbuildings, like the battlements of castles, carried to a heightincompatible with poverty.  Because of these three things, we books,who have ever procured their advancement and have granted them to sitamong the powerful and noble, are put far from their heart's affectionand are reckoned as superfluities; except that they rely upon sometreatises of small value, from which they derive strange heresies andapocryphal imbecilities, not for the refreshment of souls, but ratherfor tickling the ears of the listeners.  The Holy Scripture is notexpounded, but is neglected and treated as though it were commonplaceand known to all, though very few have touched its hem, and though itsdepth is such, as Holy Augustine declares, that it cannot be understoodby the human intellect, however long it may toil with the utmostintensity of study.  From this he who devotes himself to itassiduously, if only He will vouchsafe to open the door who hasestablished the spirit of piety, may unfold a thousand lessons of moralteaching, which will flourish with the freshest novelty and willcherish the intelligence of the listeners with the most delightfulsavours. Wherefore the first professors of evangelical poverty, aftersome slight homage paid to secular science, collecting all their forceof intellect, devoted themselves to labours upon the sacred scripture,meditating day and night on the law of the Lord.  And whatever theycould steal from their famishing belly, or intercept from theirhalf-covered body, they thought it the highest gain to spend in buyingor correcting books.

Ye donot think upon Daniel and the bearer of the mess of boiled pottage, norrecollect Elijah who was delivered from hunger once in the desert byangels, again in the torrent by ravens, and again in Sarepta by thewidow, through the divine bounty, which gives to all flesh their meatin due season.  Ye descend (as we fear) by a wretched anticlimax,distrust of the divine goodness producing reliance upon your ownprudence, and reliance upon your own prudence begetting anxiety aboutworldly things, and excessive anxiety about worldly things taking awaythe love as well as the study of books; and thus poverty in these daysis abused to the injury of the Word of God, which ye have chosen onlyfor profit's sake."|FALSE

Their old homes were restored to their formerinmates, and forthwith boards of cedar with shelves and beams of gopherwood are most skilfully planed; inscriptions of gold and ivory aredesigned for the several compartments, to which the volumes themselvesare reverently brought and pleasantly arranged, so that no one hindersthe entrance of another or injures its brother by excessive crowding."|FALSE

626|"Although from our youth upwards we had always delighted in holdingsocial commune with learned men and lovers of books, yet when weprospered in the world and made acquaintance with the King's majestyand were received into his household, we obtained ampler facilities forvisiting everywhere as we would, and of hunting as it were certain mostchoice preserves, libraries private as well as public, and of theregular as well as of the secular clergy.  And indeed while we filledvarious offices to the victorious Prince and splendidly triumphant Kingof England, Edward the Third from the Conquest--whose reign may theAlmighty long and peacefully continue--first those about his court, butthen those concerning the public affairs of his kingdom, namely theoffices of Chancellor and Treasurer, there was afforded to us, inconsideration of the royal favour, easy access for the purpose offreely searching the retreats of books.  In fact, the fame of our loveof them had been soon winged abroad everywhere, and we were reported toburn with such desire for books, and especially old ones, that it wasmore easy for any man to gain our favour by means of books than ofmoney.  Wherefore, since supported by the goodness of the aforesaidprince of worthy memory, we were able to requite a man well or ill, tobenefit or injure mightily great as well as small, there flowed in,instead of presents and guerdons, and instead of gifts and jewels,soiled tracts and battered codices, gladsome alike to our eye andheart.  Then the aumbries of the most famous monasteries were thrownopen, cases were unlocked and caskets were undone, and volumes that hadslumbered through long ages in their tombs wake up and are astonished,and those that had lain hidden in dark places are bathed in the ray ofunwonted light.  These long lifeless books, once most dainty, but nowbecome corrupt and loathsome, covered with litters of mice and piercedwith the gnawings of the worms, and who were once clothed in purple andfine linen, now lying in sackcloth and ashes, given up to oblivion,seemed to have become habitations of the moth.  Natheless among these,seizing the opportunity, we would sit down with more delight than afastidious physician among his stores of gums and spices, and there wefound the object and the stimulus of our affections.  Thus the sacredvessels of learning came into our control and stewardship; some bygift, others by purchase, and some lent to us for a season."|FALSE

Indeed, if we had lovedgold and silver goblets, high-bred horses, or no small sums of money,we might in those days have furnished forth a rich treasury.  But intruth we wanted manuscripts not moneyscripts; we loved codices morethan florins, and preferred slender pamphlets to pampered palfreys."|FALSE

For this like a deliciousdraught sweetened the bitterness of our journeyings and after theperplexing intricacies and troublesome difficulties of causes, and theall but inextricable labyrinths of public affairs afforded us a littlebreathing space to enjoy a balmier atmosphere."|FALSE
626|"O Holy God of gods in Sion, what a mighty stream of pleasure made gladour hearts whenever we had leisure to visit Paris, the Paradise of theworld, and to linger there; where the days seemed ever few for thegreatness of our love! There are delightful libraries, more aromaticthan stores of spicery; there are luxuriant parks of all manner ofvolumes; there are Academic meads shaken by the tramp of scholars;there are lounges of Athens; walks of the Peripatetics; peaks ofParnassus; and porches of the Stoics.  There is seen the surveyor ofall arts and sciences Aristotle, to whom belongs all that is mostexcellent in doctrine, so far as relates to this passing sublunaryworld; there Ptolemy measures epicycles and eccentric apogees and thenodes of the planets by figures and numbers; there Paul reveals themysteries; there his neighbour Dionysius arranges and distinguishes thehierarchies; there the virgin Carmentis reproduces in Latin charactersall that Cadmus collected in Phoenician letters; there indeed openingour treasuries and unfastening our purse-strings we scattered moneywith joyous heart and purchased inestimable books with mud and sand.It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer.  But in vain; for beholdhow good and how pleasant it is to gather together the arms of theclerical warfare, that we may have the means to crush the attacks ofheretics, if they arise."|FALSE
626|"Further, we are aware that we obtained most excellent opportunities ofcollecting in the following way.  From our early years we attached toour society with the most exquisite solicitude and discarding allpartiality all such masters and scholars and professors in the severalfaculties as had become most distinguished by their subtlety of mindand the fame of their learning.  Deriving consolation from theirsympathetic conversation, we were delightfully entertained, now bydemonstrative chains of reasoning, now by the recital of physicalprocesses and the treatises of the doctors of the Church, now bystimulating discourses on the allegorical meanings of things, as by arich and well-varied intellectual feast.  Such men we chose as comradesin our years of learning, as companions in our chamber, as associateson our journeys, as guests at our table, and, in short, as helpmates inall the vicissitudes of life.  But as no happiness is permitted toendure for long, we were sometimes deprived of the bodily companionshipof some of these shining lights, when justice looking down from heaven,the ecclesiastical preferments and dignities that they deserved fell totheir portion.  And thus it happened, as was only right, that inattending to their own cures they were obliged to absent themselvesfrom attendance upon us."|FALSE
626|"We will add yet another very convenient way by which a great multitudeof books old as well as new came into our hands.  For we never regardedwith disdain or disgust the poverty of the mendicant orders, adoptedfor the sake of Christ; but in all parts of the world took them intothe kindly arms of our compassion, allured them by the most friendlyfamiliarity into devotion to ourselves, and having so allured themcherished them with munificent liberality of beneficence for the sakeof God, becoming benefactors of all of them in general in such wisethat we seemed none the less to have adopted certain individuals with aspecial fatherly affection.  To these men we were as a refuge in everycase of need, and never refused to them the shelter of our favour,wherefore we deserved to find them most special furtherers of ourwishes and promoters thereof in act and deed, who compassing land andsea, traversing the circuit of the world, and ransacking theuniversities and high schools of various provinces, were zealous incombatting for our desires, in the sure and certain hope of reward.What leveret could escape amidst so many keen-sighted hunters?  Whatlittle fish could evade in turn their hooks and nets and snares?  Fromthe body of the Sacred Law down to the booklet containing the fallaciesof yesterday, nothing could escape these searchers.  Was some devoutdiscourse uttered at the fountain-head of Christian faith, the holyRoman Curia, or was some strange question ventilated with novelarguments; did the solidity of Paris, which is now more zealous in thestudy of antiquity than in the subtle investigation of truth, didEnglish subtlety, which illumined by the lights of former times isalways sending forth fresh rays of truth, produce anything to theadvancement of science or the declaration of the faith, this wasinstantly poured still fresh into our ears, ungarbled by any babbler,unmutilated by any trifler, but passing straight from the purest ofwine-presses into the vats of our memory to be clarified."|FALSE
626|"But whenever it happened that we turned aside to the cities and placeswhere the mendicants we have mentioned had their convents, we did notdisdain to visit their libraries and any other repositories of books;nay, there we found heaped up amid the utmost poverty the utmost richesof wisdom.  We discovered in their fardels and baskets not only crumbsfalling from the masters' table for the dogs, but the shewbread withoutleaven and the bread of angels having in it all that is delicious; andindeed the garners of Joseph full of corn, and all the spoil of theEgyptians, and the very precious gifts which Queen Sheba brought toSolomon."|FALSE

They aresuccessors of Bezaleel in devising all manner of workmanship in silverand gold and precious stones for decorating the temple of the Church.They are cunning embroiderers, who fashion the breastplate and ephod ofthe high priest and all the various vestments of the priests.  Theyfashion the curtains of linen and hair and coverings of ram's skinsdyed red with which to adorn the tabernacle of the Church militant.They are husbandmen that sow, oxen treading out corn, soundingtrumpets, shining Pleiades and stars remaining in their courses, whichcease not to fight against Sisera.  And to pay due regard to truth,without prejudice to the judgment of any, although they lately at theeleventh hour have entered the lord's vineyard, as the books that areso fond of us eagerly declared in our sixth chapter, they have addedmore in this brief hour to the stock of the sacred books than all theother vine-dressers; following in the footsteps of Paul, the last to becalled but the first in preaching, who spread the gospel of Christ morewidely than all others.  Of these men, when we were raised to theepiscopate we had several of both orders, viz., the Preachers andMinors, as personal attendants and companions at our board, mendistinguished no less in letters than in morals, who devoted themselveswith unwearied zeal to the correction, exposition, tabulation, andcompilation of various volumes.  But although we have acquired a verynumerous store of ancient as well as modern works by the manifoldintermediation of the religious, yet we must laud the Preachers withspecial praise, in that we have found them above all the religious mostfreely communicative of their stores without jealousy, and proved themto be imbued with an almost Divine liberality, not greedy but fittingpossessors of luminous wisdom."|FALSE
626|"Besides all the opportunities mentioned above, we secured theacquaintance of stationers and booksellers, not only within our owncountry, but of those spread over the realms of France, Germany, andItaly, money flying forth in abundance to anticipate their demands; norwere they hindered by any distance or by the fury of the seas, or bythe lack of means for their expenses, from sending or bringing to usthe books that we required.

In so much did we receive those who broughtbooks, that the multitude of those who had preceded them did not lessenthe welcome of the after-comers, nor were the favours we had awardedyesterday prejudicial to those of to-day.

626|"HOW, ALTHOUGH WE PREFERRED THE WORKS OF THE ANCIENTS, WE HAVE NOTCONDEMNED THE STUDIES OF THE MODERNS"|FALSE
626|"Although the novelties of the moderns were never disagreeable to ourdesires, who have always cherished with grateful affection those whodevote themselves to study and who add anything either ingenious oruseful to the opinions of our forefathers, yet we have always desiredwith more undoubting avidity to investigate the well-tested labours ofthe ancients.  For whether they had by nature a greater vigour ofmental sagacity, or whether they perhaps indulged in closer applicationto study, or whether they were assisted in their progress by both thesethings, one thing we are perfectly clear about, that their successorsare barely capable of discussing the discoveries of their forerunners,and of acquiring those things as pupils which the ancients dug out bydifficult efforts of discovery.  For as we read that the men of oldwere of a more excellent degree of bodily development than modern timesare found to produce, it is by no means absurd to suppose that most ofthe ancients were distinguished by brighter faculties, seeing that inthe labours they accomplished of both kinds they are inimitable byposterity.   And so Phocas writes in the prologue to his Grammar:"|FALSE
626|"     Since all things have been said by men of sense     The only novelty is--to condense."|FALSE
626|"But in truth, if we speak of fervour of learning and diligence instudy, they gave up all their lives to philosophy; while nowadays ourcontemporaries carelessly spend a few years of hot youth, alternatingwith the excesses of vice, and when the passions have been calmed, andthey have attained the capacity of discerning truth so difficult todiscover, they soon become involved in worldly affairs and retire,bidding farewell to the schools of philosophy.  They offer the fumingmust of their youthful intellect to the  difficulties of philosophy,and bestow the clearer wine upon the money-making business of life.Further, as Ovid in the first book of the De Vetula justly complains:"|FALSE
626|"  The hearts of all men after gold aspire;  Few study to be wise, more to acquire:  Thus, Science! all thy virgin charms are sold,  Whose chaste embraces should disdain their gold,  Who seek not thee thyself, but pelf through thee,  Longing for riches, not philosophy."|FALSE

626|"  Thus Philosophy is seen  Exiled, and Philopecuny is queen,"|FALSE
626|"which is known to be the most violent poison of learning."|FALSE
626|"How the ancients indeed regarded life as the only limit of study, isshown by Valerius, in his book addressed to Tiberius, by many examples.Carneades, he says, was a laborious and lifelong soldier of wisdom:after he had lived ninety years, the same day put an end to his lifeand his philosophizing.  Isocrates in his ninety-fourth year wrote amost noble work.  Sophocles did the same when nearly a hundred yearsold.  Simonides wrote poems in his eightieth year.  Aulus Gellius didnot desire to live longer than he should be able to write, as he sayshimself in the prologue to the Noctes Atticae."|FALSE
626|"The fervour of study which possessed Euclid the Socratic, Taurus thephilosopher used to relate to incite young men to study, as Gelliustells in the book we have mentioned.  For the Athenians, hating thepeople of Megara, decreed that if any of the Megarensians enteredAthens, he should be put to death.  Then Euclid, who was a Megarensian,and had attended the lectures of Socrates before this decree,disguising himself in a woman's dress, used to go from Megara to Athensby night to hear Socrates, a distance of twenty miles and back.Imprudent and excessive was the fervour of Archimedes, a lover ofgeometry, who would not declare his name, nor lift his head from thediagram he had drawn, by which he might have prolonged his life, butthinking more of study than of life dyed with his life-blood the figurehe was studying."|FALSE
626|"There are very many such examples of our proposition, but the brevitywe aim at does not allow us to recall them.  But, painful to relate,the clerks who are famous in these days pursue a very different course.Afflicted with ambition in their tender years, and slightly fasteningto their untried arms the Icarian wings of presumption, theyprematurely snatch the master's cap; and mere boys become unworthyprofessors of the several faculties, through which they do not maketheir way step by step, but like goats ascend by leaps and bounds; and,having slightly tasted of the mighty stream, they think that they havedrunk it dry, though their throats are hardly moistened.  And becausethey are not grounded in the first rudiments at the fitting time, theybuild a tottering edifice on an unstable foundation, and now that theyhave grown up, they are ashamed to learn what they ought to havelearned while young, and thus they are compelled to suffer for ever fortoo hastily jumping at dignities they have not deserved.  For these andthe like reasons the tyros in the schools do not attain to the solidlearning of the ancients in a few short hours of study, although theymay enjoy distinctions, may be accorded titles, be authorized byofficial robes, and solemnly installed in the chairs of the elders.Just snatched from the cradle and hastily weaned, they mouth the rulesof Priscian and Donatus; while still beardless boys they gabble withchildish stammering the Categorics and Peri Hermeneias, in the writingof which the great Aristotle is said to have dipped his pen in hisheart's blood.  Passing through these faculties with baneful haste anda harmful diploma, they lay violent hands upon Moses, and sprinklingabout their faces dark waters and thick clouds of the skies, they offertheir heads, unhonoured by the snows of age, for the mitre of thepontificate. This pest is greatly encouraged, and they are helped toattain this fantastic clericate with such nimble steps, by Papalprovisions obtained by insidious prayers, and also by the prayers,which may not be rejected, of cardinals and great men, by the cupidityof friends and relatives, who, building up Sion in blood, secureecclesiastical dignities for their nephews and pupils, before they areseasoned by the course of nature or ripeness of learning."|FALSE
626|"Alas! by the same disease which we are deploring, we see that thePalladium of Paris has been carried off in these sad times of ours,wherein the zeal of that noble university, whose rays once shed lightinto every corner of the world, has grown lukewarm, nay, is all butfrozen.  There the pen of every scribe is now at rest, generations ofbooks no longer succeed each other, and there is none who begins totake place as a new author.  They wrap up their doctrines in unskilleddiscourse, and are losing all propriety of logic, except that ourEnglish subtleties, which they denounce in public, are the subject oftheir furtive vigils."|FALSE

Now she has passed by Paris, and now has happily come toBritain, the most noble of islands, nay, rather a microcosm in itself,that she may show herself a debtor both to the Greeks and to theBarbarians.

626|"OF THE GRADUAL PERFECTING OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"While assiduously seeking out the wisdom of the men of old, accordingto the counsel of the Wise Man (Eccles. xxxix.):  The wise man, hesays, will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients, we have not thoughtfit to be misled into the opinion that the first founders of the artshave purged away all crudeness, knowing that the discoveries of each ofthe faithful, when weighed in a faithful balance, makes a tiny portionof science, but that by the anxious investigations of a multitude ofscholars, each as it were contributing his share, the mighty bodies ofthe sciences have grown by successive augmentations to the immense bulkthat we now behold.  For the disciples, continually melting down thedoctrines of their masters, and passing them again through the furnace,drove off the dross that had been previously overlooked, until therecame out refined gold tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven timesto perfection, and stained by no admixture of error or doubt."|FALSE
626|"For not even Aristotle, although a man of gigantic intellect, in whomit pleased Nature to try how much of reason she could bestow uponmortality, and whom the Most High made only a little lower than theangels, sucked from his own fingers those wonderful volumes which thewhole world can hardly contain.  But, on the contrary, with lynx-eyedpenetration he had seen through the sacred books of the Hebrews, theBabylonians, the Egyptians, the Chaldaeans, the Persians and the Medes,all of which learned Greece had transferred into her treasuries.  Whosetrue sayings he received, but smoothed away their crudities, prunedtheir superfluities, supplied their deficiencies, and removed theirerrors.  And he held that we should give thanks not only to those whoteach rightly, but even to those who err, as affording the way of moreeasily investigating truth, as he plainly declares in the second bookof his Metaphysics.  Thus many learned lawyers contributed to thePandects, many physicians to the Tegni, and it was by this means thatAvicenna edited his Canon, and Pliny his great work on Natural History,and Ptolemy the Almagest."|FALSE
626|"For as in the writers of annals it is not difficult to see that thelater writer always presupposes the earlier, without whom he could byno means relate the former times, so too we are to think of the authorsof the sciences.  For no man by himself has brought forth any science,since between the earliest students and those of the latter time wefind intermediaries, ancient if they be compared with our own age, butmodern if we think of the foundations of learning, and these men weconsider the most learned.  What would Virgil, the chief poet among theLatins, have achieved, if he had not despoiled Theocritus, Lucretius,and Homer, and had not ploughed with their heifer?  What, unless againand again he had read somewhat of Parthenius and Pindar, whoseeloquence he could by no means imitate?  What could Sallust, Tully,Boethius, Macrobius, Lactantius, Martianus, and in short the wholetroop of Latin writers have done, if they had not seen the productionsof Athens or the volumes of the Greeks?  Certes, little would Jerome,master of three languages, Ambrosius, Augustine, though he confessesthat he hated Greek, or even Gregory, who is said to have been whollyignorant of it, have contributed to the doctrine of the Church, if morelearned Greece had not furnished them from its stores.  As Rome,watered by the streams of Greece, had earlier brought forthphilosophers in the image of the Greeks, in like fashion afterwards itproduced doctors of the orthodox faith.  The creeds we chant are thesweat of Grecian brows, promulgated by their Councils, and establishedby the martyrdom of many."|FALSE
626|"Yet their natural slowness, as it happens, turns to the glory of theLatins, since as they were less learned in their studies, so they wereless perverse in their errors.  In truth, the Arian heresy had all buteclipsed the whole Church; the Nestorian wickedness presumed to ravewith blasphemous rage against the Virgin, for it would have robbed theQueen of Heaven, not in open fight but in disputation, of her name andcharacter as Mother of God, unless the invincible champion Cyril, readyto do single battle, with the help of the Council of Ephesus, had invehemence of spirit utterly extinguished it.  Innumerable are the formsas well as the authors of Greek heresies; for as they were the originalcultivators of our holy faith, so too they were the first sowers oftares, as is shown by veracious history.  And thus they went on frombad to worse, because in endeavouring to part the seamless vesture ofthe Lord, they totally destroyed primitive simplicity of doctrine, andblinded by the darkness of novelty would fall into the bottomless pit,unless He provide for them in His inscrutable prerogative, whose wisdomis past reckoning."|FALSE
626|"Let this suffice; for here we reach the limit of our power of judgment.One thing, however, we conclude from the premises, that the ignoranceof the Greek tongue is now a great hindrance to the study of the Latinwriters, since without it the doctrines of the ancient authors, whetherChristian or Gentile, cannot be understood.  And we must come to a likejudgment as to Arabic in numerous astronomical treatises, and as toHebrew as regards the text of the Holy Bible, which deficiencies,indeed, Clement V.  provides for, if only the bishops would faithfullyobserve what they so lightly decree.  Wherefore we have taken care toprovide a Greek as well as a Hebrew grammar for our scholars, withcertain other aids, by the help of which studious readers may greatlyinform themselves in the writing, reading, and understanding of thesaid tongues, although only the hearing of them can teach correctnessof idiom."|FALSE
626|"CHAPTER XI"|FALSE
626|"WHY WE HAVE PREFERRED BOOKS OF LIBERAL LEARNING TO BOOKS OF LAW"|FALSE
626|"That lucrative practice of positive law, designed for the dispensationof earthly things, the more useful it is found by the children of thisworld, so much the less does it aid the children of light incomprehending the mysteries of holy writ and the secret sacraments ofthe faith, seeing that it disposes us peculiarly to the friendship ofthe world, by which man, as S.  James testifies, is made the enemy ofGod.  Law indeed encourages rather than extinguishes the contentions ofmankind, which are the result of unbounded greed, by complicated laws,which can be turned either way; though we know that it was created byjurisconsults and pious princes for the purpose of assuaging thesecontentions.  But in truth, as the same science deals with contraries,and the power of reason can be used to opposite ends, and at the samethe human mind is more inclined to evil, it happens with the practisersof this science that they usually devote themselves to promotingcontention rather than peace, and instead of quoting laws according tothe intent of the legislator, violently strain the language thereof toeffect their own purposes."|FALSE
626|"Wherefore, although the over-mastering love of books has possessed ourmind from boyhood, and to rejoice in their delights has been our onlypleasure, yet the appetite for the books of the civil law took lesshold of our affections, and we have spent but little labour and expensein acquiring volumes of this kind.  For they are useful only as thescorpion in treacle, as Aristotle, the sun of science, has said oflogic in his book De Pomo.  We have noticed a certain manifestdifference of nature between law and science, in that every science isdelighted and desires to open its inward parts and display the veryheart of its principles, and to show forth the roots from which it budsand flourishes, and that the emanation of its springs may be seen ofall men; for thus from the cognate and harmonious light of the truth ofconclusion  to principles, the whole body of science will be full oflight, having no part dark.  But laws, on the contrary, since they areonly human enactments for the regulation of social life, or the yokesof princes thrown over the necks of their subjects, refuse to bebrought to the standard of synteresis, the origin of equity, becausethey feel that they possess more of arbitrary will than rationaljudgment.  Wherefore the judgment of the wise for the most part is thatthe causes of laws are not a fit subject of discussion.  In truth, manylaws acquire force by mere custom, not by syllogistic necessity, likethe arts: as Aristotle, the Phoebus of the Schools, urges in the secondbook of the Politics, where he confutes the policy of Hippodamus, whichholds out rewards to the inventors of new laws, because to abrogate oldlaws and establish new ones is to weaken the force of those whichexist.  For whatever receives its stability from use alone mustnecessarily be brought to nought by disuse."|FALSE
626|"From which it is seen clearly enough, that as laws are neither arts norsciences, so books of law cannot properly be called books of art orscience.  Nor is this faculty which we may call by a special termgeologia, or the earthly science, to be properly numbered among thesciences.  Now the books of the liberal arts are so useful to thedivine writings, that without their aid the intellect would vainlyaspire to understand them."|FALSE

Wherefore we orderedthe meanings of foreign words to be noted with particular care, andstudied the orthography, prosody, etymology, and syntax in ancientgrammarians with unrelaxing carefulness, and took pains to elucidateterms that had grown too obscure by age with suitable explanations, inorder to make a smooth path for our students."|FALSE

626|"Although it is true that all men naturally desire knowledge, yet theydo not all take the same pleasure in learning.  On the contrary, whenthey have experienced the labour of study and find their senseswearied, most men inconsiderately fling away the nut, before they havebroken the shell and reached the kernel.  For man is naturally fond oftwo things, namely, freedom from control and some pleasure in hisactivity; for which reason no one without reason submits himself to thecontrol of others, or willingly engages in any tedious task.  Forpleasure crowns activity, as beauty is a crown to youth, as Aristotletruly asserts in the tenth book of the Ethics.  Accordingly the wisdomof the ancients devised a remedy by which to entice the wanton minds ofmen by a kind of pious fraud, the delicate Minerva secretly lurkingbeneath the mask of pleasure.  We are wont to allure children byrewards, that they may cheerfully learn what we force them to studyeven though they are unwilling.

As now the sayings of the saints frequentlyallude to the inventions of the poets, it must needs happen thatthrough our not knowing the poem referred to, the whole meaning of theauthor is completely obscured, and assuredly, as Cassiodorus says inhis book Of the Institutes of Sacred Literature:  Those things are notto be considered trifles without which great things cannot come topass.

626|"WHO OUGHT TO BE SPECIAL LOVERS OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"To him who recollects what has been said before, it is plain andevident who ought to be the chief lovers of books.  For those who havemost need of wisdom in order to perform usefully the duties of theirposition, they are without doubt most especially bound to show moreabundantly to the sacred vessels of wisdom the anxious affection of agrateful heart.  Now it is the office of the wise man to order rightlyboth himself and others, according to the Phoebus of philosophers,Aristotle, who deceives not nor is deceived in human things.  Whereforeprinces and prelates, judges and doctors, and all other leaders of thecommonwealth, as more than others they have need of wisdom, so morethan others ought they to show zeal for the vessels of wisdom."|FALSE
626|"Boethius, indeed, beheld Philosophy bearing a sceptre in her left handand books in her right, by which it is evidently shown to all men thatno one can rightly rule a commonwealth without books. Thou, saysBoethius, speaking to Philosophy, hast sanctioned this saying by themouth of Plato, that states would be happy if they were ruled bystudents of philosophy, or if their rulers would study philosophy.  Andagain, we are taught by the very gesture of the figure that in so faras the right hand is better than the left, so far the contemplativelife is more worthy than the active life; and at the same time we areshown that the business of the wise man is to devote himself by turns,now to the study of truth, and now to the dispensation of temporalthings."|FALSE

626|"The history of the Greeks as well as Romans shows that there were nofamous princes among them who were devoid of literature.  The sacredlaw of Moses in prescribing to the king a rule of government, enjoinshim to have a copy made of the book of Divine law (Deut. xvii.)according to the copy shown by the priests, in which he was to read allthe days of his life.  Certes, God Himself, who hath made and whofashioneth every day the hearts of every one of us, knows thefeebleness of human memory and the instability of virtuous intentionsin mankind.  Wherefore He has willed that books should be as it were anantidote to all evil, the reading and use of which He has commanded tobe the healthful daily nourishment of the soul, so that by them theintellect being refreshed and neither weak nor doubtful should neverhesitate in action.  This subject is elegantly handled by John ofSalisbury, in his Policraticon.  In conclusion, all classes of men whoare conspicuous by the tonsure or the sign of clerkship, against whombooks lifted up their voices in the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters,are bound to serve books with perpetual veneration."|FALSE

626|"OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE LOVE OF BOOKS"|FALSE
626|"It transcends the power of human intellect, however deeply it may havedrunk of the Pegasean fount, to develop fully the title of the presentchapter.  Though one should speak with the tongue of men and angels,though he should become a Mercury or Tully, though he should grow sweetwith the milky eloquence of Livy, yet he will plead the stammering ofMoses, or with Jeremiah will confess that he is but a boy and cannotspeak, or will imitate Echo rebounding from the mountains.  For we knowthat the love of books is the same thing as the love of wisdom, as wasproved in the second chapter.  Now this love is called by the Greekword philosophy, the whole virtue of which no created intelligence cancomprehend; for she is believed to be the mother of all good things:Wisdom vii.  She as a heavenly dew extinguishes the heats of fleshlyvices, the intense activity of the mental forces relaxing the vigour ofthe animal forces, and slothfulness being wholly put to flight, whichbeing gone all the bows of Cupid are unstrung."|FALSE
626|"Hence Plato says in the Phaedo:  The philosopher is manifest in this,that he dissevers the soul from communion with the body.  Love, saysJerome, the knowledge of the scriptures, and thou wilt not love thevices of the flesh.  The godlike Xenocrates showed this by the firmnessof his reason, who was declared by the famous hetaera Phryne to be astatue and not a man, when all her blandishments could not shake hisresolve, as Valerius Maximus relates at length.  Our own Origen showedthis also, who chose rather to be unsexed by the mutilation of himself,than to be made effeminate by the omnipotence of woman--though it was ahasty remedy, repugnant alike to nature and to virtue, whose place itis not to make men insensible to passion, but to slay with the daggerof reason the passions that spring from instinct."|FALSE

No man, therefore, can serve both books and Mammon."|FALSE
626|"The hideousness of vice is greatly reprobated in books, so that he wholoves to commune with books is led to detest all manner of vice.  Thedemon, who derives his name from knowledge, is most effectuallydefeated by the knowledge of books, and through books his multitudinousdeceits and the endless labyrinths of his guile are laid bare to thosewho read, lest he be transformed into an angel of light and circumventthe innocent by his wiles.  The reverence of God is revealed to us bybooks, the virtues by which He is worshipped are more expresslymanifested, and the rewards are described that are promised by thetruth, which deceives not, neither is deceived.  The truest likeness ofthe beatitude to come is the contemplation of the sacred writings, inwhich we behold in turn the Creator and the creature, and draw fromstreams of perpetual gladness.  Faith is established by the power ofbooks; hope is strengthened by their solace, insomuch that by patienceand the consolation of scripture we are in good hope.  Charity is notpuffed up, but is edified by the knowledge of true learning, and,indeed, it is clearer than light that the Church is established uponthe sacred writings."|FALSE

They lend validity tohuman compacts, and no serious judgments are propounded without theirhelp.  Arts and sciences, all the advantages of which no mind canenumerate, consist in books.  How highly must we estimate the wondrouspower of books, since through them we survey the utmost bounds of theworld and time, and contemplate the things that are as well as thosethat are not, as it were in the mirror of eternity.  In books we climbmountains and scan the deepest gulfs of the abyss; in books we beholdthe finny tribes that may not exist outside their native waters,distinguish the properties of streams and springs and of various lands;from books we dig out gems and metals and the materials of every kindof mineral, and learn the virtues of herbs and trees and plants, andsurvey at will the whole progeny of Neptune, Ceres, and Pluto."|FALSE

When shut up in prison and in bonds,and utterly deprived of bodily liberty, we use books as ambassadors toour friends, and entrust them with the conduct of our cause, and sendthem where to go ourselves would incur the penalty of death.

626|"But because all the appliances of mortal men with the lapse of timesuffer the decay of mortality, it is needful to replace the volumesthat are worn out with age by fresh successors, that the perpetuity ofwhich the individual is by its nature incapable may be secured to thespecies; and hence it is that the Preacher says: Of making many booksthere is no end.  For as the bodies of books, seeing that they areformed of a combination of contrary elements, undergo a continualdissolution of their structure, so by the forethought of the clergy aremedy should be found, by means of which the sacred book paying thedebt of nature may obtain a natural heir and may raise up like seed toits dead brother, and thus may be verified that saying ofEcclesiasticus: His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead;for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.  And thus thetranscription of ancient books is as it were the begetting of freshsons, on whom the office of the father may devolve, lest it sufferdetriment.  Now such transcribers are called antiquarii, whoseoccupations Cassiodorus confesses please him above all the tasks ofbodily labour, adding: \"Happy effort,\" he says, \"laudable industry, topreach to men with the hand, to let loose tongues with the fingers,silently to give salvation to mortals, and to fight with pen and inkagainst the illicit wiles of the Evil One.\"  So far Cassiodorus.Moreover, our Saviour exercised the office of the scribe when Hestooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground (John viii.), thatno one, however exalted, may think it unworthy of him to do what hesees the wisdom of God the Father did."|FALSE

Being dead they cease not toteach, who write books of sacred learning.  Paul did more for buildingup the fabric of the Church by writing his holy epistles, than bypreaching by word of mouth to Jews and Gentiles.

Nor, indeed, dothey deny that the fruits of the earth in that primitive age afforded amore nutritious aliment to men than in our modern times, and thus theyhad not only a livelier energy of body, but also a more lengthenedperiod of vigour; to which it contributed not a little that they livedaccording to virtue and denied themselves all luxurious delights.Whoever therefore is by the good gift of God endowed with gift ofscience, let him, according to the counsel of the Holy Spirit, writewisdom in his time of leisure (Eccles.  xxxviii.), that his reward maybe with the blessed and his days may be lengthened in this presentworld."|FALSE

Julius and Augustus devised means of writing oneletter for another, and so concealing what they wrote.  For Julius putthe fourth letter for the first, and so on through the alphabet; whilstAugustus used the second for the first, the third for the second, andso throughout.  He is said in the greatest difficulties of affairsduring the Mutinensian War to have read and written and even declaimedevery day.  Tiberius wrote a lyric poem and some Greek verses.Claudius likewise was skilled in both Greek and Latin, and wroteseveral books.

And surely next to the vestments andvessels dedicated to the Lord's body, holy books deserve to be rightlytreated by the clergy, to which great injury is done so often as theyare touched by unclean hands.

Would that he had before him no book, but a cobbler'sapron!  His nails are stuffed with fetid filth as black as jet, withwhich he marks any passage that pleases him.  He distributes amultitude of straws, which he inserts to stick out in different places,so that the halm may remind him of what his memory cannot retain.These straws, because the book has no stomach to digest them, and noone takes them out, first distend the book from its wonted closing, andat length, being carelessly abandoned to oblivion, go to decay.  Hedoes not fear to eat fruit or cheese over an open book, or carelesslyto carry a cup to and from his mouth; and because he has no wallet athand he drops into books the fragments that are left.  Continuallychattering, he is never weary of disputing with his companions, andwhile he alleges a crowd of senseless arguments, he wets the book lyinghalf open in his lap with sputtering showers.  Aye, and then hastilyfolding his arms he leans forward on the book, and by a brief spell ofstudy invites a prolonged nap; and then, by way of mending thewrinkles, he folds back the margin of the leaves, to the no smallinjury of the book.  Now the rain is over and gone, and the flowershave appeared in our land.  Then the scholar we are speaking of, aneglecter rather than an inspecter of books, will stuff his volume withviolets, and primroses, with roses and quatrefoil.  Then he will usehis wet and perspiring hands to turn over the volumes; then he willthump the white vellum with gloves covered with all kinds of dust, andwith his finger clad in long-used leather will hunt line by linethrough the page; then at the sting of the biting flea the sacred bookis flung aside, and is hardly shut for another month, until it is sofull of the dust that has found its way within, that it resists theeffort to close it."|FALSE

626|"AN EXHORTATION TO SCHOLARS TO REQUITE US BY PIOUS PRAYERS"|FALSE
626|"Time now clamours for us to terminate this treatise which we havecomposed concerning the love of books; in which we have endeavoured togive the astonishment of our contemporaries the reason why we haveloved books so greatly.  But because it is hardly granted to mortals toaccomplish aught that is not rolled in the dust of vanity, we do notventure entirely to justify the zealous love which we have so long hadfor books, or to deny that it may perchance sometimes have been theoccasion of some venial negligence, albeit the object of our love ishonourable and our intention upright.  For if when we have doneeverything, we are bound to call ourselves unprofitable servants; ifthe most holy Job was afraid of all his works; if according to Isaiahall our righteousness is as filthy rags, who shall presume to boasthimself of the perfection of any virtue, or deny that from somecircumstance a thing may deserve to be reprehended, which in itselfperhaps was not reprehensible.  For good springs from one selfsamesource, but evil arises in many ways, as Dionysius informs us.Wherefore to make amends for our iniquities, by which we acknowledgeourselves to have frequently offended the Creator of all things, inasking the assistance of their prayers, we have thought fit to exhortour future students to show their gratitude as well to us as to theirother benefactors in time to come by requiting our forethought fortheir benefit by spiritual retribution.  Let us live when dead in theirmemories, who have lived in our benevolence before they were born, andlive now sustained by our beneficence.  Let them implore the mercy ofthe Redeemer with unwearied prayer, that the pious Judge may excuse ournegligences, may pardon the wickedness of our sins, may cover thelapses of our feebleness with the cloak of piety, and remit by Hisdivine goodness the offences of which we are ashamed and penitent.That He may preserve to us for a due season of repentance the gifts ofHis good grace, steadfastness of faith, loftiness of hope, and thewidest charity to all men.  That He may turn our haughty will to lamentits faults, that it may deplore its past most vain elations, mayretract its most bitter indignations, and detest its most insanedelectations.  That His virtue may abound in us, when our own is foundwanting, and that He who freely consecrated our beginning by thesacrament of baptism, and advanced our progress to the seat of theApostles without any desert of ours, may deign to fortify our outgoingby the fitting sacraments.  That we may be delivered from the lust ofthe flesh, that the fear of death may utterly vanish and our spirit maydesire to be dissolved and be with Christ, and existing upon earth inbody only, in thought and longing our conversation may be in Heaven.That the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation maygraciously come to meet the prodigal returning from the husks; that Hemay receive the piece of silver that has been lately found and transmitit by His holy angels into His eternal treasury.  That He may rebukewith His terrible countenance, at the hour of our departure, thespirits of darkness, lest Leviathan, that old serpent, lying hid at thegate of death, should spread unforeseen snares for our feet.  But whenwe shall be summoned to the awful judgment-seat to give an account onthe testimony of conscience of all things we have done in the body, theGod-Man may consider the price of the holy blood that He has shed, andthat the Incarnate Deity may note the frame of our carnal nature, thatour weakness may pass unpunished where infinite loving-kindness is tobe found, and that the soul of the wretched sinner may breathe againwhere the peculiar office of the Judge is to show mercy.  And further,let our students be always diligent in invoking the refuge of our hopeafter God, the Virgin Mother of God and Blessed Queen of Heaven, thatwe who for our manifold sins and wickednesses have deserved the angerof the Judge, by the aid of her ever-acceptable supplications may meritHis forgiveness; that her pious hand may depress the scale of thebalance in which our small and few good deeds shall be weighed, lestthe heaviness of our sins preponderate and cast us down to thebottomless pit of perdition.  Moreover, let them ever venerate with dueobservance the most deserving Confessor Cuthbert, the care of whoseflock we have unworthily undertaken, ever devoutly praying that he maydeign to excuse by his prayers his all-unworthy vicar, and may procurehim whom he hath admitted as his successor upon earth to be made hisassessor in Heaven.  Finally, let them pray God with holy prayers aswell of body as of soul, that He will restore the spirit created in theimage of the Trinity, after its sojourn in this miserable world, to itsprimordial prototype, and grant to it for ever to enjoy the sight ofHis countenance: through our Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen."|FALSE
