15707|"The purport of the following pages is an endeavour to reduce the facts"|FALSE
15707|"belonging to ANIMAL LIFE into classes, orders, genera, and species; and, by"|FALSE
15707|"comparing them with each other, to unravel the theory of diseases. It"|FALSE
15707|"happened, perhaps unfortunately for the inquirers into the knowledge of"|FALSE
15707|"diseases, that other sciences had received improvement previous to their"|FALSE
15707|"own; whence, instead of comparing the properties belonging to animated"|FALSE
15707|"nature with each other, they, idly ingenious, busied themselves in"|FALSE
15707|"attempting to explain the laws of life by those of mechanism and chemistry;"|FALSE
15707|"they considered the body as an hydraulic machine, and the fluids as passing"|FALSE
15707|"through a series of chemical changes, forgetting that animation was its"|FALSE
15707|"essential characteristic."|FALSE
15707|"The great CREATOR of all things has infinitely diversified the works of his"|FALSE
15707|"hands, but has at the same time stamped a certain similitude on the"|FALSE
15707|"features of nature, that demonstrates to us, that _the whole is one family"|FALSE
15707|"of one parent_. On this similitude is founded all rational analogy; which,"|FALSE
15707|"so long as it is concerned in comparing the essential properties of bodies,"|FALSE
15707|"leads us to many and important discoveries; but when with licentious"|FALSE
15707|"activity it links together objects, otherwise discordant, by some fanciful"|FALSE
15707|"similitude; it may indeed collect ornaments for wit and poetry, but"|FALSE
15707|"philosophy and truth recoil from its combinations."|FALSE
15707|"The want of a theory, deduced from such strict analogy, to conduct the"|FALSE
15707|"practice of medicine is lamented by its professors; for, as a great number"|FALSE
15707|"of unconnected facts are difficult to be acquired, and to be reasoned from,"|FALSE
15707|"the art of medicine is in many instances less efficacious under the"|FALSE
15707|"direction of its wisest practitioners; and by that busy crowd, who either"|FALSE
15707|"boldly wade in darkness, or are led into endless error by the glare of"|FALSE
15707|"false theory, it is daily practised to the destruction of thousands; add to"|FALSE
15707|"this the unceasing injury which accrues to the public by the perpetual"|FALSE
15707|"advertisements of pretended nostrums; the minds of the indolent become"|FALSE
15707|"superstitiously fearful of diseases, which they do not labour under; and"|FALSE
15707|"thus become the daily prey of some crafty empyric."|FALSE
15707|"A theory founded upon nature, that should bind together the scattered facts"|FALSE
15707|"of medical knowledge, and converge into one point of view the laws of"|FALSE
15707|"organic life, would thus on many accounts contribute to the interest of"|FALSE
15707|"society. It would capacitate men of moderate abilities to practise the art"|FALSE
15707|"of healing with real advantage to the public; it would enable every one of"|FALSE
15707|"literary acquirements to distinguish the genuine disciples of medicine from"|FALSE
15707|"those of boastful effrontery, or of wily address; and would teach mankind"|FALSE
15707|"in some important situations the _knowledge of themselves_."|FALSE
15707|"There are some modern practitioners, who declaim against medical theory in"|FALSE
15707|"general, not considering that to think is to theorize; and that no one can"|FALSE
15707|"direct a method of cure to a person labouring under disease without"|FALSE
15707|"thinking, that is, without theorizing; and happy therefore is the patient,"|FALSE
15707|"whose physician possesses the best theory."|FALSE
15707|"The words idea, perception, sensation, recollection, suggestion, and"|FALSE
15707|"association, are each of them used in this treatise in a more limited sense"|FALSE
15707|"than in the writers of metaphysic. The author was in doubt, whether he"|FALSE
15707|"should rather have substituted new words instead of them; but was at length"|FALSE
15707|"of opinion, that new definitions of words already in use would be less"|FALSE
15707|"burthensome to the memory of the reader."|FALSE
15707|"A great part of this work has lain by the writer above twenty years, as"|FALSE
15707|"some of his friends can testify: he had hoped by frequent revision to have"|FALSE
15707|"made it more worthy the acceptance of the public; this however his other"|FALSE
15707|"perpetual occupations have in part prevented, and may continue to prevent,"|FALSE
15707|"as long as he may be capable of revising it; he therefore begs of the"|FALSE
15707|"candid reader to accept of it in its present state, and to excuse any"|FALSE
15707|"inaccuracies of expression, or of conclusion, into which the intricacy of"|FALSE
15707|"his subject, the general imperfection of language, or the frailty he has in"|FALSE

15707|"OF MOTION."|FALSE
15707|"The whole of nature may be supposed to consist of two essences or"|FALSE
15707|"substances; one of which may be termed spirit, and the other matter. The"|FALSE
15707|"former of these possesses the power to commence or produce motion, and the"|FALSE
15707|"latter to receive and communicate it. So that motion, considered as a"|FALSE
15707|"cause, immediately precedes every effect; and, considered as an effect, it"|FALSE
15707|"immediately succeeds every cause."|FALSE
15707|"The MOTIONS OF MATTER may be divided into two kinds, primary and secondary."|FALSE
15707|"The secondary motions are those, which are given to or received from other"|FALSE
15707|"matter in motion. Their laws have been successfully investigated by"|FALSE
15707|"philosophers in their treatises on mechanic powers. These motions are"|FALSE
15707|"distinguished by this circumstance, that the velocity multiplied into the"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of matter of the body acted upon is equal to the velocity"|FALSE
15707|"multiplied into the quantity of matter of the acting body."|FALSE
15707|"The primary motions of matter may be divided into three classes, those"|FALSE
15707|"belonging to gravitation, to chemistry, and to life; and each class has its"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar laws. Though these three classes include the motions of solid,"|FALSE
15707|"liquid, and aerial bodies; there is nevertheless a fourth division of"|FALSE
15707|"motions; I mean those of the supposed ethereal fluids of magnetism,"|FALSE
15707|"electricity, heat, and light; whose properties are not so well investigated"|FALSE
15707|"as to be classed with sufficient accuracy."|FALSE
15707|"_1st._ The gravitating motions include the annual and diurnal rotation of"|FALSE
15707|"the earth and planets, the flux and reflux of the ocean, the descent of"|FALSE
15707|"heavy bodies, and other phænomena of gravitation. The unparalleled sagacity"|FALSE
15707|"of the great NEWTON has deduced the laws of this class of motions from the"|FALSE
15707|"simple principle of the general attraction of matter. These motions are"|FALSE
15707|"distinguished by their tendency to or from the centers of the sun or"|FALSE
15707|"planets."|FALSE
15707|"_2d._ The chemical class of motions includes all the various appearances of"|FALSE
15707|"chemistry. Many of the facts, which belong to these branches of science,"|FALSE
15707|"are nicely ascertained, and elegantly classed; but their laws have not yet"|FALSE
15707|"been developed from such simple principles as those above-mentioned; though"|FALSE
15707|"it is probable, that they depend on the specific attractions belonging to"|FALSE
15707|"the particles of bodies, or to the difference of the quantity of attraction"|FALSE
15707|"belonging to the sides and angles of those particles. The chemical motions"|FALSE
15707|"are distinguished by their being generally attended with an evident"|FALSE
15707|"decomposition or new combination of the active materials."|FALSE
15707|"_3d._ The third class includes all the motions of the animal and vegetable"|FALSE

15707|"contractions move the bones of the limbs and trunk, to which their"|FALSE
15707|"extremities are attached. The annular or spiral muscular fibres compose the"|FALSE
15707|"vascular muscles, which constitute the intestinal canal, the arteries,"|FALSE
15707|"veins, glands, and absorbent vessels."|FALSE
15707|"3. The immediate organs of sense, as the retina of the eye, probably"|FALSE
15707|"consist of moving fibrils, with a power of contraction similar to that of"|FALSE
15707|"the larger muscles above described."|FALSE
15707|"4. The cellular membrane consists of cells, which resemble those of a"|FALSE
15707|"sponge, communicating with each other, and connecting together all the"|FALSE
15707|"other parts of the body."|FALSE
15707|"5. The arterial system consists of the aortal and the pulmonary artery,"|FALSE
15707|"which are attended through their whole course with their correspondent"|FALSE
15707|"veins. The pulmonary artery receives the blood from the right chamber of"|FALSE
15707|"the heart, and carries it to the minute extensive ramifications of the"|FALSE
15707|"lungs, where it is exposed to the action of the air on a surface equal to"|FALSE
15707|"that of the whole external skin, through the thin moist coats of those"|FALSE
15707|"vessels, which are spread on the air-cells, which constitute the minute"|FALSE
15707|"terminal ramifications of the wind-pipe. Here the blood changes its colour"|FALSE
15707|"from a dark red to a bright scarlet. It is then collected by the branches"|FALSE
15707|"of the pulmonary vein, and conveyed to the left chamber of the heart."|FALSE
15707|"6. The aorta is another large artery, which receives the blood from the"|FALSE
15707|"left chamber of the heart, after it has been thus aerated in the lungs, and"|FALSE
15707|"conveys it by ascending and descending branches to every other part of the"|FALSE
15707|"system; the extremities of this artery terminate either in glands, as the"|FALSE
15707|"salivary glands, lacrymal glands, &c. or in capillary vessels, which are"|FALSE
15707|"probably less involuted glands; in these some fluid, as saliva, tears,"|FALSE
15707|"perspiration, are separated from the blood; and the remainder of the blood"|FALSE
15707|"is absorbed or drank up by branches of veins correspondent to the branches"|FALSE
15707|"of the artery; which are furnished with valves to prevent its return; and"|FALSE
15707|"is thus carried back, after having again changed its colour to a dark red,"|FALSE
15707|"to the right chamber of the heart. The circulation of the blood in the"|FALSE
15707|"liver differs from this general system; for the veins which drink up the"|FALSE
15707|"refluent blood from those arteries, which are spread on the bowels and"|FALSE
15707|"mesentery, unite into a trunk in the liver, and form a kind of artery,"|FALSE
15707|"which is branched into the whole substance of the liver, and is called the"|FALSE
15707|"vena portarum; and from which the bile is separated by the numerous hepatic"|FALSE
15707|"glands, which constitute that viscus."|FALSE
15707|"7. The glands may be divided into three systems, the convoluted glands,"|FALSE
15707|"such as those above described, which separate bile, tears, saliva, &c."|FALSE
15707|"Secondly, the glands without convolution, as the capillary vessels, which"|FALSE
15707|"unite the terminations of the arteries and veins; and separate both the"|FALSE
15707|"mucus, which lubricates the cellular membrane, and the perspirable matter,"|FALSE
15707|"which preserves the skin moist and flexible. And thirdly, the whole"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent system, consisting of the lacteals, which open their mouths into"|FALSE
15707|"the stomach and intestines, and of the lymphatics, which open their mouths"|FALSE
15707|"on the external surface of the body, and on the internal linings of all the"|FALSE
15707|"cells of the cellular membrane, and other cavities of the body."|FALSE
15707|"These lacteal and lymphatic vessels are furnished with numerous valves to"|FALSE
15707|"prevent the return of the fluids, which they absorb, and terminate in"|FALSE
15707|"glands, called lymphatic glands, and may hence be considered as long necks"|FALSE
15707|"or mouths belonging to these glands. To these they convey the chyle and"|FALSE
15707|"mucus, with a part of the perspirable matter, and atmospheric moisture; all"|FALSE
15707|"which, after having passed through these glands, and having suffered some"|FALSE
15707|"change in them, are carried forward into the blood, and supply perpetual"|FALSE
15707|"nourishment to the system, or replace its hourly waste."|FALSE
15707|"8. The stomach and intestinal canal have a constant vermicular motion,"|FALSE
15707|"which carries forwards their contents, after the lacteals have drank up the"|FALSE
15707|"chyle from them; and which is excited into action by the stimulus of the"|FALSE
15707|"aliment we swallow, but which becomes occasionally inverted or retrograde,"|FALSE
15707|"as in vomiting, and in the iliac passion."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The word _sensorium_ in the following pages is designed to express"|FALSE
15707|"not only the medullary part of the brain, spinal marrow, nerves, organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense, and of the muscles; but also at the same time that living principle,"|FALSE
15707|"or spirit of animation, which resides throughout the body, without being"|FALSE
15707|"cognizable to our senses, except by its effects. The changes which"|FALSE
15707|"occasionally take place in the sensorium, as during the exertions of"|FALSE
15707|"volition, or the sensations of pleasure or pain, are termed _sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"motions_."|FALSE
15707|"2. The similarity of the texture of the brain to that of the pancreas, and"|FALSE
15707|"some other glands of the body, has induced the inquirers into this subject"|FALSE
15707|"to believe, that a fluid, perhaps much more subtile than the electric aura,"|FALSE
15707|"is separated from the blood by that organ for the purposes of motion and"|FALSE
15707|"sensation. When we recollect, that the electric fluid itself is actually"|FALSE
15707|"accumulated and given out voluntarily by the torpedo and the gymnotus"|FALSE
15707|"electricus, that an electric shock will frequently stimulate into motion a"|FALSE
15707|"paralytic limb, and lastly that it needs no perceptible tubes to convey it,"|FALSE
15707|"this opinion seems not without probability; and the singular figure of the"|FALSE
15707|"brain and nervous system seems well adapted to distribute it over every"|FALSE
15707|"part of the body."|FALSE
15707|"For the medullary substance of the brain not only occupies the cavities of"|FALSE
15707|"the head and spine, but passes along the innumerable ramifications of the"|FALSE
15707|"nerves to the various muscles and organs of sense. In these it lays aside"|FALSE
15707|"its coverings, and is intermixed with the slender fibres, which constitute"|FALSE
15707|"those muscles and organs of sense. Thus all these distant ramifications of"|FALSE
15707|"the sensorium are united at one of their extremities, that is, in the head"|FALSE
15707|"and spine; and thus these central parts of the sensorium constitute a"|FALSE
15707|"communication between all the organs of sense and muscles."|FALSE
15707|"3. A _nerve_ is a continuation of the medullary substance of the brain from"|FALSE
15707|"the head or spine towards the other parts of the body, wrapped in its"|FALSE
15707|"proper membrane."|FALSE
15707|"4. The _muscular fibres_ are moving organs intermixed with that medullary"|FALSE
15707|"substance, which is continued along the nerves, as mentioned above. They"|FALSE
15707|"are indued with the power of contraction, and are again elongated either by"|FALSE
15707|"antagonist muscles, by circulating fluids, or by elastic ligaments. So the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles on one side of the forearm bend the fingers by means of their"|FALSE
15707|"tendons, and those on the other side of the fore-arm extend them again. The"|FALSE
15707|"arteries are distended by the circulating blood; and in the necks of"|FALSE
15707|"quadrupeds there is a strong elastic ligament, which assists the muscles,"|FALSE
15707|"which elevate the head, to keep it in its horizontal position, and to raise"|FALSE
15707|"it after it has been depressed."|FALSE
15707|"5. The _immediate organs of sense_ consist in like manner of moving fibres"|FALSE
15707|"enveloped in the medullary substance above mentioned; and are erroneously"|FALSE
15707|"supposed to be simply an expansion of the nervous medulla, as the retina of"|FALSE
15707|"the eye, and the rete mucosum of the skin, which are the immediate organs"|FALSE
15707|"of vision, and of touch. Hence when we speak of the contractions of the"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous parts of the body, we shall mean both the contractions of the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles, and those of the immediate organs of sense. These _fibrous"|FALSE
15707|"motions_ are thus distinguished from the _sensorial motions_ above"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned."|FALSE
15707|"6. The _external organs_ of sense are the coverings of the immediate organs"|FALSE
15707|"of sense, and are mechanically adapted for the reception or transmission of"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar bodies, or of their qualities, as the cornea and humours of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye, the tympanum of the ear, the cuticle of the finders and tongue."|FALSE
15707|"7. The word _idea_ has various meanings in the writers of metaphysic: it is"|FALSE
15707|"here used simply for those notions of external things, which our organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense bring us acquainted with originally; and is defined a contraction, or"|FALSE
15707|"motion, or configuration, of the fibres, which constitute the immediate"|FALSE
15707|"organ of sense; which will be explained at large in another part of the"|FALSE
15707|"work. Synonymous with the word idea, we shall sometimes use the words"|FALSE
15707|"_sensual motion_ in contradistinction to _muscular motion_."|FALSE
15707|"8. The word _perception_ includes both the action of the organ of sense in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of the impact of external objects, and our attention to that"|FALSE
15707|"action; that is, it expresses both the motion of the organ of sense, or"|FALSE
15707|"idea, and the pain or pleasure that succeeds or accompanies it."|FALSE
15707|"9. The pleasure or pain which necessarily accompanies all those perceptions"|FALSE
15707|"or ideas which we attend to, either gradually subsides, or is succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"other fibrous motions. In the latter case it is termed _sensation_, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. V. 2, and VI. 2.--The reader is intreated to keep this"|FALSE
15707|"in his mind, that through all this treatise the word sensation is used to"|FALSE
15707|"express pleasure or pain only in its active state, by whatever means it is"|FALSE
15707|"introduced into the system, without any reference to the stimulation of"|FALSE
15707|"external objects."|FALSE
15707|"10. The vulgar use of the word _memory_ is too unlimited for our purpose:"|FALSE
15707|"those ideas which we voluntarily recall are here termed ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"_recollection_, as when we will to repeat the alphabet backwards. And those"|FALSE
15707|"ideas which are suggested to us by preceding ideas are here termed ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"_suggestion_, as whilst we repeat the alphabet in the usual order; when by"|FALSE
15707|"habits previously acquired B is suggested by A, and C by B, without any"|FALSE
15707|"effort of deliberation."|FALSE
15707|"11. The word _association_ properly signifies a society or convention of"|FALSE
15707|"things in some respects similar to each other. We never say in common"|FALSE
15707|"language, that the effect is associated with the cause, though they"|FALSE
15707|"necessarily accompany or succeed each other. Thus the contractions of our"|FALSE
15707|"muscles and organs of sense may be said to be associated together, but"|FALSE
15707|"cannot with propriety be said to be associated with irritations, or with"|FALSE
15707|"volition, or with sensation; because they are caused by them, as mentioned"|FALSE
15707|"in Sect. IV. When fibrous contractions succeed other fibrous contractions,"|FALSE
15707|"the connection is termed _association_; when fibrous contractions succeed"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial motions, the connection is termed _causation_; when fibrous and"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial motions reciprocally introduce each other in progressive trains"|FALSE
15707|"or tribes, it is termed _catenation_ of animal motions. All these"|FALSE
15707|"connections are said to be produced by _habit_; that is, by frequent"|FALSE
15707|"repetition."|FALSE
15707|"12. It may be proper to observe, that by the unavoidable idiom of our"|FALSE
15707|"language the ideas of perception, of recollection, or of imagination, in"|FALSE
15707|"the plural number signify the ideas belonging to perception, to"|FALSE
15707|"recollection, or to imagination; whilst the idea of perception, of"|FALSE
15707|"recollection, or of imagination, in the singular number is used for what is"|FALSE
15707|"termed \"a reflex idea of any of those operations of the sensorium.\""|FALSE
15707|"13. By the word _stimulus_ is not only meant the application of external"|FALSE
15707|"bodies to our organs of sense and muscular fibres, which excites into"|FALSE
15707|"action the sensorial power termed irritation; but also pleasure or pain,"|FALSE
15707|"when they excite into action the sensorial power termed sensation; and"|FALSE
15707|"desire or aversion, when they excite into action the power of volition; and"|FALSE
15707|"lastly, the fibrous contractions which precede association; as is further"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XII. 2. 1."|FALSE

15707|"unconquered field of science, by removing some obstacles which thwart our"|FALSE
15707|"passage. I. To demonstrate that the retina and other immediate organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense possess a power of motion, and that these motions constitute our"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, according to the fifth and seventh of the preceding assertions,"|FALSE
15707|"claims our first attention."|FALSE
15707|"Animal motions are distinguished from the communicated motions, mentioned"|FALSE
15707|"in the first section, as they have no mechanical proportion to their cause;"|FALSE
15707|"for the goad of a spur on the skin of a horse shall induce him to move a"|FALSE
15707|"load of hay. They differ from the gravitating motions there mentioned as"|FALSE
15707|"they are exerted with equal facility in all directions, and they differ"|FALSE
15707|"from the chemical class of motions, because no apparent decompositions or"|FALSE
15707|"new combinations are produced in the moving materials."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, when we say animal motion is excited by irritation, we do not mean"|FALSE
15707|"that the motion bears any proportion to the mechanical impulse of the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus; nor that it is affected by the general gravitation of the two"|FALSE
15707|"bodies; nor by their chemical properties, but solely that certain animal"|FALSE
15707|"fibres are excited into action by something external to the moving organ."|FALSE
15707|"In this sense the stimulus of the blood produces the contractions of the"|FALSE
15707|"heart; and the substances we take into our stomach and bowels stimulate"|FALSE
15707|"them to perform their necessary functions. The rays of light excite the"|FALSE
15707|"retina into animal motion by their stimulus; at the same time that those"|FALSE
15707|"rays of light themselves are physically converged to a focus by the"|FALSE
15707|"inactive humours of the eye. The vibrations of the air stimulate the"|FALSE
15707|"auditory nerve into animal action; while it is probable that the tympanum"|FALSE
15707|"of the ear at the same time undergoes a mechanical vibration."|FALSE
15707|"To render this circumstance more easy to be comprehended, _motion may be"|FALSE
15707|"defined to be a variation of figure_; for the whole universe may be"|FALSE
15707|"considered as one thing possessing a certain figure; the motions of any of"|FALSE
15707|"its parts are a variation of this figure of the whole: this definition of"|FALSE
15707|"motion will be further explained in Section XIV. 2. 2. on the production of"|FALSE
15707|"ideas."|FALSE
15707|"Now the motions of an organ of sense are a succession of configurations of"|FALSE
15707|"that organ; these configurations succeed each other quicker or slower; and"|FALSE
15707|"whatever configuration of this organ of sense, that is, whatever portion of"|FALSE
15707|"the motion of it is, or has usually been, attended to, constitutes an idea."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the configuration is not to be considered as an effect of the motion"|FALSE
15707|"of the organ, but rather as a part or temporary termination of it; and"|FALSE
15707|"that, whether a pause succeeds it, or a new configuration immediately takes"|FALSE
15707|"place. Thus when a succession of moving objects are presented to our view,"|FALSE
15707|"the ideas of trumpets, horns, lords and ladies, trains and canopies, are"|FALSE
15707|"configurations, that is, parts or links of the successive motions of the"|FALSE
15707|"organ of vision."|FALSE
15707|"[Illustration: Plate I.]"|FALSE
15707|"These motions or configurations of the organs of sense differ from the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial motions to be described hereafter, as they appear to be simply"|FALSE
15707|"contractions of the fibrous extremities of those organs, and in that"|FALSE
15707|"respect exactly resemble the motions or contractions of the larger muscles,"|FALSE
15707|"as appears from the following experiment. Place a circular piece of red"|FALSE
15707|"silk about an inch in diameter on a sheet of white paper in a strong light,"|FALSE
15707|"as in Plate I.--look for a minute on this area, or till the eye becomes"|FALSE
15707|"somewhat fatigued, and then, gently closing your eyes, and shading them"|FALSE
15707|"with your hand, a circular green area of the same apparent diameter becomes"|FALSE
15707|"visible in the closed eye. This green area is the colour reverse to the red"|FALSE
15707|"area, which had been previously inspected, as explained in the experiments"|FALSE
15707|"on ocular spectra at the end of the work, and in Botanical Garden, P. 1."|FALSE
15707|"additional note, No. 1. Hence it appears, that a part of the retina, which"|FALSE
15707|"had been fatigued by contraction in one direction, relieves itself by"|FALSE
15707|"exerting the antagonist fibres, and producing a contraction in an opposite"|FALSE
15707|"direction, as is common in the exertions of our muscles. Thus when we are"|FALSE
15707|"tired with long action of our arms in one direction, as in holding a bridle"|FALSE
15707|"on a journey, we occasionally throw them into an opposite position to"|FALSE
15707|"relieve the fatigued muscles."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. Locke has defined an idea to be \"whatever is present to the mind;\" but"|FALSE
15707|"this would include the exertions of volition, and the sensations of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure and pain, as well as those operations of our system, which"|FALSE
15707|"acquaint us with external objects; and is therefore too unlimited for our"|FALSE
15707|"purpose. Mr. Lock seems to have fallen into a further error, by conceiving,"|FALSE
15707|"that the mind could form a general or abstract idea by its own operation,"|FALSE
15707|"which was the copy of no particular perception; as of a triangle in"|FALSE
15707|"general, that was neither acute, obtuse, nor right angled. The ingenious"|FALSE
15707|"Dr. Berkley and Mr. Hume have demonstrated, that such general ideas have no"|FALSE
15707|"existence in nature, not even in the mind of their celebrated inventor. We"|FALSE
15707|"shall therefore take for granted at present, that our recollection or"|FALSE
15707|"imagination of external objects consists of a partial repetition of the"|FALSE
15707|"perceptions, which were excited by those external objects, at the time we"|FALSE
15707|"became acquainted with them; and that our reflex ideas of the operations of"|FALSE
15707|"our minds are partial repetitions of those operations."|FALSE
15707|"II. The following article evinces that the organ of vision consists of a"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous part as well as of the nervous medulla, like other white muscles;"|FALSE
15707|"and hence, as it resembles the muscular parts of the body in its structure,"|FALSE
15707|"we may conclude, that it must resemble them in possessing a power of being"|FALSE
15707|"excited into animal motion.--The subsequent experiments on the optic nerve,"|FALSE
15707|"and on the colours remaining in the eye, are copied from a paper on ocular"|FALSE
15707|"spectra published in the seventy-sixth volume of the Philos. Trans. by Dr."|FALSE
15707|"R. Darwin of Shrewsbury; which, as I shall have frequent occasion to refer"|FALSE
15707|"to, is reprinted in this work, Sect. XL. The retina of an ox's eye was"|FALSE
15707|"suspended in a glass of warm water, and forcibly torn in a few places; the"|FALSE
15707|"edges of these parts appeared jagged and hairy, and did not contract and"|FALSE
15707|"become smooth like simple mucus, when it is distended till it breaks; which"|FALSE
15707|"evinced that it consisted of fibres. This fibrous construction became still"|FALSE
15707|"more distinct to the light by adding some caustic alcali to the water; as"|FALSE
15707|"the adhering mucus was first eroded, and the hair-like fibres remained"|FALSE
15707|"floating in the vessel. Nor does the degree of transparency of the retina"|FALSE
15707|"invalidate this evidence of its fibrous structure, since Leeuwenhoek has"|FALSE
15707|"shewn, that the crystalline humour itself consists of fibres. Arc. Nat. V."|FALSE
15707|"I. 70."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, that as the muscles consist of larger fibres intermixed"|FALSE
15707|"with a smaller quantity of nervous medulla, the organ of vision consists of"|FALSE
15707|"a greater quantity of nervous medulla intermixed with smaller fibres. It is"|FALSE
15707|"probable that the locomotive muscles of microscopic animals may have"|FALSE
15707|"greater tenuity than these of the retina; and there is reason to conclude"|FALSE
15707|"from analogy, that the other immediate organs of sense, as the portio"|FALSE
15707|"mollis of the auditory nerve, and the rete mucosum of the skin, possess a"|FALSE
15707|"similarity of structure with the retina, and a similar power of being"|FALSE
15707|"excited into animal motion."|FALSE
15707|"III. The subsequent articles shew, that neither mechanical impressions, nor"|FALSE
15707|"chemical combinations of light, but that the animal activity of the retina"|FALSE
15707|"constitutes vision."|FALSE
15707|"1. Much has been conjectured by philosophers about the momentum of the rays"|FALSE
15707|"of light; to subject this to experiment a very light horizontal balance was"|FALSE
15707|"constructed by Mr. Michel, with about an inch square of thin leaf-copper"|FALSE
15707|"suspended at each end of it, as described in Dr. Priestley's History of"|FALSE
15707|"Light and Colours. The focus of a very large convex mirror was thrown by"|FALSE
15707|"Dr. Powel, in his lectures on experimental philosophy, in my presence, on"|FALSE
15707|"one wing of this delicate balance, and it receded from the light; thrown on"|FALSE
15707|"the other wing, it approached towards the light, and this repeatedly; so"|FALSE
15707|"that no sensible impulse could be observed, but what might well be ascribed"|FALSE
15707|"to the ascent of heated air."|FALSE
15707|"Whence it is reasonable to conclude, that the light of the day must be much"|FALSE
15707|"too weak in its dilute state to make any mechanical impression on so"|FALSE
15707|"tenacious a substance as the retina of the eye.--Add to this, that as the"|FALSE
15707|"retina is nearly transparent, it could therefore make less resistance to"|FALSE
15707|"the mechanical impulse of light; which, according, to the observations"|FALSE
15707|"related by Mr. Melvil in the Edinburgh Literary Essays, only communicates"|FALSE
15707|"heat, and should therefore only communicate momentum, where it is"|FALSE
15707|"obstructed, reflected, or refracted.--From whence also may be collected the"|FALSE
15707|"final cause of this degree of transparency of the retina, viz. left by the"|FALSE
15707|"focus of stronger lights, heat and pain should have been produced in the"|FALSE
15707|"retina, instead of that stimulus which excites it into animal motion."|FALSE
15707|"2. On looking long on an area of scarlet silk of about an inch in diameter"|FALSE
15707|"laid on white paper, as in Plate I. the scarlet colour becomes fainter,"|FALSE
15707|"till at length it entirely vanishes, though the eye is kept uniformly and"|FALSE
15707|"steadily upon it. Now if the change or motion of the retina was a"|FALSE
15707|"mechanical impression, or a chemical tinge of coloured light, the"|FALSE
15707|"perception would every minute become stronger and stronger,--whereas in"|FALSE
15707|"this experiment it becomes every instant weaker and weaker. The same"|FALSE
15707|"circumstance obtains in the continued application of sound, or of sapid"|FALSE
15707|"bodies, or of odorous ones, or of tangible ones, to their adapted organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense."|FALSE
15707|"[Illustration: Plate II.]"|FALSE
15707|"Thus when a circular coin, as a shilling, is pressed on the palm of the"|FALSE
15707|"hand, the sense of touch is mechanically compressed; but it is the stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"of this pressure that excites the organ of touch into animal action, which"|FALSE
15707|"constitutes the perception of hardness and of figure; for in some minutes"|FALSE
15707|"the perception ceases, though the mechanical pressure of the object"|FALSE
15707|"remains."|FALSE
15707|"3. Make with ink on white paper a very black spot about half an inch in"|FALSE
15707|"diameter, with a tail about an inch in length, so as to resemble a tadpole,"|FALSE
15707|"as in Plate II.; look steadfastly for a minute on the center of this spot,"|FALSE
15707|"and, on moving the eye a little, the figure of the tadpole will be seen on"|FALSE
15707|"the white part of the paper; which figure of the tadpole will appear more"|FALSE
15707|"luminous than the other part of the white paper; which can only be"|FALSE
15707|"explained by supposing that a part of the retina, on which the tadpole was"|FALSE
15707|"delineated, to have become more sensible to light than the other parts of"|FALSE
15707|"it, which were exposed to the white paper; and not from any idea of"|FALSE
15707|"mechanical impression or chemical combination of light with the retina."|FALSE
15707|"4. When any one turns round rapidly, till he becomes dizzy, and falls upon"|FALSE
15707|"the ground, the spectra of the ambient objects continue to present"|FALSE
15707|"themselves in rotation, and he seems to behold the objects still in motion."|FALSE
15707|"Now if these spectra were impressions on a passive organ, they either must"|FALSE
15707|"continue as they were received last, or not continue at all."|FALSE
15707|"5. Place a piece of red silk about an inch in diameter on a sheet of white"|FALSE
15707|"paper in a strong light, as in Plate I; look steadily upon it from the"|FALSE
15707|"distance of about half a yard for a minute; then closing your eye-lids,"|FALSE
15707|"cover them with your hands and handkerchief, and a green spectrum will be"|FALSE
15707|"seen in your eyes resembling in form the piece of red silk. After some"|FALSE
15707|"seconds of time the spectrum will disappear, and in a few more seconds will"|FALSE
15707|"reappear; and thus alternately three or four times, if the experiment be"|FALSE
15707|"well made, till at length it vanishes entirely."|FALSE
15707|"[Illustration: Plate III.]"|FALSE
15707|"6. Place a circular piece of white paper, about four inches in diameter, in"|FALSE
15707|"the sunshine, cover the center of this with a circular piece of black silk,"|FALSE
15707|"about three inches in diameter; and the center of the black silk with a"|FALSE
15707|"circle of pink silk, about two inches in diameter; and the center of the"|FALSE
15707|"pink silk with a circle of yellow silk, about one inch in diameter; and the"|FALSE
15707|"center of this with a circle of blue silk, about half an inch in diameter;"|FALSE
15707|"make a small spot with ink in the center of the blue silk, as in Plate"|FALSE
15707|"III.; look steadily for a minute on this central spot, and then closing"|FALSE
15707|"your eyes, and applying your hand at about an inch distance before them, so"|FALSE
15707|"as to prevent too much or too little light from passing through the"|FALSE
15707|"eye-lids, and you will see the most beautiful circles of colours that"|FALSE
15707|"imagination can conceive; which are most resembled by the colours"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned by pouring a drop or two of oil on a still lake in a bright day."|FALSE
15707|"But these circular irises of colours are not only different from the"|FALSE
15707|"colours of the silks above mentioned, but are at the same time perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"changing as long as they exist."|FALSE
15707|"From all these experiments it appears, that these spectra in the eye are"|FALSE
15707|"not owing to the mechanical impulse of light impressed on the retina; nor"|FALSE
15707|"to its chemical combination with that organ; nor to the absorption and"|FALSE
15707|"emission of light, as is supposed, perhaps erroneously, to take place in"|FALSE
15707|"calcined shells and other phosphorescent bodies, after having been exposed"|FALSE
15707|"to the light: for in all these cases the spectra in the eye should either"|FALSE
15707|"remain of the same colour, or gradually decay, when the object is"|FALSE
15707|"withdrawn; and neither their evanescence during the presence of their"|FALSE
15707|"object, as in the second experiment, nor their change from dark to"|FALSE
15707|"luminous, as in the third experiment, nor their rotation, as in the fourth"|FALSE
15707|"experiment, nor the alternate presence and evanescence of them, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"fifth experiment, nor the perpetual change of colours of them, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"last experiment, could exist."|FALSE
15707|"IV. The subsequent articles shew, that these animal motions or"|FALSE
15707|"configurations of our organs of sense constitute our ideas."|FALSE
15707|"1. If any one in the dark presses the ball of his eye, by applying his"|FALSE
15707|"finger to the external corner of it, a luminous appearance is observed; and"|FALSE
15707|"by a smart stroke on the eye great slashes of fire are perceived. (Newton's"|FALSE
15707|"Optics.) So that when the arteries, that are near the auditory nerve, make"|FALSE
15707|"stronger pulsations than usual, as in some fevers, an undulating sound is"|FALSE
15707|"excited in the ears. Hence it is not the presence of the light and sound,"|FALSE
15707|"but the motions of the organ, that are immediately necessary to constitute"|FALSE
15707|"the perception or idea of light and sound."|FALSE
15707|"2. During the time of sleep, or in delirium, the ideas of imagination are"|FALSE
15707|"mistaken for the perceptions of external objects; whence it appears, that"|FALSE
15707|"these ideas of imagination, are no other than a reiteration of those"|FALSE
15707|"motions of the organs of sense, which were originally excited by the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of external objects: and in our waking hours the simple ideas,"|FALSE
15707|"that we call up by recollection or by imagination, as the colour of red, or"|FALSE
15707|"the smell of a rose, are exact resemblances of the same simple ideas from"|FALSE
15707|"perception; and in consequence must be a repetition of those very motions."|FALSE
15707|"3. The disagreeable sensation called the tooth-edge is originally excited"|FALSE
15707|"by the painful jarring of the teeth in biting the edge of the glass, or"|FALSE
15707|"porcelain cup, in which our food was given us in our infancy, as is further"|FALSE
15707|"explained in the Section XVI. 10, on Instinct.--This disagreeable sensation"|FALSE
15707|"is afterwards excitable not only by a repetition of the sound, that was"|FALSE
15707|"then produced, but by imagination alone, as I have myself frequently"|FALSE
15707|"experienced; in this case the idea of biting a china cup, when I imagine it"|FALSE
15707|"very distinctly, or when I see another person bite a cup or glass, excites"|FALSE
15707|"an actual pain in the nerves of my teeth. So that this idea and pain seem"|FALSE
15707|"to be nothing more than the reiterated motions of those nerves, that were"|FALSE
15707|"formerly so disagreeably affected."|FALSE
15707|"Other ideas that are excited by imagination or recollection in many"|FALSE
15707|"instances produce similar effects on the constitution, as our perceptions"|FALSE
15707|"had formerly produced, and are therefore undoubtedly a repetition of the"|FALSE
15707|"same motions. A story which the celebrated Baron Van Swieton relates of"|FALSE
15707|"himself is to this purpose. He was present when the putrid carcase of a"|FALSE
15707|"dead dog exploded with prodigious stench; and some years afterwards,"|FALSE
15707|"accidentally riding along the same road, he was thrown into the same"|FALSE
15707|"sickness and vomiting by the idea of the stench, as he had before"|FALSE
15707|"experienced from the perception of it."|FALSE
15707|"4. Where the organ of sense is totally destroyed, the ideas which were"|FALSE
15707|"received by that organ seem to perish along with it, as well as the power"|FALSE
15707|"of perception. Of this a satisfactory instance has fallen under my"|FALSE
15707|"observation. A gentleman about sixty years of age had been totally deaf for"|FALSE
15707|"near thirty years: he appeared to be a man of good understanding, and"|FALSE
15707|"amused himself with reading, and by conversing either by the use of the"|FALSE
15707|"pen, or by signs made with his fingers, to represent letters. I observed"|FALSE
15707|"that he had so far forgot the pronunciation of the language, that when he"|FALSE
15707|"attempted to speak, none of his words had distinct articulation, though his"|FALSE
15707|"relations could sometimes understand his meaning. But, which is much to the"|FALSE
15707|"point, he assured me, that in his dreams he always imagined that people"|FALSE
15707|"conversed with him by signs or writing, and never that he heard any one"|FALSE
15707|"speak to him. From hence it appears, that with the perceptions of sounds he"|FALSE
15707|"has also lost the ideas of them; though the organs of speech still retain"|FALSE
15707|"somewhat of their usual habits of articulation."|FALSE
15707|"This observation may throw some light on the medical treatment of deaf"|FALSE
15707|"people; as it may be learnt from their dreams whether the auditory nerve be"|FALSE
15707|"paralytic, or their deafness be owing to some defect of the external organ."|FALSE
15707|"It rarely happens that the immediate organ of vision is perfectly"|FALSE
15707|"destroyed. The most frequent causes of blindness are occasioned by defects"|FALSE
15707|"of the external organ, as in cataracts and obfuscations of the cornea. But"|FALSE
15707|"I have had the opportunity of conversing with two men, who had been some"|FALSE
15707|"years blind; one of them had a complete gutta serena, and the other had"|FALSE
15707|"lost the whole substance of his eyes. They both told me that they did not"|FALSE
15707|"remember to have ever dreamt of visible objects, since the total loss of"|FALSE
15707|"their sight."|FALSE
15707|"V. Another method of discovering that our ideas are animal motions of the"|FALSE
15707|"organs of sense, is from considering the great analogy they bear to the"|FALSE
15707|"motions of the larger muscles of the body. In the following articles it"|FALSE
15707|"will appear that they are originally excited into action by the irritation"|FALSE
15707|"of external objects like our muscles; are associated together like our"|FALSE
15707|"muscular motions; act in similar time with them; are fatigued by continued"|FALSE
15707|"exertion like them; and that the organs of sense are subject to"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation, numbness, palsy, convulsion, and the defects of old age, in"|FALSE
15707|"the same manner as the muscular fibres."|FALSE
15707|"1. All our perceptions or ideas of external objects are universally allowed"|FALSE
15707|"to have been originally excited by the stimulus of those external objects;"|FALSE
15707|"and it will be shewn in a succeeding section, that it is probable that all"|FALSE
15707|"our muscular motions, as well those that are become voluntary as those of"|FALSE
15707|"the heart and glandular system, were originally in like manner excited by"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus of something external to the organ of motion."|FALSE
15707|"2. Our ideas are also associated together after their production precisely"|FALSE
15707|"in the same manner as our muscular motions; which will likewise be fully"|FALSE
15707|"explained in the succeeding section."|FALSE
15707|"3. The time taken up in performing an idea is likewise much the same as"|FALSE
15707|"that taken up in performing a muscular motion. A musician can press the"|FALSE
15707|"keys of an harpsichord with his fingers in the order of a tune he has been"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed to play, in as little time as he can run over those notes in his"|FALSE
15707|"mind. So we many times in an hour cover our eye-balls with our eye-lids"|FALSE
15707|"without perceiving that we are in the dark; hence the perception or idea of"|FALSE
15707|"light is not changed for that of darkness in so small a time as the"|FALSE
15707|"twinkling of an eye; so that in this case the muscular motion of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye-lid is performed quicker than the perception of light can be changed"|FALSE
15707|"for that of darkness.--So if a fire-stick be whirled round in the dark, a"|FALSE
15707|"luminous circle appears to the observer; if it be whirled somewhat slower,"|FALSE
15707|"this circle becomes interrupted in one part; and then the time taken up in"|FALSE
15707|"such a revolution of the stick is the same that the observer uses in"|FALSE
15707|"changing his ideas: thus the [Greek: dolikoskoton enkos] of Homer, the long"|FALSE
15707|"shadow of the flying javelin, is elegantly designed to give us an idea of"|FALSE
15707|"its velocity, and not of its length."|FALSE
15707|"4. The fatigue that follows a continued attention of the mind to one object"|FALSE
15707|"is relieved by changing the subject of our thoughts; as the continued"|FALSE
15707|"movement of one limb is relieved by moving another in its stead. Whereas a"|FALSE
15707|"due exercise of the faculties of the mind strengthens and improves those"|FALSE
15707|"faculties, whether of imagination or recollection; as the exercise of our"|FALSE
15707|"limbs in dancing or fencing increases the strength and agility of the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles thus employed."|FALSE
15707|"5. If the muscles of any limb are inflamed, they do not move without pain;"|FALSE
15707|"so when the retina is inflamed, its motions also are painful. Hence light"|FALSE
15707|"is as intolerable in this kind of ophthalmia, as pressure is to the finger"|FALSE
15707|"in the paronychia. In this disease the patients frequently dream of having"|FALSE
15707|"their eyes painfully dazzled; hence the idea of strong light is painful as"|FALSE
15707|"well as the reality. The first of these facts evinces that our perceptions"|FALSE
15707|"are motions of the organs of sense; and the latter, that our imaginations"|FALSE
15707|"are also motions of the same organs."|FALSE
15707|"6. The organs of sense, like the moving muscles, are liable to become"|FALSE
15707|"benumbed, or less sensible, from compression. Thus, if any person on a"|FALSE
15707|"light day looks on a white wall, he may perceive the ramifications of the"|FALSE
15707|"optic artery, at every pulsation of it, represented by darker branches on"|FALSE
15707|"the white wall; which is evidently owing to its compressing the retina"|FALSE
15707|"during the diastole of the artery. Savage Nosolog."|FALSE
15707|"7. The organs of sense and the moving muscles are alike liable to be"|FALSE
15707|"affected with palsy, as in the gutta serena, and in some cases of deafness;"|FALSE
15707|"and one side of the face has sometimes lost its power of sensation, but"|FALSE
15707|"retained its power of motion; other parts of the body have lost their"|FALSE
15707|"motions but retained their sensation, as in the common hemiplagia; and in"|FALSE
15707|"other instances both these powers have perished together."|FALSE
15707|"8. In some convulsive diseases a delirium or insanity supervenes, and the"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions cease; and conversely the convulsions shall supervene, and the"|FALSE
15707|"delirium cease. Of this I have been a witness many times in a day in the"|FALSE
15707|"paroxysms of violent epilepsies; which evinces that one kind of delirium is"|FALSE
15707|"a convulsion of the organs of sense, and that our ideas are the motions of"|FALSE
15707|"these organs: the subsequent cases will illustrate this observation."|FALSE
15707|"Miss G----, a fair young lady, with light eyes and hair, was seized with"|FALSE
15707|"most violent convulsions of her limbs, with outrageous hiccough, and most"|FALSE
15707|"vehement efforts to vomit: after near an hour was elapsed this tragedy"|FALSE
15707|"ceased, and a calm talkative delirium supervened for about another hour;"|FALSE
15707|"and these relieved each other at intervals during the greatest part of"|FALSE
15707|"three or four days. After having carefully considered this disease, I"|FALSE
15707|"thought the convulsions of her ideas less dangerous than those of her"|FALSE
15707|"muscles; and having in vain attempted to make any opiate continue in her"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, an ounce of laudanum was rubbed along the spine of her back, and a"|FALSE
15707|"dram of it was used as an enema; by this medicine a kind of drunken"|FALSE
15707|"delirium was continued many hours; and when it ceased the convulsions did"|FALSE
15707|"not return; and the lady continued well many years, except some lighter"|FALSE
15707|"relapses, which were relieved in the same manner."|FALSE
15707|"Miss H----, an accomplished young lady, with light eyes and hair, was"|FALSE
15707|"seized with convulsions of her limbs, with hiccough, and efforts to vomit,"|FALSE
15707|"more violent than words can express; these continued near an hour, and were"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded with a cataleptic spasm of one arm, with the hand applied to her"|FALSE
15707|"head; and after about twenty minutes these spasms ceased, and a talkative"|FALSE
15707|"reverie supervened for near an other hour, from which no violence, which it"|FALSE
15707|"was proper to use, could awaken her. These periods of convulsions, first of"|FALSE
15707|"the muscles, and then of the ideas, returned twice a day for several weeks;"|FALSE
15707|"and were at length removed by great doses of opium, after a great variety"|FALSE
15707|"of other medicines and applications had been in vain experienced. This lady"|FALSE
15707|"was subject to frequent relapses, once or twice a year for many years, and"|FALSE
15707|"was as frequently relieved by the same method."|FALSE
15707|"Miss W----, an elegant young lady, with black eyes and hair, had sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"a violent pain of her side, at other times a most painful strangury, which"|FALSE
15707|"were every day succeeded by delirium; which gave a temporary relief to the"|FALSE
15707|"painful spasms. After the vain exhibition of variety of medicines and"|FALSE
15707|"applications by different physicians, for more than a twelvemonth, she was"|FALSE
15707|"directed to take some doses of opium, which were gradually increased, by"|FALSE
15707|"which a drunken delirium was kept up for a day or two, and the pains"|FALSE
15707|"prevented from returning. A flesh diet, with a little wine or beer, instead"|FALSE
15707|"of the low regimen she had previously used, in a few weeks completely"|FALSE
15707|"established her health; which, except a few relapses, has continued for"|FALSE
15707|"many years."|FALSE
15707|"9. Lastly, as we advance in life all the parts of the body become more"|FALSE
15707|"rigid, and are rendered less susceptible of new habits of motion, though"|FALSE
15707|"they retain those that were before established. This is sensibly observed"|FALSE
15707|"by those who apply themselves late in life to music, fencing, or any of the"|FALSE
15707|"mechanic arts. In the same manner many elderly people retain the ideas they"|FALSE
15707|"had learned early in life, but find great difficulty in acquiring new"|FALSE
15707|"trains of memory; insomuch that in extreme old age we frequently see a"|FALSE
15707|"forgetfulness of the business of yesterday, and at the same time a"|FALSE
15707|"circumstantial remembrance of the amusements of their youth; till at length"|FALSE
15707|"the ideas of recollection and activity of the body gradually cease"|FALSE
15707|"together,--such is the condition of humanity!--and nothing remains but the"|FALSE
15707|"vital motions and sensations."|FALSE
15707|"VI. 1. In opposition to this doctrine of the production of our ideas, it"|FALSE
15707|"may be asked, if some of our ideas, like other animal motions, are"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary, why can we not invent new ones, that have not been received by"|FALSE
15707|"perception? The answer will be better understood after having perused the"|FALSE
15707|"succeeding section, where it will be explained, that the muscular motions"|FALSE
15707|"likewise are originally excited by the stimulus of bodies external to the"|FALSE
15707|"moving organ; and that the will has only the power of repeating the motions"|FALSE
15707|"thus excited."|FALSE
15707|"2. Another objector may ask, Can the motion of an organ of sense resemble"|FALSE
15707|"an odour or a colour? To which I can only answer, that it has not been"|FALSE
15707|"demonstrated that any of our ideas resemble the objects that excite them;"|FALSE
15707|"it has generally been believed that they do not; but this shall be"|FALSE
15707|"discussed at large in Sect. XIV."|FALSE
15707|"3. There is another objection that at first view would seem less easy to"|FALSE
15707|"surmount. After the amputation, of a foot or a finger, it has frequently"|FALSE
15707|"happened, that an injury being offered to the stump of the amputated limb,"|FALSE
15707|"whether from cold air, too great pressure, or other accidents, the patient"|FALSE
15707|"has complained, of a sensation of pain in the foot or finger, that was cut"|FALSE
15707|"off. Does not this evince that all our ideas are excited in the brain, and"|FALSE
15707|"not in the organs of sense? This objection is answered, by observing that"|FALSE
15707|"our ideas of the shape, place, and solidity of our limbs, are acquired by"|FALSE
15707|"our organs of touch and of sight, which are situated in our fingers and"|FALSE
15707|"eyes, and not by any sensations in the limb itself."|FALSE
15707|"In this case the pain or sensation, which formerly has arisen in the foot"|FALSE
15707|"or toes, and been propagated along the nerves to the central part of the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorium, was at the same time accompanied with a visible idea of the"|FALSE
15707|"shape and place, and with a tangible idea of the solidity of the affected"|FALSE
15707|"limb: now when these nerves are afterwards affected by any injury done to"|FALSE
15707|"the remaining stump with a similar degree or kind of pain, the ideas of the"|FALSE
15707|"shape, place, or solidity of the lost limb, return by association; as these"|FALSE
15707|"ideas belong to the organs of sight and touch, on which they were first"|FALSE
15707|"excited."|FALSE
15707|"4. If you wonder what organs of sense can be excited into motion, when you"|FALSE
15707|"call up the ideas of wisdom or benevolence, which Mr. Locke has termed"|FALSE
15707|"abstracted ideas; I ask you by what organs of sense you first became"|FALSE
15707|"acquainted with these ideas? And the answer will be reciprocal; for it is"|FALSE
15707|"certain that all our ideas were originally acquired by our organs of sense;"|FALSE
15707|"for whatever excites our perception must be external to the organ that"|FALSE
15707|"perceives it, and we have no other inlets to knowledge but by our"|FALSE
15707|"perceptions: as will be further explained in Section XIV. and XV. on the"|FALSE
15707|"Productions and Classes of Ideas."|FALSE
15707|"VII. If our recollection or imagination be not a repetition of animal"|FALSE
15707|"movements, I ask, in my turn, What is it? You tell me it consists of images"|FALSE
15707|"or pictures of things. Where is this extensive canvas hung up? or where are"|FALSE
15707|"the numerous receptacles in which those are deposited? or to what else in"|FALSE
15707|"the animal system have they any similitude?"|FALSE
15707|"That pleasing picture of objects, represented in miniature on the retina of"|FALSE
15707|"the eye, seems to have given rise to this illusive oratory! It was forgot"|FALSE
15707|"that this representation belongs rather to the laws of light, than to those"|FALSE
15707|"of life; and may with equal elegance be seen in the camera obscura as in"|FALSE
15707|"the eye; and that the picture vanishes for ever, when the object is"|FALSE
15707|"withdrawn."|FALSE

15707|"power of CONTRACTION constitute the laws of animal motion, as the"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances attending the exertion of the power of ATTRACTION constitute"|FALSE
15707|"the laws of motion of inanimate matter."|FALSE
15707|"II. The spirit of animation is the immediate cause of the contraction of"|FALSE

15707|"III. The stimulus of bodies external to the moving organ is the remote"|FALSE

15707|"V. A certain quantity of contraction of animal fibres, if it be perceived"|FALSE

15707|"four powers or motions of the sensorium above described, and from which"|FALSE
15707|"they have their causation."|FALSE
15707|"1. These fibrous contractions were originally caused by the irritations"|FALSE
15707|"excited by objects, which are external to the moving organ. As the"|FALSE
15707|"pulsations of the heart are owing to the irritations excited by the"|FALSE

15707|"succeeded by sensation, or it produces fibrous motions; it is termed"|FALSE

15707|"fibres, or of the organs of sense, that are immediately consequent to this"|FALSE
15707|"exertion or change of the sensorium."|FALSE

15707|"organs of sense, that are immediately consequent to this exertion or change"|FALSE

15707|"3. Voluntary motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which"|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. Many of our muscular motions are excited by perpetual irritations, as"|FALSE
15707|"those of the heart and arterial system by the circumfluent blood. Many"|FALSE
15707|"other of them are excited by intermitted irritations, as those of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach and bowels by the aliment we swallow; of the bile-ducts by the"|FALSE
15707|"bile; of the kidneys, pancreas, and many other glands, by the peculiar"|FALSE
15707|"fluids they separate from the blood; and those of the lacteal and other"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent vessels by the chyle, lymph, and moisture of the atmosphere."|FALSE
15707|"These motions are accelerated or retarded, as their correspondent"|FALSE
15707|"irritations are increased or diminished, without our attention or"|FALSE
15707|"consciousness, in the same manner as the various secretions of fruit, gum,"|FALSE
15707|"resin, wax, and, honey, are produced in the vegetable world, and as the"|FALSE
15707|"juices of the earth and the moisture of the atmosphere are absorbed by"|FALSE
15707|"their roots and foliage."|FALSE
15707|"2. Other muscular motions, that are most frequently connected with our"|FALSE
15707|"sensations, as those of the sphincters of the bladder and anus, and the"|FALSE
15707|"musculi erectores penis, were originally excited into motion by irritation,"|FALSE
15707|"for young children make water, and have other evacuations without attention"|FALSE
15707|"to these circumstances; \"et primis etiam ab incunabulis tenduntur sæpius"|FALSE
15707|"puerorum penes, amore nondum expergefacto.\" So the nipples of young women"|FALSE
15707|"are liable to become turgid by irritation, long before they are in a"|FALSE
15707|"situation to be excited by the pleasure of giving milk to the lips of a"|FALSE
15707|"child."|FALSE
15707|"3. The contractions of the larger muscles of our bodies, that are most"|FALSE
15707|"frequently connected with volition, were originally excited into action by"|FALSE
15707|"internal irritations: as appears from the stretching or yawning of all"|FALSE
15707|"animals after long sleep. In the beginning of some fevers this irritation"|FALSE
15707|"of the muscles produces perpetual stretching and yawning; in other periods"|FALSE
15707|"of fever an universal restlessness arises from the same cause, the patient"|FALSE
15707|"changing the attitude of his body every minute. The repeated struggles of"|FALSE
15707|"the foetus in the uterus must be owing to this internal irritation: for the"|FALSE
15707|"foetus can have no other inducement to move its limbs but the tædium or"|FALSE
15707|"irksomeness of a continued posture."|FALSE
15707|"The following case evinces, that the motions of stretching the limbs after"|FALSE
15707|"a continued attitude are not always owing to the power of the will. Mr."|FALSE
15707|"Dean, a mason, of Austry in Leicestershire, had the spine of the third"|FALSE
15707|"vertebra of the back enlarged; in some weeks his lower extremities became"|FALSE
15707|"feeble, and at length quite paralytic: neither the pain of blisters, the"|FALSE
15707|"heat of fomentations, nor the utmost efforts of the will could produce the"|FALSE
15707|"least motion in these limbs; yet twice or thrice a day for many months his"|FALSE
15707|"feet, legs, and thighs, were affected for many minutes with forceable"|FALSE
15707|"stretchings, attended with the sensation of fatigue; and he at length"|FALSE
15707|"recovered the use of his limbs, though the spine continued protuberant. The"|FALSE
15707|"same circumstance is frequently seen in a less degree in the common"|FALSE
15707|"hemiplagia; and when this happens, I have believed repeated and strong"|FALSE
15707|"shocks of electricity to have been of great advantage."|FALSE
15707|"4. In like manner the various organs of sense are originally excited into"|FALSE
15707|"motion by various external stimuli adapted to this purpose, which motions"|FALSE
15707|"are termed perceptions or ideas; and many of these motions during our"|FALSE
15707|"waking hours are excited by perpetual irritation, as those of the organs of"|FALSE
15707|"hearing and of touch. The former by the constant low indistinct noises that"|FALSE
15707|"murmur around us, and the latter by the weight of our bodies on the parts"|FALSE
15707|"which support them; and by the unceasing variations of the heat, moisture,"|FALSE
15707|"and pressure of the atmosphere; and these sensual motions, precisely as the"|FALSE
15707|"muscular ones above mentioned, obey their correspondent irritations without"|FALSE
15707|"our attention or consciousness."|FALSE
15707|"5. Other classes of our ideas are more frequently excited by our sensations"|FALSE
15707|"of pleasure or pain, and others by volition: but that these have all been"|FALSE
15707|"originally excited by stimuli from external objects, and only vary in their"|FALSE
15707|"combinations or reparations, has been fully evinced by Mr. Locke: and are"|FALSE
15707|"by him termed the ideas of perception in contradistinction to those, which"|FALSE
15707|"he calls the ideas of reflection."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. These muscular motions, that are excited by perpetual irritation,"|FALSE
15707|"are nevertheless occasionally excitable by the sensations of pleasure or"|FALSE
15707|"pain, or by volition; as appears by the palpitation of the heart from fear,"|FALSE
15707|"the increased secretion of saliva at the sight of agreeable food, and the"|FALSE
15707|"glow on the skin of those who are ashamed. There is an instance told in the"|FALSE
15707|"Philosophical Transactions of a man, who could for a time stop the motion"|FALSE
15707|"of his heart when he pleased; and Mr. D. has often told me, be could so far"|FALSE
15707|"increase the peristaltic motion of his bowels by voluntary efforts, as to"|FALSE
15707|"produce an evacuation by stool at any time in half an hour."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are excited by"|FALSE
15707|"perpetual irritation, are nevertheless occasionally excited by sensation or"|FALSE
15707|"volition; as in the night, when we listen under the influence of fear, or"|FALSE
15707|"from voluntary attention, the motions excited in the organ of hearing by"|FALSE
15707|"the whispering of the air in our room, the pulsation of our own arteries,"|FALSE
15707|"or the faint beating of a distant watch, become objects of perception."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of other motions are associated with"|FALSE
15707|"these muscular motions which are excited by irritation; as by the stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"of the blood in the right chamber of the heart, the lungs are induced to"|FALSE
15707|"expand themselves; and the pectoral and intercostal muscles, and the"|FALSE
15707|"diaphragm, act at the same time by their associations with them. And when"|FALSE
15707|"the pharinx is irritated by agreeable food, the muscles of deglutition are"|FALSE
15707|"brought into action by association. Thus when a greater light falls on the"|FALSE
15707|"eye, the iris is brought into action without our attention; and the ciliary"|FALSE
15707|"process, when the focus is formed before or behind the retina, by their"|FALSE
15707|"associations with the increased irritative motions of the organ of vision."|FALSE
15707|"Many common actions of life are produced in a similar manner. If a fly"|FALSE
15707|"settle on my forehead, whilst I am intent on my present occupation, I"|FALSE
15707|"dislodge it with my finger, without exciting my attention or breaking the"|FALSE
15707|"train of my ideas."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner the irritative ideas suggest to us many other trains or"|FALSE
15707|"tribes of ideas that are associated with them. On this kind of connection,"|FALSE
15707|"language, letters, hieroglyphics, and every kind of symbol, depend. The"|FALSE
15707|"symbols themselves produce irritative ideas, or sensual motions, which we"|FALSE
15707|"do not attend to; and other ideas, that are succeeded by sensation, are"|FALSE
15707|"excited by their association with them. And as these irritative ideas make"|FALSE
15707|"up a part of the chain of our waking thoughts, introducing other ideas that"|FALSE
15707|"engage our attention, though themselves are unattended to, we find it very"|FALSE
15707|"difficult to investigate by what steps many of our hourly trains of ideas"|FALSE
15707|"gain their admittance."|FALSE
15707|"It may appear paradoxical, that ideas can exist, and not be attended to;"|FALSE
15707|"but all our perceptions are ideas excited by irritation, and succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation. Now when these ideas excited by irritation give us neither"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure nor pain, we cease to attend to them. Thus whilst I am walking"|FALSE
15707|"through that grove before my window, I do not run against the trees or the"|FALSE
15707|"benches, though my thoughts are strenuously exerted on some other object."|FALSE
15707|"This leads us to a distinct knowledge of irritative ideas, for the idea of"|FALSE
15707|"the tree or bench, which I avoid, exists on my retina, and induces by"|FALSE
15707|"association the action of certain locomotive muscles; though neither itself"|FALSE
15707|"nor the actions of those muscles engage my attention."|FALSE
15707|"Thus whilst we are conversing on this subject, the tone, note, and"|FALSE
15707|"articulation of every individual word forms its correspondent irritative"|FALSE
15707|"idea on the organ of hearing; but we only attend to the associated ideas,"|FALSE
15707|"that are attached by habit to these irritative ones, and are succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; thus when we read the words \"PRINTING-PRESS\" we do not attend to"|FALSE
15707|"the shape, size, or existence of the letters which compose these words,"|FALSE
15707|"though each of them excites a correspondent irritative motion of our organ"|FALSE
15707|"of vision, but they introduce by association our idea of the most useful of"|FALSE
15707|"modern inventions; the capacious reservoir of human knowledge, whose"|FALSE
15707|"branching streams diffuse sciences, arts, and morality, through all nations"|FALSE
15707|"and all ages."|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. Many of the motions of our muscles, that are excited into action by"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, are at the same time accompanied with painful or pleasurable"|FALSE
15707|"sensations; and at length become by habit causable by the sensations. Thus"|FALSE
15707|"the motions of the sphincters of the bladder and anus were originally"|FALSE
15707|"excited into action by irritation; for young children give no attention to"|FALSE
15707|"these evacuations; but as soon as they become sensible of the inconvenience"|FALSE
15707|"of obeying these irritations, they suffer the water or excrement to"|FALSE
15707|"accumulate, till it disagreeably affects them; and the action of those"|FALSE
15707|"sphincters is then in consequence of this disagreeable sensation. So the"|FALSE
15707|"secretion of saliva, which in young children is copiously produced by"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, and drops from their mouths, is frequently attended with the"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable sensation produced by the mastication of tasteful food;, till at"|FALSE
15707|"length the sight of such food to a hungry person excites into action these"|FALSE
15707|"salival glands; as is seen in the slavering of hungry dogs."|FALSE
15707|"The motions of those muscles, which are affected by lascivious ideas, and"|FALSE
15707|"those which are exerted in smiling, weeping, starting from fear, and"|FALSE
15707|"winking at the approach of danger to the eye, and at times the actions of"|FALSE
15707|"every large muscle of the body become causable by our sensations. And all"|FALSE
15707|"these motions are performed with strength and velocity in proportion to the"|FALSE
15707|"energy of the sensation that excites them, and the quantity of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power."|FALSE
15707|"2. Many of the motions of our organs of sense, or ideas, that were"|FALSE
15707|"originally excited into action by irritation, become in like manner more"|FALSE
15707|"frequently causable by our sensations of pleasure or pain. These motions"|FALSE
15707|"are then termed the ideas of imagination, and make up all the scenery and"|FALSE
15707|"transactions of our dreams. Thus when any painful or pleasurable sensations"|FALSE
15707|"possess us, as of love, anger, fear; whether in our sleep or waking hours,"|FALSE
15707|"the ideas, that have been formerly excited by the objects of these"|FALSE
15707|"sensations, now vividly recur before us by their connection with these"|FALSE
15707|"sensations themselves. So the fair smiling virgin, that excited your love"|FALSE
15707|"by her presence, whenever that sensation recurs, rises before you in"|FALSE
15707|"imagination; and that with all the pleasing circumstances, that had before"|FALSE
15707|"engaged your attention. And in sleep, when you dream under the influence of"|FALSE
15707|"fear, all the robbers, fires, and precipices, that you formerly have seen"|FALSE
15707|"or heard of, arise before you with terrible vivacity. All these sensual"|FALSE
15707|"motions, like the muscular ones above mentioned, are performed with"|FALSE
15707|"strength and velocity in proportion to the energy of the sensation of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure or pain, which excites them, and the quantity of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. Many of these muscular motions above described, that are most"|FALSE
15707|"frequently excited by our sensations, are nevertheless occasionally"|FALSE
15707|"causable by volition; for we can smile or frown spontaneously, can make"|FALSE
15707|"water before the quantity or acrimony of the urine produces a disagreeable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, and can voluntarily masticate a nauseous drug, or swallow a"|FALSE
15707|"bitter draught, though our sensation would strongly dissuade us."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are most frequently"|FALSE
15707|"excited by our sensations, are nevertheless occasionally causeable by"|FALSE
15707|"volition, as we can spontaneously call up our last night's dream before us,"|FALSE
15707|"tracing it industriously step by step through all its variety of scenery"|FALSE
15707|"and transaction; or can voluntarily examine or repeat the ideas, that have"|FALSE
15707|"been excited by out disgust or admiration."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of motions are associated with these"|FALSE

15707|"diaphragm; till by their united and repeated succussions the drop is"|FALSE
15707|"returned through the larinx. The same occurs when any thing disagreeably"|FALSE
15707|"affects the nostrils, or the stomach, or the uterus; variety of muscles are"|FALSE
15707|"excited by association into forcible action, not to be suppressed by the"|FALSE
15707|"utmost efforts of the will; as in sneezing, vomiting, and parturition."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner with these sensitive sensual motions, or ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination, are associated many other trains or tribes of ideas, which by"|FALSE
15707|"some writers of metaphysics have been classed under the terms of"|FALSE

15707|"section, and were called sensitive motions. The general tendency of these"|FALSE
15707|"motions is to arrest and to possess the pleasure, or to dislodge or avoid"|FALSE
15707|"the pain: but if this cannot immediately be accomplished, desire or"|FALSE
15707|"aversion are produced, and the motions in consequence of this new faculty"|FALSE
15707|"of the sensorium are called voluntary."|FALSE
15707|"I. 1. Those muscles of the body that are attached to bones, have in general"|FALSE
15707|"their principal connections with volition, as I move my pen or raise my"|FALSE
15707|"body. These motions were originally excited by irritation, as was explained"|FALSE
15707|"in the section on that subject, afterwards the sensations of pleasure or"|FALSE
15707|"pain, that accompanied the motions thus excited, induced a repetition of"|FALSE
15707|"them; and at length many of them were voluntarily practised in succession"|FALSE
15707|"or in combination for the common purposes of life, as in learning to walk,"|FALSE
15707|"or to speak; and are performed with strength and velocity in proportion to"|FALSE
15707|"the energy of the volition, that excites them, and the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"2. Another great class of voluntary motions consists of the ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"recollection. We will to repeat a certain train of ideas, as of the"|FALSE
15707|"alphabet backwards; and if any ideas, that do not belong to this intended"|FALSE
15707|"train, intrude themselves by other connections, we will to reject them, and"|FALSE
15707|"voluntarily persist in the determined train. So at my approach to a house"|FALSE

15707|"will to recollect the names of the numerous family I expect to see there,"|FALSE
15707|"and I do recollect them."|FALSE
15707|"On this voluntary recollection of ideas our faculty of reason depends, as"|FALSE
15707|"it enables us to acquire an idea of the dissimilitude of any two ideas."|FALSE

15707|"triangle inverted over the former; you are said to reason upon this"|FALSE
15707|"subject, or to compare your ideas."|FALSE
15707|"These ideas of recollection, like the muscular motions above mentioned,"|FALSE
15707|"were originally excited by the irritation of external bodies, and were"|FALSE
15707|"termed ideas of perception: afterwards the pleasure or pain, that"|FALSE
15707|"accompanied these motions, induced a repetition of them in the absence of"|FALSE
15707|"the external body, by which they were first excited; and then they were"|FALSE
15707|"termed ideas of imagination. At length they become voluntarily practised in"|FALSE
15707|"succession or in combination for the common purposes of life; as when we"|FALSE
15707|"make ourselves masters of the history of mankind, or of the sciences they"|FALSE
15707|"have investigated; and are then called ideas of recollection; and are"|FALSE
15707|"performed with strength and velocity in proportion to the energy of the"|FALSE
15707|"volition that excites them, and the quantity of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The muscular motions above described, that are most frequently"|FALSE
15707|"obedient to the will are nevertheless occasionally causable by painful or"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable sensation, as in the starting from fear, and the contraction of"|FALSE
15707|"the calf of the leg in the cramp."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are most frequently"|FALSE

15707|"to us in our dreams."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. The muscular motions that are generally subservient to volition,"|FALSE
15707|"are also occasionally causable by irritation, as in stretching the limbs"|FALSE
15707|"after sleep, and yawning. In this manner a contraction of the arm is"|FALSE
15707|"produced by passing the electric fluid from the Leyden phial along its"|FALSE
15707|"muscles; and that even though the limb is paralytic. The sudden motion of"|FALSE
15707|"the arm produces a disagreeable sensation in the joint, but the muscles"|FALSE
15707|"seem to be brought into action simply by irritation."|FALSE
15707|"2. The ideas, that are generally subservient to the will, are in like"|FALSE

15707|"we have before well studied, and often recollected."|FALSE
15707|"IV. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of motions are associated with these"|FALSE

15707|"All the fibrous motions, whether muscular or sensual, which are frequently"|FALSE
15707|"brought into action together, either in combined tribes, or in successive"|FALSE
15707|"trains, become so connected by habit, that when one of them is reproduced"|FALSE
15707|"the others have a tendency to succeed or accompany it."|FALSE
15707|"I. 1. Many of our muscular motions were originally excited in successive"|FALSE
15707|"trains, as the contractions of the auricles and of the ventricles of the"|FALSE
15707|"heart; and others in combined tribes, as the various divisions of the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles which compose the calf of the leg, which were originally irritated"|FALSE
15707|"into synchronous action by the tædium or irksomeness of a continued"|FALSE
15707|"posture. By frequent repetitions these motions acquire associations, which"|FALSE
15707|"continue during our lives, and even after the destruction of the greatest"|FALSE
15707|"part of the sensorium; for the heart of a viper or frog will continue to"|FALSE
15707|"pulsate long after it is taken from the body; and when it has entirely"|FALSE
15707|"ceased to move, if any part of it is goaded with a pin, the whole heart"|FALSE
15707|"will again renew its pulsations. This kind of connection we shall term"|FALSE
15707|"irritative association, to distinguish it from sensitive and voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"associations."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner many of our ideas are originally excited in tribes; as"|FALSE
15707|"all the objects of sight, after we become so well acquainted with the laws"|FALSE
15707|"of vision, as to distinguish figure and distance as well as colour; or in"|FALSE
15707|"trains, as while we pass along the objects that surround us. The tribes"|FALSE
15707|"thus received by irritation become associated by habit, and have been"|FALSE
15707|"termed complex ideas by the writers of metaphysics, as this book, or that"|FALSE
15707|"orange. The trains have received no particular name, but these are alike"|FALSE
15707|"associations of ideas, and frequently continue during our lives. So the"|FALSE
15707|"taste of a pine-apple, though we eat it blindfold, recalls the colour and"|FALSE
15707|"shape of it; and we can scarcely think on solidity without figure."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. By the various efforts of our sensations to acquire or avoid their"|FALSE
15707|"objects, many muscles are daily brought into successive or synchronous"|FALSE
15707|"actions; these become associated by habit, and are then excited together"|FALSE
15707|"with great facility, and in many instances gain indissoluble connections."|FALSE
15707|"So the play of puppies and kittens is a representation of their mode of"|FALSE
15707|"fighting or of taking their prey; and the motions of the muscles necessary"|FALSE
15707|"for those purposes become associated by habit, and gain a great adroitness"|FALSE
15707|"of action by these early repetitions: so the motions of the abdominal"|FALSE
15707|"muscles, which were originally brought into concurrent action, with the"|FALSE
15707|"protrusive motion of the rectum or bladder by sensation, become so"|FALSE
15707|"conjoined with them by habit, that they not only easily obey these"|FALSE
15707|"sensations occasioned by the stimulus of the excrement and urine, but are"|FALSE
15707|"brought into violent and unrestrainable action in the strangury and"|FALSE
15707|"tenesmus. This kind of connection we shall term sensitive association."|FALSE
15707|"2. So many of our ideas, that have been excited together or in succession"|FALSE
15707|"by our sensations, gain synchronous or successive associations, that are"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes indissoluble but with life. Hence the idea of an inhuman or"|FALSE
15707|"dishonourable action perpetually calls up before us the idea of the wretch"|FALSE
15707|"that was guilty of it. And hence those unconquerable antipathies are"|FALSE
15707|"formed, which some people have to the sight of peculiar kinds of food, of"|FALSE
15707|"which in their infancy they have eaten to excess or by constraint."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. In learning any mechanic art, as music, dancing, or the use of the"|FALSE
15707|"sword, we teach many of our muscles to act together or in succession by"|FALSE
15707|"repeated voluntary efforts; which by habit become formed into tribes or"|FALSE
15707|"trains of association, and serve all our purposes with great facility, and"|FALSE
15707|"in some instances acquire an indissoluble union. These motions are"|FALSE
15707|"gradually formed into a habit of acting together by a multitude of"|FALSE
15707|"repetitions, whilst they are yet separately causable by the will, as is"|FALSE
15707|"evident from the long time that is taken up by children in learning to walk"|FALSE
15707|"and to speak; and is experienced by every one, when he first attempts to"|FALSE
15707|"skate upon the ice or to swim: these we shall term voluntary associations."|FALSE
15707|"2. All these muscular movements, when they are thus associated into tribes"|FALSE
15707|"or trains, become afterwards not only obedient to volition, but to the"|FALSE
15707|"sensations and irritations; and the same movement composes a part of many"|FALSE
15707|"different tribes or trains of motion. Thus a single muscle, when it acts in"|FALSE
15707|"consort with its neighbours on one side, assists to move the limb in one"|FALSE
15707|"direction; and in another, when, it acts with those in its neighbourhood on"|FALSE
15707|"the other side; and in other directions, when it acts separately or jointly"|FALSE
15707|"with those that lie immediately under or above it; and all these with equal"|FALSE
15707|"facility after their associations have been well established."|FALSE
15707|"The facility, with which each muscle changes from one associated tribe to"|FALSE
15707|"another, and that either backwards or forwards, is well observable in the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles of the arm in moving the windlass of an air-pump; and the slowness"|FALSE
15707|"of those muscular movements, that have not been associated by habit, may be"|FALSE
15707|"experienced by any one, who shall attempt to saw the air quick"|FALSE
15707|"perpendicularly with one hand, and horizontally with the other at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time."|FALSE
15707|"3. In learning every kind of science we voluntarily associate many tribes"|FALSE
15707|"and trains of ideas, which afterwards are ready for all the purposes either"|FALSE
15707|"of volition, sensation, or irritation; and in some instances acquire"|FALSE
15707|"indissoluble habits of acting together, so as to affect our reasoning, and"|FALSE
15707|"influence our actions. Hence the necessity of a good education."|FALSE
15707|"These associate ideas are gradually formed into habits of acting together"|FALSE
15707|"by frequent repetition, while they are yet separately obedient to the will;"|FALSE
15707|"as is evident from the difficulty we experience in gaining so exact an idea"|FALSE
15707|"of the front of St. Paul's church, as to be able to delineate it with"|FALSE
15707|"accuracy, or in recollecting a poem of a few pages."|FALSE
15707|"And these ideas, thus associated into tribes, not only make up the parts of"|FALSE
15707|"the trains of volition, sensation, and irritation; but the same idea"|FALSE
15707|"composes a part of many different tribes and trains of ideas. So the simple"|FALSE
15707|"idea of whiteness composes a part of the complex idea of snow, milk, ivory;"|FALSE
15707|"and the complex idea of the letter A composes a part of the several"|FALSE
15707|"associated trains of ideas that make up the variety of words, in which this"|FALSE
15707|"letter enters."|FALSE
15707|"The numerous trains of these associated ideas are divided by Mr. Hume into"|FALSE
15707|"three classes, which he has termed contiguity, causation, and resemblance."|FALSE
15707|"Nor should we wonder to find them thus connected together, since it is the"|FALSE
15707|"business of our lives to dispose them into those three classes; and we"|FALSE
15707|"become valuable to ourselves and our friends, as we succeed in it. Those"|FALSE
15707|"who have combined an extensive class of ideas by the contiguity of time or"|FALSE

15707|"resemblances, possess the source of the ornaments of poetry and oratory,"|FALSE
15707|"and of all rational analogy. While those who have connected great classes"|FALSE
15707|"of ideas of causation, are furnished with the powers of producing effects."|FALSE
15707|"These are the men of active wisdom, who lead armies to victory, and"|FALSE
15707|"kingdoms to prosperity; or discover and improve the sciences, which"|FALSE

15707|"dissolved or diffused in water or saliva, and odorous ones, mixed or"|FALSE
15707|"combined with the air, irritate the extremities of the nerves of taste and"|FALSE
15707|"smell; which either penetrate, or are expanded on the membranes of the"|FALSE
15707|"tongue and nostrils; the auditory nerves are stimulated by the vibrations"|FALSE
15707|"of the atmosphere communicated by means of the tympanum and of the fluid,"|FALSE
15707|"whether of air or of water, behind it; and the nerves of touch by the"|FALSE
15707|"hardness of surrounding bodies, though the cuticle is interposed between"|FALSE
15707|"these bodies and the medulla of the nerve."|FALSE
15707|"As the nerves of the senses have each their appropriated objects, which"|FALSE
15707|"stimulate them into activity; so the muscular fibres, which are the"|FALSE
15707|"terminations of other sets of nerves, have their peculiar objects, which"|FALSE
15707|"excite them into action; the longitudinal muscles are stimulated into"|FALSE
15707|"contraction by extension, whence the stretching or pandiculation after a"|FALSE
15707|"long continued posture, during which they have been kept in a state of"|FALSE
15707|"extension; and the hollow muscles are excited into action by distention, as"|FALSE
15707|"those of the rectum and bladder are induced to protrude their contents from"|FALSE
15707|"their sense of the distention rather than of the acrimony of those"|FALSE
15707|"contents."|FALSE
15707|"There are other objects adapted to stimulate the nerves, which terminate in"|FALSE
15707|"variety of membranes, and those especially which form the terminations of"|FALSE
15707|"canals; thus the preparations of mercury particularly affect the salivary"|FALSE
15707|"glands, ipecacuanha the stomach, aloe the sphincter of the anus,"|FALSE
15707|"cantharides that of the bladder, and lastly every gland of the body appears"|FALSE
15707|"to be indued with a kind of taste, by which it selects or forms each its"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar fluid from the blood; and by which it is irritated into activity."|FALSE
15707|"Many of these external properties of bodies, which stimulate our organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense, do not seem to effect this by a single impulse, but by repeated"|FALSE
15707|"impulses; as the nerve of the ear is probably not excitable by a single"|FALSE

15707|"time the solidity of bodies is perceived by a single application of a solid"|FALSE
15707|"body to the nerves of touch, and that even through the cuticle; and we are"|FALSE
15707|"probably possessed of a peculiar sense to distinguish the nice degrees of"|FALSE
15707|"heat and cold."|FALSE
15707|"The senses of touch and of hearing acquaint us with the mechanical impact"|FALSE
15707|"and vibration of bodies, those of smell and taste seem to acquaint us with"|FALSE
15707|"some of their chemical properties, while the sense of vision and of heat"|FALSE
15707|"acquaint us with the existence of their peculiar fluids."|FALSE
15707|"_Sensation and Volition._"|FALSE
15707|"II. Many motions are produced by pleasure or pain, and that even in"|FALSE
15707|"contradiction to the power of volition, as in laughing, or in the"|FALSE
15707|"strangury; but as no name has been given to pleasure or pain, at the time"|FALSE
15707|"it is exerted so as to cause fibrous motions, we have used the term"|FALSE
15707|"sensation for this purpose; and mean it to bear the same analogy to"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure and pain, that the word volition does to desire and aversion."|FALSE
15707|"1. It was mentioned in the fifth Section, that, what we have termed"|FALSE
15707|"sensation is a motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium,"|FALSE
15707|"_beginning_ at some of the extremities of it. This appears first, because"|FALSE
15707|"our pains and pleasures are always caused by our ideas or muscular motions,"|FALSE
15707|"which are the motions of the extremities of the sensorium. And, secondly,"|FALSE
15707|"because the sensation of pleasure or pain frequently continues some time"|FALSE
15707|"after the ideas or muscular motions which excited it have ceased: for we"|FALSE
15707|"often feel a glow of pleasure from an agreeable reverie, for many minutes"|FALSE
15707|"after the ideas, that were the subject of it, have escaped our memory; and"|FALSE
15707|"frequently experience a dejection of spirits without being able to assign"|FALSE
15707|"the cause of it but by much recollection."|FALSE
15707|"When the sensorial faculty of desire or aversion is exerted so as to cause"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous motions, it is termed volition; which is said in Sect. V. to be a"|FALSE
15707|"motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, _terminating_ in"|FALSE
15707|"some of the extremities of it. This appears, first, because our desires and"|FALSE
15707|"aversions always terminate in recollecting and comparing our ideas, or in"|FALSE
15707|"exerting our muscles; which are the motions of the extremities of the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorium. And, secondly, because desire or aversion begins, and frequently"|FALSE
15707|"continues for a time in the central parts of the sensorium, before it is"|FALSE
15707|"peculiarly exerted at the extremities of it; for we sometimes feel desire"|FALSE
15707|"or aversion without immediately knowing their objects, and in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"without immediately exerting any of our muscular or sensual motions to"|FALSE
15707|"attain them: as in the beginning of the passion of love, and perhaps of"|FALSE
15707|"hunger, or in the ennui of indolent people."|FALSE
15707|"Though sensation and volition begin or terminate at the extremities or"|FALSE
15707|"central parts of the sensorium, yet the whole of it is frequently"|FALSE
15707|"influenced by the exertion of these faculties, as appears from their"|FALSE
15707|"effects on the external habit: for the whole skin is reddened by shame, and"|FALSE
15707|"an universal trembling is produced by fear: and every muscle of the body is"|FALSE
15707|"agitated in angry people by the desire of revenge."|FALSE
15707|"There is another very curious circumstance, which shews that sensation and"|FALSE
15707|"volition are movements of the sensorium in contrary directions; that is,"|FALSE
15707|"that volition begins at the central parts of it, and proceeds to the"|FALSE
15707|"extremities; and that sensation begins at the extremities, and proceeds to"|FALSE
15707|"the central parts: I mean that these two sensorial faculties cannot be"|FALSE
15707|"strongly exerted at the same time; for when we exert our volition strongly,"|FALSE
15707|"we do not attend to pleasure or pain; and conversely, when we are strongly"|FALSE
15707|"affected with the sensation of pleasure or pain, we use no volition. As"|FALSE
15707|"will be further explained in Section XVIII. on sleep, and Section XXXIV. on"|FALSE
15707|"volition."|FALSE
15707|"2. All our emotions and passions seem to arise out of the exertions of"|FALSE
15707|"these two faculties of the animal sensorium. Pride, hope, joy, are the"|FALSE
15707|"names of particular pleasures: shame, despair, sorrow, are the names of"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar pains: and love, ambition, avarice, of particular desires: hatred,"|FALSE
15707|"disgust, fear, anxiety, of particular aversions. Whilst the passion of"|FALSE
15707|"anger includes the pain from a recent injury, and the aversion to the"|FALSE
15707|"adversary that occasioned it. And compassion is the pain we experience at"|FALSE
15707|"the sight of misery, and the desire of relieving it."|FALSE
15707|"There is another tribe of desires, which are commonly termed appetites, and"|FALSE
15707|"are the immediate consequences of the absence of some irritative motions."|FALSE
15707|"Those, which arise from defect of internal irritations, have proper names"|FALSE
15707|"conferred upon them, as hunger, thirst, lust, and the desire of air, when"|FALSE
15707|"our respiration is impaired by noxious vapours; and of warmth, when we are"|FALSE
15707|"exposed to too great a degree of cold. But those, whose stimuli are"|FALSE
15707|"external to the body, are named from the objects, which are by nature"|FALSE
15707|"constituted to excite them; these desires originate from our past"|FALSE
15707|"experience of the pleasurable sensations they occasion, as the smell of an"|FALSE
15707|"hyacinth, or the taste of a pine-apple."|FALSE
15707|"Whence it appears, that our pleasures and pains are at least as various and"|FALSE
15707|"as numerous as our irritations; and that our desires and aversions must be"|FALSE
15707|"as numerous as our pleasures and pains. And that as sensation is here used"|FALSE
15707|"as a general term for our numerous pleasures and pains, when they produce"|FALSE
15707|"the contractions of our fibres; so volition is the general name for our"|FALSE

15707|"motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, terminates in the"|FALSE

15707|"terminates in the exertion of our ideas, it is termed recollection,"|FALSE
15707|"reasoning, determining."|FALSE
15707|"3. As the sensations of pleasure and pain are originally introduced by the"|FALSE
15707|"irritations of external objects: so our desires and aversions are"|FALSE
15707|"originally introduced by those sensations; for when the objects of our"|FALSE
15707|"pleasures or pains are at a distance, and we cannot instantaneously possess"|FALSE
15707|"the one, or avoid the other, then desire or aversion is produced, and a"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary exertion of our ideas or muscles succeeds."|FALSE
15707|"The pain of hunger excites you to look out for food, the tree, that shades"|FALSE
15707|"you, presents its odoriferous fruit before your eyes, you approach, pluck,"|FALSE
15707|"and eat."|FALSE
15707|"The various movements of walking to the tree, gathering the fruit, and"|FALSE
15707|"masticating it, are associated motions introduced by their connection with"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; but if from the uncommon height of the tree, the fruit be"|FALSE
15707|"inaccessible, and you are prevented from quickly possessing the intended"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure, desire is produced. The consequence of this desire is, first, a"|FALSE
15707|"deliberation about the means to gain the object of pleasure in process of"|FALSE
15707|"time, as it cannot be procured immediately; and, secondly, the muscular"|FALSE
15707|"action necessary for this purpose."|FALSE
15707|"You voluntarily call up all your ideas of causation, that are related to"|FALSE
15707|"the effect you desire, and voluntarily examine and compare them, and at"|FALSE
15707|"length determine whether to ascend the tree, or to gather stones from the"|FALSE
15707|"neighbouring brook, is easier to practise, or more promising of success;"|FALSE
15707|"and, finally, you gather the stones, and repeatedly fling them to dislodge"|FALSE
15707|"the fruit."|FALSE
15707|"Hence then we gain a criterion to distinguish voluntary acts or thoughts"|FALSE
15707|"from those caused by sensation. As the former are always employed about the"|FALSE
15707|"_means_ to acquire pleasurable objects, or the _means_ to avoid painful"|FALSE
15707|"ones; while the latter are employed in the possession of those, which are"|FALSE
15707|"already in our power."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the activity of this power of volition produces the great difference"|FALSE
15707|"between the human and the brute creation. The ideas and the actions of"|FALSE
15707|"brutes are almost perpetually employed about their present pleasures, or"|FALSE
15707|"their present pains; and, except in the few instances which are mentioned"|FALSE
15707|"in Section XVI, on instinct, they seldom busy themselves about the means of"|FALSE
15707|"procuring future bliss, or of avoiding future misery; so that the acquiring"|FALSE
15707|"of languages, the making of tools, and labouring for money, which are all"|FALSE
15707|"only the means to procure pleasures; and the praying to the Deity, as"|FALSE
15707|"another means to procure happiness, are characteristic of human nature."|FALSE
15707|"4. As there are many diseases produced by the quantity of the sensation of"|FALSE
15707|"pain or pleasure being too great or too little; so are there diseases"|FALSE
15707|"produced by the susceptibility of the constitution to motions causable by"|FALSE
15707|"these sensations being too dull or too vivid. This susceptibility of the"|FALSE
15707|"system to sensitive motions is termed sensibility, to distinguish it from"|FALSE

15707|"Other classes of diseases are owing to the excessive promptitude, or"|FALSE

15707|"2. There are many motions of the body, belonging to the irritative class,"|FALSE
15707|"which might by a hasty observer be mistaken for associated ones; as the"|FALSE
15707|"peristaltic motion of the stomach and intestines, and the contractions of"|FALSE

15707|"particles, which compose an animal muscle, do not touch each other in the"|FALSE

15707|"contraction of the muscle, it is reasonable to conclude, that some other"|FALSE
15707|"agent is the cause of this new approximation. For nothing can act, where it"|FALSE
15707|"does not exist; for to act includes to exist; and therefore the particles"|FALSE
15707|"of the muscular fibre (which in its state of relaxation are supposed not to"|FALSE
15707|"touch) cannot affect each other without the influence of some intermediate"|FALSE
15707|"agent; this agent is here termed the spirit of animation, or sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, but may with equal propriety be termed the power, which causes"|FALSE

15707|"choose to affix to it."|FALSE
15707|"The contraction of a muscular fibre may be compared to the following"|FALSE
15707|"electric experiment, which is here mentioned not as a philosophical"|FALSE
15707|"analogy, but as an illustration or simile to facilitate the conception of a"|FALSE
15707|"difficult subject. Let twenty very small Leyden phials properly coated be"|FALSE
15707|"hung in a row by fine silk threads at a small distance from each other; let"|FALSE
15707|"the internal charge of one phial be positive, and of the other negative"|FALSE
15707|"alternately, if a communication be made from the internal surface of the"|FALSE
15707|"first to the external surface of the last in the row, they will all of them"|FALSE
15707|"instantly approach each other, and thus shorten a line that might connect"|FALSE
15707|"them like a muscular fibre. See Botanic Garden, p. 1. Canto I. 1. 202, note"|FALSE
15707|"on Gymnotus."|FALSE
15707|"The attractions of electricity or of magnetism do not apply philosophically"|FALSE
15707|"to the illustration of the contraction of animal fibres, since the force of"|FALSE
15707|"those attractions increases in some proportion inversely as the distance,"|FALSE
15707|"but in muscular motion there appears no difference in velocity or strength"|FALSE
15707|"during the beginning or end of the contraction, but what may be clearly"|FALSE
15707|"ascribed to the varying mechanic advantage in the approximation of one bone"|FALSE
15707|"to another. Nor can muscular motion be assimilated with greater"|FALSE
15707|"plausibility to the attraction of cohesion or elasticity; for in bending a"|FALSE
15707|"steel spring, as a small sword, a less force is required to bend it the"|FALSE
15707|"first inch than the second; and the second than the third; the particles of"|FALSE
15707|"steel on the convex side of the bent spring endeavouring to restore"|FALSE
15707|"themselves more powerfully the further they are drawn from each other. See"|FALSE
15707|"Botanic Garden, P. I. addit. Note XVIII."|FALSE
15707|"I am aware that this may be explained another way, by supposing the"|FALSE
15707|"elasticity of the spring to depend more on the compression of the particles"|FALSE
15707|"on the concave side than on the extension of them on the convex side; and"|FALSE
15707|"by supposing the elasticity of the elastic gum to depend more on the"|FALSE
15707|"resistance to the lateral compression of its particles than to the"|FALSE
15707|"longitudinal extension of them. Nevertheless in muscular contraction, as"|FALSE
15707|"above observed, there appears no difference in the velocity or force of it"|FALSE
15707|"at its commencement or at its termination; from whence we must conclude"|FALSE
15707|"that animal contraction is governed by laws of its own, and not by those of"|FALSE
15707|"mechanics, chemistry, magnetism, or electricity."|FALSE
15707|"On these accounts I do not think the experiments conclusive, which were"|FALSE
15707|"lately published by Galvani, Volta, and others, to shew a similitude"|FALSE
15707|"between the spirit of animation, which contracts the muscular fibres, and"|FALSE
15707|"the electric fluid. Since the electric fluid may act only as a more potent"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus exciting the muscular fibres into action, and not by supplying"|FALSE
15707|"them with a new quantity of the spirit of life. Thus in a recent hemiplegia"|FALSE
15707|"I have frequently observed, when the patient yawned and stretched himself,"|FALSE
15707|"that the paralytic limbs moved also, though they were totally disobedient"|FALSE
15707|"to the will. And when he was electrified by passing shocks from the"|FALSE
15707|"affected hand to the affected foot, a motion of the paralytic limbs was"|FALSE
15707|"also produced. Now as in the act of yawning the muscles of the paralytic"|FALSE
15707|"limbs were excited into action by the stimulus of the irksomeness of a"|FALSE
15707|"continued posture, and not by any additional quantity of the spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"life; so we may conclude, that the passage of the electric fluid, which"|FALSE
15707|"produced a similar effect, acted only as a stimulus, and not by supplying"|FALSE
15707|"any addition of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"If nevertheless this theory should ever become established, a stimulus must"|FALSE
15707|"be called an eductor of vital ether; which stimulus may consist of"|FALSE
15707|"sensation or volition, as in the electric eel, as well as in the appulses"|FALSE
15707|"of external bodies; and by drawing off the charges of vital fluid may"|FALSE
15707|"occasion the contraction or motions of the muscular fibres, and organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense."|FALSE
15707|"2. The immediate effect of the action of the spirit of animation or"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power on the fibrous parts of the body, whether it acts in the"|FALSE
15707|"mode of irritation, sensation, volition, or association, is a contraction"|FALSE
15707|"of the animal fibre, according to the second law of animal causation. Sect."|FALSE
15707|"IV. Thus the stimulus of the blood induces the contraction of the heart;"|FALSE
15707|"the agreeable taste of a strawberry produces the contraction of the muscles"|FALSE
15707|"of deglutition; the effort of the will contracts the muscles, which move"|FALSE
15707|"the limbs in walking; and by association other muscles of the trunk are"|FALSE
15707|"brought into contraction to preserve the balance of the body. The fibrous"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of the organs of sense have been shewn, by the ocular spectra"|FALSE
15707|"in Sect. III. to suffer similar contraction by each of the above modes of"|FALSE
15707|"excitation; and by their configurations to constitute our ideas."|FALSE
15707|"3. After animal fibres have for some time been excited into contraction, a"|FALSE
15707|"relaxation succeeds, even though the exciting cause continues to act. In"|FALSE
15707|"respect to the irritative motions this is exemplified in the peristaltic"|FALSE
15707|"contractions of the bowels; which cease and are renewed alternately, though"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus of the aliment continues to be uniformly applied; in the"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive motions, as in strangury, tenesmus, and parturition, the"|FALSE
15707|"alternate contractions and relaxations of the muscles exist, though the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus is perpetual. In our voluntary exertions it is experienced, as no"|FALSE
15707|"one can hang long by the hands, however vehemently he wills so to do; and"|FALSE
15707|"in the associate motions the constant change of our attitudes evinces the"|FALSE
15707|"necessity of relaxation to those muscles, which have been long in action."|FALSE
15707|"This relaxation of a muscle after its contraction, even though the stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"continues to be applied, appears to arise from the expenditure or"|FALSE
15707|"diminution of the spirit of animation previously resident in the muscle,"|FALSE
15707|"according to the second law of animal causation in Sect. IV. In those"|FALSE
15707|"constitutions, which are termed weak, the spirit of animation becomes"|FALSE
15707|"sooner exhausted, and tremulous motions are produced, as in the hands of"|FALSE
15707|"infirm people, when they lift a cup to their mouths. This quicker"|FALSE
15707|"exhaustion of the spirit of animation is probably owing to a less quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of it residing in the acting fibres, which therefore more frequently"|FALSE
15707|"require a supply from the nerves, which belong to them."|FALSE
15707|"4. If the sensorial power continues to act, whether it acts in the mode of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, sensation, volition, or association, a new contraction of the"|FALSE
15707|"animal fibre succeeds after a certain interval; which interval is of"|FALSE
15707|"shorter continuance in weak people than in strong ones. This is exemplified"|FALSE
15707|"in the shaking of the hands of weak people, when they attempt to write. In"|FALSE
15707|"a manuscript epistle of one of my correspondents, which is written in a"|FALSE
15707|"small hand, I observed from four to six zigzags in the perpendicular stroke"|FALSE
15707|"of every letter, which shews that both the contractions of the fingers, and"|FALSE
15707|"intervals between them, must have been performed in very short periods of"|FALSE
15707|"time."|FALSE
15707|"The times of contraction of the muscles of enfeebled people being less, and"|FALSE
15707|"the intervals between those contractions being less also, accounts for the"|FALSE
15707|"quick pulse in fevers with debility, and in dying animals. The shortness of"|FALSE
15707|"the intervals between one contraction and another in weak constitutions, is"|FALSE
15707|"probably owing to the general deficiency of the quantity of the spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"animation, and that therefore there is a less quantity of it to be received"|FALSE
15707|"at each interval of the activity of the fibres. Hence in repeated motions,"|FALSE
15707|"as of the fingers in performing on the harpsichord, it would at first sight"|FALSE
15707|"appear, that swiftness and strength were incompatible; nevertheless the"|FALSE
15707|"single contraction of a muscle is performed with greater velocity as well"|FALSE
15707|"as with greater force by vigorous constitutions, as in throwing a javelin."|FALSE
15707|"There is however another circumstance, which may often contribute to cause"|FALSE
15707|"the quickness of the pulse in nervous fevers, as in animals bleeding to"|FALSE
15707|"death in the slaughter-house; which is the deficient quantity of blood;"|FALSE
15707|"whence the heart is but half distended, and in consequence sooner"|FALSE
15707|"contracts. See Sect. XXXII. 2. 1."|FALSE
15707|"For we must not confound frequency of repetition with quickness of motion,"|FALSE
15707|"or the number of pulsations with the velocity, with which the fibres, which"|FALSE
15707|"constitute the coats of the arteries, contract themselves. For where the"|FALSE
15707|"frequency of the pulsations is but seventy-five in a minute, as in health;"|FALSE
15707|"the contracting fibres, which constitute the sides of the arteries, may"|FALSE
15707|"move through a greater space in a given time, than where the frequency of"|FALSE
15707|"pulsation is one hundred and fifty in a minute, as in some fevers with"|FALSE
15707|"great debility. For if in those fevers the arteries do not expand"|FALSE
15707|"themselves in their diastole to more than half the usual diameter of their"|FALSE
15707|"diastole in health, the fibres which constitute their coats, will move"|FALSE
15707|"through a less space in a minute than in health, though they make two"|FALSE
15707|"pulsations for one."|FALSE
15707|"Suppose the diameter of the artery during its systole to be one line, and"|FALSE
15707|"that the diameter of the same artery during its diastole is in health is"|FALSE
15707|"four lines, and in a fever with, great debility only two lines. It follows,"|FALSE
15707|"that the arterial fibres contract in health from a circle of twelve lines"|FALSE
15707|"in circumference to a circle of three lines in circumference, that is they"|FALSE
15707|"move through a space of nine lines in length. While the arterial fibres in"|FALSE
15707|"the fever with debility would twice contract from a circle of six lines to"|FALSE
15707|"a circle of three lines; that is while they move through a space equal to"|FALSE
15707|"six lines. Hence though the frequency of pulsation in fever be greater as"|FALSE
15707|"two to one, yet the velocity of contraction in health is greater as nine to"|FALSE
15707|"six, or as three to two."|FALSE
15707|"On the contrary in inflammatory diseases with strength, as in the pleurisy,"|FALSE
15707|"the velocity of the contracting sides of the arteries is much greater than"|FALSE
15707|"in health, for if we suppose the number of pulsations in a pleurisy to be"|FALSE
15707|"half as much more than in health, that is as one hundred and twenty to"|FALSE
15707|"eighty, (which is about what generally happens in inflammatory diseases)"|FALSE
15707|"and if the diameter of the artery in diastole be one third greater than in"|FALSE
15707|"health, which I believe is near the truth, the result will be, that the"|FALSE
15707|"velocity of the contractile sides of the arteries will be in a pleurisy as"|FALSE
15707|"two and a half to one, compared to the velocity of their contraction in a"|FALSE
15707|"state of health, for if the circumference of the systole of the artery be"|FALSE
15707|"three lines, and the diastole in health be twelve lines in circumference,"|FALSE
15707|"and in a pleurisy eighteen lines; and secondly, if the artery pulsates"|FALSE
15707|"thrice in the diseased state for twice in the healthy one, it follows, that"|FALSE
15707|"the velocity of contraction in the diseased state to that in the healthy"|FALSE
15707|"state will be forty-five to eighteen, or as two and a half to one."|FALSE
15707|"From hence it would appear, that if we had a criterion to determine the"|FALSE
15707|"velocity of the arterial contractions, it would at the same time give us"|FALSE
15707|"their strength, and thus be of more service in distinguishing diseases,"|FALSE
15707|"than the knowledge of their frequency. As such a criterion cannot be had,"|FALSE
15707|"the frequency of pulsation, the age of the patient being allowed for, will"|FALSE
15707|"in some measure assist us to distinguish arterial strength from arterial"|FALSE
15707|"debility, since in inflammatory diseases with strength the frequency seldom"|FALSE
15707|"exceeds one hundred and eighteen or one hundred and twenty pulsations in a"|FALSE
15707|"minute; unless under peculiar circumstance, as the great additional stimuli"|FALSE
15707|"of wine or of external heat."|FALSE
15707|"5. After a muscle or organ of sense has been excited into contraction, and"|FALSE
15707|"the sensorial power ceases to act, the last situation or configuration of"|FALSE
15707|"it continues; unless it be disturbed by the action of some antagonist"|FALSE
15707|"fibres, or other extraneous power. Thus in weak or languid people, wherever"|FALSE
15707|"they throw their limbs on their bed or sofa, there they lie, till another"|FALSE
15707|"exertion changes their attitude; hence one kind of ocular spectra seems to"|FALSE
15707|"be produced after looking at bright objects; thus when a fire-stick is"|FALSE
15707|"whirled round in the night, there appears in the eye a complete circle of"|FALSE
15707|"fire; the action or configuration of one part of the retina not ceasing"|FALSE
15707|"before the return of the whirling fire."|FALSE
15707|"Thus if any one looks at the setting sun for a short time, and then covers"|FALSE
15707|"his closed eyes with his hand, he will for many seconds of time perceive"|FALSE
15707|"the image of the sun on his retina. A similar image of all other bodies"|FALSE
15707|"would remain some time in the eye, but is effaced by the eternal change of"|FALSE
15707|"the motions of the extremity of this nerve in our attention to other"|FALSE
15707|"objects. See Sect. XVIII. 5. on Sleep. Hence the dark spots, and other"|FALSE
15707|"ocular spectra, are more frequently attended to, and remain longer in the"|FALSE
15707|"eyes of weak people, as after violent exercise, intoxication, or want of"|FALSE
15707|"sleep."|FALSE
15707|"6. A contraction of the fibres somewhat greater than usual introduces"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable sensation into the system, according to the fourth law of"|FALSE
15707|"animal causation. Hence the pleasure in the beginning of drunkenness is"|FALSE
15707|"owing to the increased action of the system from the stimulus of vinous"|FALSE
15707|"spirit or of opium. If the contractions be still greater in energy or"|FALSE
15707|"duration, painful sensations are introduced, as in consequence of great"|FALSE
15707|"heat, or caustic applications, or fatigue."|FALSE
15707|"If any part of the system, which is used to perpetual activity, as the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, or heart, or the fine vessels of the skin, acts for a time with"|FALSE
15707|"less energy, another kind of painful sensation ensues, which is called"|FALSE
15707|"hunger, or faintness, or cold. This occurs in a less degree in the"|FALSE
15707|"locomotive muscles, and is called wearysomeness. In the two former kinds of"|FALSE
15707|"sensation there is an expenditure of sensorial power, in these latter there"|FALSE
15707|"is an accumulation of it."|FALSE
15707|"7. We have used the words exertion of sensorial power as a general term to"|FALSE
15707|"express either irritation, sensation, volition, or association; that is, to"|FALSE
15707|"express the activity or motion of the spirit of animation, at the time it"|FALSE
15707|"produces the contractions of the fibrous parts of the system. It may be"|FALSE
15707|"supposed that there may exist a greater or less mobility of the fibrous"|FALSE
15707|"parts of our system, or a propensity to be stimulated into contraction by"|FALSE
15707|"the greater or less quantity or energy of the spirit of animation; and that"|FALSE
15707|"hence if the exertion of the sensorial power be in its natural state, and"|FALSE
15707|"the mobility of the fibres be increased, the same quantity of fibrous"|FALSE
15707|"contraction will be caused, as if the mobility of the fibres continues in"|FALSE
15707|"its natural state, and the sensorial exertion be increased."|FALSE
15707|"Thus it may be conceived, that in diseases accompanied with strength, as in"|FALSE
15707|"inflammatory fevers with arterial strength, that the cause of greater"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous contraction, may exist in the increased mobility of the fibres,"|FALSE
15707|"whose contractions are thence both more forceable and more frequent. And"|FALSE
15707|"that in diseases attended with debility, as in nervous fevers, where the"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous contractions are weaker, and more frequent, it may be conceived"|FALSE
15707|"that the cause consists in a decrease of mobility of the fibres; and that"|FALSE
15707|"those weak constitutions, which are attended with cold extremities and"|FALSE
15707|"large pupils of the eyes, may possess less mobility of the contractile"|FALSE
15707|"fibres, as well as less quantity of exertion of the spirit of animation."|FALSE
15707|"In answer to this mode of reasoning it may be sufficient to observe, that"|FALSE
15707|"the contractile fibres consist of inert matter, and when the sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power is withdrawn, as in death, they possess no power of motion at all,"|FALSE
15707|"but remain in their last state, whether of contraction or relaxation, and"|FALSE
15707|"must thence derive the whole of this property from the spirit of animation."|FALSE
15707|"At the same time it is not improbable, that the moving fibres of strong"|FALSE
15707|"people may possess a capability of receiving or containing a greater"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of the spirit of animation than those of weak people."|FALSE
15707|"In every contraction of a fibre there is an expenditure of the sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, or spirit of animation; and where the exertion of this sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power has been for some time increased, and the muscles or organs of sense"|FALSE
15707|"have in consequence acted with greater energy, its propensity to activity"|FALSE
15707|"is proportionally lessened; which is to be ascribed to the exhaustion or"|FALSE
15707|"diminution of its quantity. On the contrary, where there has been less"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous contraction than usual for a certain time, the sensorial power or"|FALSE
15707|"spirit of animation becomes accumulated in the inactive part of the system."|FALSE
15707|"Hence vigour succeeds rest, and hence the propensity to action of all our"|FALSE
15707|"organs of sense and muscles is in a state of perpetual fluctuation. The"|FALSE
15707|"irritability for instance of the retina, that is, its quantity of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, varies every moment according to the brightness or obscurity of the"|FALSE
15707|"object last beheld compared with the present one. The same occurs to our"|FALSE
15707|"sense of heat, and to every part of our system, which is capable of being"|FALSE
15707|"excited into action."|FALSE
15707|"When this variation of the exertion of the sensorial power becomes much and"|FALSE
15707|"permanently above or beneath the natural quantity, it becomes a disease. If"|FALSE
15707|"the irritative motions be too great or too little, it shews that the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of external things affect this sensorial power too violently or"|FALSE
15707|"too inertly. If the sensitive motions be too great or too little, the cause"|FALSE
15707|"arises from the deficient or exuberant quantity of sensation produced in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of the motions of the muscular fibres or organs of sense; if"|FALSE
15707|"the voluntary actions are diseased the cause is to be looked for in the"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of volition produced in consequence of the desire or aversion"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned by the painful or pleasurable sensations above mentioned. And"|FALSE
15707|"the diseases of associations probably depend on the greater or less"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of the other three sensorial powers by which they were formed."|FALSE
15707|"From whence it appears that the propensity to action, whether it be called"|FALSE
15707|"irritability, sensibility, voluntarity, or associability, is only another"|FALSE
15707|"mode of expression for the quantity of sensorial power residing in the"|FALSE
15707|"organ to be excited. And that on the contrary the words inirritability and"|FALSE
15707|"insensibility, together with inaptitude to voluntary and associate motions,"|FALSE
15707|"are synonymous with deficiency of the quantity of sensorial power, or of"|FALSE
15707|"the spirit of animation, residing in the organs to be excited."|FALSE
15707|"II. _Of sensorial Exertion._"|FALSE
15707|"1. There are three circumstances to be attended to in the production of"|FALSE
15707|"animal motions, 1st. The stimulus. 2d. The sensorial power. 3d. The"|FALSE
15707|"contractile fibre. 1st. A stimulus, external to the organ, originally"|FALSE
15707|"induces into action the sensorial faculty termed irritation; this produces"|FALSE
15707|"the contraction of the fibres, which, if it be perceived at all, introduces"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure or pain; which in their active state are termed sensation; which"|FALSE
15707|"is another sensorial faculty, and occasionally produces contraction of the"|FALSE
15707|"fibres; this pleasure or pain is therefore to be considered as another"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, which may either act alone or in conjunction with the former"|FALSE
15707|"faculty of the sensorium termed irritation."|FALSE
15707|"This new stimulus of pleasure or pain either induces into action the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial faculty termed sensation, which then produces the contraction of"|FALSE
15707|"the fibres; or it introduces desire or aversion, which excite into action"|FALSE
15707|"another sensorial faculty, termed volition, and may therefore be considered"|FALSE
15707|"as another stimulus, which either alone or in conjunction with one or both"|FALSE
15707|"of the two former faculties of the sensorium produces the contraction of"|FALSE
15707|"animal fibres. There is another sensorial power, that of association, which"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually, in conjunction with one or more of the above, and frequently"|FALSE
15707|"singly, produces the contraction of animal fibres, and which is itself"|FALSE
15707|"excited into action by the previous motions of contracting fibres."|FALSE
15707|"Now as the sensorial power, termed irritation, residing in any particular"|FALSE
15707|"fibres, is excited into exertion by the stimulus of external bodies acting"|FALSE
15707|"on those fibres; the sensorial power, termed sensation, residing in any"|FALSE
15707|"particular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of pleasure or"|FALSE
15707|"pain acting on those fibres; the sensorial power, termed volition, residing"|FALSE
15707|"in any particular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of desire"|FALSE
15707|"or aversion; and the sensorial power, termed association, residing in any"|FALSE
15707|"particular fibres, is excited into action by the stimulus of other fibrous"|FALSE
15707|"motions, which had frequently preceded them. The word stimulus may"|FALSE
15707|"therefore be used without impropriety of language, for any of these four"|FALSE
15707|"causes, which excite the four sensorial powers into exertion. For though"|FALSE
15707|"the immediate cause of volition has generally been termed _a motive_; and"|FALSE
15707|"that of irritation only has generally obtained the name of _stimulus_; yet"|FALSE
15707|"as the immediate cause, which excites the sensorial powers of sensation, or"|FALSE
15707|"of association into exertion, have obtained no general name, we shall use"|FALSE
15707|"the word stimulus for them all."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the quantity of motion produced in any particular part of the animal"|FALSE
15707|"system will be as the quantity of stimulus and the quantity of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, or spirit of animation, residing in the contracting fibres. Where"|FALSE
15707|"both these quantities are great, _strength_ is produced, when that word is"|FALSE
15707|"applied to the motions of animal bodies. Where either of them is deficient,"|FALSE
15707|"_weakness_ is produced, as applied to the motions of animal bodies."|FALSE
15707|"Now as the sensorial power, or spirit of animation, is perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"exhausted by the expenditure of it in fibrous contractions, and is"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually renewed by the secretion or production of it in the brain and"|FALSE
15707|"spinal marrow, the quantity of animal strength must be in a perpetual state"|FALSE
15707|"of fluctuation on this account; and if to this be added the unceasing"|FALSE
15707|"variation of all the four kinds of stimulus above described, which produce"|FALSE
15707|"the exertions of the sensorial powers, the ceaseless vicissitude of animal"|FALSE
15707|"strength becomes easily comprehended."|FALSE
15707|"If the quantity of sensorial power remains the same, and the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus be lessened, a weakness of the fibrous contractions ensues, which"|FALSE
15707|"may be denominated _debility from defect of stimulus_. If the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus remains the same, and the quantity of sensorial power be lessened,"|FALSE
15707|"another kind of weakness ensues, which may be termed _debility from defect"|FALSE
15707|"of sensorial power_; the former of these is called by Dr. Brown, in his"|FALSE
15707|"Elements of Medicine, direct debility, and the latter indirect debility."|FALSE
15707|"The coincidence of some parts of this work with correspondent deductions in"|FALSE
15707|"the Brunonian Elementa Medicina, a work (with some exceptions) of great"|FALSE
15707|"genius, must be considered as confirmations of the truth of the theory, as"|FALSE
15707|"they were probably arrived at by different trains of reasoning."|FALSE
15707|"Thus in those who have been exposed to cold and hunger there is a"|FALSE
15707|"deficiency of stimulus. While in nervous fever there is a deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power. And in habitual drunkards, in a morning before their usual"|FALSE
15707|"potation, there is a deficiency both of stimulus and of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"While, on the other hand, in the beginning of intoxication there is an"|FALSE
15707|"excess of stimulus; in the hot-ach, after the hands have been immersed in"|FALSE
15707|"snow, there is a redundancy of sensorial power; and in inflammatory"|FALSE
15707|"diseases with arterial strength, there is an excess of both."|FALSE
15707|"Hence if the sensorial power be lessened, while the quantity of stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"remains the same as in nervous fever, the frequency of repetition of the"|FALSE
15707|"arterial contractions may continue, but their force in respect to removing"|FALSE
15707|"obstacles, as in promoting the circulation of the blood, or the velocity of"|FALSE
15707|"each contraction, will be diminished, that is, the animal strength will be"|FALSE
15707|"lessened. And secondly, if the quantity of sensorial power be lessened, and"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus be increased to a certain degree, as in giving opium in"|FALSE
15707|"nervous fevers, the arterial contractions may be performed more frequently"|FALSE
15707|"than natural, yet with less strength."|FALSE
15707|"And thirdly, if the sensorial power continues the same in respect to"|FALSE
15707|"quantity, and the stimulus be somewhat diminished, as in going into a"|FALSE
15707|"darkish room, or into a coldish bath, suppose of about eighty degrees of"|FALSE
15707|"heat, as Buxton-bath, a temporary weakness of the affected fibres is"|FALSE
15707|"induced, till an accumulation of sensorial power gradually succeeds, and"|FALSE
15707|"counterbalances the deficiency of stimulus, and then the bath ceases to"|FALSE
15707|"feel cold, and the room ceases to appear dark; because the fibres of the"|FALSE
15707|"subcutaneous vessels, or of the organs of sense, act with their usual"|FALSE
15707|"energy."|FALSE
15707|"A set of muscular fibres may thus be stimulated into violent exertion, that"|FALSE
15707|"is, they may act frequently, and with their whole sensorial power, but may"|FALSE
15707|"nevertheless not act strongly; because the quantity of their sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power was originally small, or was previously exhausted. Hence a stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"may be great, and the irritation in consequence act with its full force, as"|FALSE
15707|"in the hot paroxysms of nervous fever; but if the sensorial power, termed"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, be small in quantity, the force of the fibrous contractions,"|FALSE
15707|"and the times of their continuance in their contracted state, will be"|FALSE
15707|"proportionally small."|FALSE
15707|"In the same manner in the hot paroxysm of putrid fevers, which are shewn in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XXXIII. to be inflammatory fevers with arterial debility, the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power termed sensation is exerted with great activity, yet the"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous contractions, which produce the circulation of the blood, are"|FALSE
15707|"performed without strength, because the quantity of sensorial power then"|FALSE
15707|"residing in that part of the system is small."|FALSE
15707|"Thus in irritative fever with arterial strength, that is, with excess of"|FALSE
15707|"spirit of animation, the quantity of exertion during the hot part of the"|FALSE
15707|"paroxysm is to be estimated from the quantity of stimulus, and the quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of sensorial power. While in sensitive (or inflammatory) fever with"|FALSE
15707|"arterial strength, that is, with excess of spirit of animation, the violent"|FALSE
15707|"and forcible actions of the vascular system during the hot part of the"|FALSE
15707|"paroxysm are induced by the exertions of two sensorial powers, which are"|FALSE
15707|"excited by two kinds of stimulus. These are the sensorial power of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation excited by the stimulus of bodies external to the moving fibres,"|FALSE
15707|"and the sensorial power of sensation excited by the pain in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"the increased contractions of those moving fibres."|FALSE
15707|"And in insane people in some cases the force of their muscular actions will"|FALSE
15707|"be in proportion to the quantity of sensorial power, which they possess,"|FALSE
15707|"and the quantity of the stimulus of desire or aversion, which excites their"|FALSE
15707|"volition into action. At the same time in other cases the stimulus of pain"|FALSE
15707|"or pleasure, and the stimulus of external bodies, may excite into action"|FALSE
15707|"the sensorial powers of sensation and irritation, and thus add greater"|FALSE
15707|"force to their muscular actions."|FALSE
15707|"2. The application of the stimulus, whether that stimulus be some quality"|FALSE
15707|"of external bodies, or pleasure or pain, or desire or aversion, or a link"|FALSE
15707|"of association, excites the correspondent sensorial power into action, and"|FALSE
15707|"this causes the contraction of the fibre. On the contraction of the fibre a"|FALSE
15707|"part of the spirit of animation becomes expended, and the fibre ceases to"|FALSE
15707|"contract, though the stimulus continues to be applied; till in a certain"|FALSE
15707|"time the fibre having received a supply of sensorial power is ready to"|FALSE
15707|"contract again, if the stimulus continues to be applied. If the stimulus on"|FALSE
15707|"the contrary be withdrawn, the same quantity of quiescent sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"becomes resident in the fibre as before its contraction; as appears from"|FALSE
15707|"the readiness for action of the large locomotive muscles of the body in a"|FALSE
15707|"short time after common exertion."|FALSE
15707|"But in those muscular fibres, which are subject to constant stimulus, as"|FALSE
15707|"the arteries, glands, and capillary vessels, another phenomenon occurs, if"|FALSE
15707|"their accustomed stimulus be withdrawn; which is, that the sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"becomes accumulated in the contractile fibres, owing to the want of its"|FALSE
15707|"being perpetually expended, or carried away, by their usual unremitted"|FALSE
15707|"contractions. And on this account those muscular fibres become afterwards"|FALSE
15707|"excitable into their natural actions by a much weaker stimulus; or into"|FALSE
15707|"unnatural violence of action by their accustomed stimulus, as is seen in"|FALSE
15707|"the hot fits of intermittent fevers, which are in consequence of the"|FALSE
15707|"previous cold ones. Thus the minute vessels of the skin are constantly"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated by the fluid matter of heat; if the quantity of this stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"heat be a while diminished, as in covering the hands with snow, the vessels"|FALSE
15707|"cease to act, as appears from the paleness of the skin; if this cold"|FALSE
15707|"application of snow be continued but a short time, the sensorial power,"|FALSE
15707|"which had habitually been supplied to the fibres, becomes now accumulated"|FALSE
15707|"in them, owing to the want of its being expended by their accustomed"|FALSE
15707|"contractions. And thence a less stimulus of heat will now excite them into"|FALSE
15707|"violent contractions."|FALSE
15707|"If the quiescence of fibres, which had previously been subject to perpetual"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, continues a longer time; or their accustomed stimulus be more"|FALSE
15707|"completely withdrawn; the accumulation of sensorial power becomes still"|FALSE
15707|"greater, as in those exposed to cold and hunger; pain is produced, and the"|FALSE
15707|"organ gradually dies from the chemical changes, which take place in it; or"|FALSE
15707|"it is at a great distance of time restored to action by stimulus applied"|FALSE
15707|"with great caution in small quantity, as happens to some larger animals and"|FALSE
15707|"to many insects, which during the winter months lie benumbed with cold, and"|FALSE
15707|"are said to sleep, and to persons apparently drowned, or apparently frozen"|FALSE
15707|"to death. Snails have been said to revive by throwing them into water after"|FALSE
15707|"having been many years shut up in the cabinets of the curious; and eggs and"|FALSE
15707|"seeds in general are restored to life after many months of torpor by the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of warmth and moisture."|FALSE
15707|"The inflammation of schirrous tumours, which have long existed in a state"|FALSE
15707|"of inaction, is a process of this kind; as well as the sensibility acquired"|FALSE
15707|"by inflamed tendons and bones, which had at their formation a similar"|FALSE
15707|"sensibility, which had so long lain dormant in their uninflamed state."|FALSE
15707|"3. If after long quiescence from defect of stimulus the fibres, which had"|FALSE
15707|"previously been habituated to perpetual stimulus, are again exposed to but"|FALSE
15707|"their usual quantity of it; as in those who have suffered the extremes of"|FALSE
15707|"cold or hunger; a violent exertion of the affected organ commences, owing,"|FALSE
15707|"as above explained, to the great accumulation of sensorial power. This"|FALSE
15707|"violent exertion not only diminishes the accumulated spirit of animation,"|FALSE
15707|"but at the same time induces pleasure or pain into the system, which,"|FALSE
15707|"whether it be succeeded by inflammation or not, becomes an additional"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, and acting along with the former one, produces still greater"|FALSE
15707|"exertions; and thus reduces the sensorial power in the contracting fibres"|FALSE
15707|"beneath its natural quantity."|FALSE
15707|"When the spirit of animation is thus exhausted by useless exertions, the"|FALSE
15707|"organ becomes torpid or unexcitable into action, and a second fit of"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence succeeds that of abundant activity. During this second fit of"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence the sensorial power becomes again accumulated, and another fit"|FALSE
15707|"of exertion follows in train. These vicissitudes of exertion and inertion"|FALSE
15707|"of the arterial system constitute the paroxysms of remittent fevers; or"|FALSE
15707|"intermittent ones, when there is an interval of the natural action of the"|FALSE
15707|"arteries between the exacerbations."|FALSE
15707|"In these paroxysms of fevers, which consist of the libration of the"|FALSE
15707|"arterial system between the extremes of exertion and quiescence, either the"|FALSE
15707|"fits become less and less violent from the contractile fibres becoming"|FALSE
15707|"coming less excitable to the stimulus by habit, that is, by becoming"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed to it, as explained below XII. 3. 1. or the whole sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power becomes exhausted, and the arteries cease to beat, and the patient"|FALSE
15707|"dies in the cold part of the paroxysm. Or secondly, so much pain is"|FALSE
15707|"introduced into the system by the violent contractions of the fibres, that"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation arises, which prevents future cold fits by expending a part of"|FALSE
15707|"the sensorial power in the extension of old vessels or the production of"|FALSE
15707|"new ones; and thus preventing the too great accumulation or exertion of it"|FALSE
15707|"in other parts of the system; or which by the great increase of stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"excites into great action the whole glandular system as well as the"|FALSE
15707|"arterial, and thence a greater quantity of sensorial power is produced in"|FALSE
15707|"the brain, and thus its exhaustion in any peculiar part of the system"|FALSE
15707|"ceases to be affected."|FALSE
15707|"4. Or thirdly, in consequence of the painful or pleasurable sensation above"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned, desire and aversion are introduced, and inordinate volition"|FALSE
15707|"succeeds; which by its own exertions expends so much of the spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"animation, that the two other sensorial faculties, or irritation and"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, act so much more feebly; that the paroxysms of fever, or that"|FALSE
15707|"libration between the extremes of exertion and inactivity of the arterial"|FALSE
15707|"system, gradually subsides. On this account a temporary insanity is a"|FALSE
15707|"favourable sign in fevers, as I have had some opportunities of observing."|FALSE
15707|"III. _Of repeated Stimulus._"|FALSE
15707|"1. When a stimulus is repeated more frequently than the expenditure of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power can be renewed in the acting organ, the effect of the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus becomes gradually diminished. Thus if two grains of opium be"|FALSE
15707|"swallowed by a person unused to so strong a stimulus, all the vascular"|FALSE
15707|"systems in the body act with greater energy, all the secretions and the"|FALSE
15707|"absorption from those secreted fluids are increased in quantity; and"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure or pain are introduced into the system, which adds an additional"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus to that already too great. After some hours the sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"becomes diminished in quantity, expended by the great activity of the"|FALSE
15707|"system; and thence, when the stimulus of the opium is withdrawn, the fibres"|FALSE
15707|"will not obey their usual degree of natural stimulus, and a consequent"|FALSE
15707|"torpor or quiescence succeeds, as is experienced by drunkards, who on the"|FALSE
15707|"day after a great excess of spirituous potation feel indigestion, head-ach,"|FALSE
15707|"and general debility."|FALSE
15707|"In this fit of torpor or quiescence of a part or of the whole of the"|FALSE
15707|"system, an accumulation of the sensorial power in the affected fibres is"|FALSE
15707|"formed, and occasions a second paroxysm of exertion by the application only"|FALSE
15707|"of the natural stimulus, and thus a libration of the sensorial exertion"|FALSE
15707|"between one excess and the other continues for two or three days, where the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus was violent in degree; and for weeks in some fevers, from the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of contagious matter."|FALSE
15707|"But if a second dose of opium be exhibited before the fibres have regained"|FALSE
15707|"their natural quantity of sensorial power, its effect will be much less"|FALSE
15707|"than the former, because the spirit of animation or sensorial power is in"|FALSE
15707|"part exhausted by the previous excess of exertion. Hence all medicines"|FALSE
15707|"repeated too frequently gradually lose their effect, as opium and wine."|FALSE
15707|"Many things of disagreeable taste at first cease to be disagreeable by"|FALSE
15707|"frequent repetition, as tobacco; grief and pain gradually diminish, and at"|FALSE
15707|"length cease altogether, and hence life itself becomes tolerable."|FALSE
15707|"Besides the temporary diminution of the spirit of animation or sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, which is naturally stationary or resident in every living fibre, by"|FALSE
15707|"a single exhibition of a powerful stimulus, the contractile fibres"|FALSE
15707|"themselves, by the perpetual application of a new quantity of stimulus,"|FALSE
15707|"before they have regained their natural quantity of sensorial power, appear"|FALSE
15707|"to suffer in their capability of receiving so much as the natural quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of sensorial power; and hence a permanent deficiency of spirit of animation"|FALSE
15707|"takes place, however long the stimulus may have been withdrawn. On this"|FALSE
15707|"cause depends the permanent debility of those, who have been addicted to"|FALSE
15707|"intoxication, the general weakness of old age, and the natural debility or"|FALSE
15707|"inirritability of those, who have pale skins and large pupils of their"|FALSE
15707|"eyes."|FALSE
15707|"There is a curious phenomenon belongs to this place, which has always"|FALSE
15707|"appeared difficult of solution; and that is, that opium or aloes may be"|FALSE
15707|"exhibited in small doses at first, and gradually increased to very large"|FALSE
15707|"ones without producing stupor or diarrhoea. In this case, though the opium"|FALSE
15707|"and aloes are given in such small doses as not to produce intoxication or"|FALSE
15707|"catharsis, yet they are exhibited in quantities sufficient in some degree"|FALSE
15707|"to exhaust the sensorial power, and hence a stronger and a stronger dose is"|FALSE
15707|"required; otherwise the medicine would soon cease to act at all."|FALSE
15707|"On the contrary, if the opium or aloes be exhibited in a large dose at"|FALSE
15707|"first, so as to produce intoxication or diarrhoea; after a few repetitions"|FALSE
15707|"the quantity of either of them may be diminished, and they will still"|FALSE
15707|"produce this effect. For the more powerful stimulus dissevers the"|FALSE
15707|"progressive catenations of animal motions, described in Sect. XVII. and"|FALSE
15707|"introduces a new link between them; whence every repetition strengthens"|FALSE
15707|"this new association or catenation, and the stimulus may be gradually"|FALSE
15707|"decreased, or be nearly withdrawn, and yet the effect shall continue;"|FALSE
15707|"because the sensorial power of association or catenation being united with"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus, increases in energy with every repetition of the catenated"|FALSE
15707|"circle; and it is by these means that all the irritative associations of"|FALSE
15707|"motions are originally produced."|FALSE
15707|"2. When a stimulus is repeated at such distant intervals of time, that the"|FALSE
15707|"natural quantity of sensorial power becomes completely restored in the"|FALSE
15707|"acting fibres, it will act with the same energy as when first applied."|FALSE
15707|"Hence those who have lately accustomed themselves to large doses of opium"|FALSE
15707|"by beginning with small ones, and gradually increasing them, and repeating"|FALSE
15707|"them frequently, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph; if they intermit"|FALSE
15707|"the use of it for a few days only, must begin again with as small doses as"|FALSE
15707|"they took at first, otherwise they will experience the inconveniences of"|FALSE
15707|"intoxication."|FALSE
15707|"On this circumstance depend the constant unfailing effects of the various"|FALSE
15707|"kinds of stimulus, which excite into action all the vascular systems in the"|FALSE
15707|"body; the arterial, venous, absorbent, and glandular vessels, are brought"|FALSE
15707|"into perpetual unwearied action by the fluids, which are adapted to"|FALSE
15707|"stimulate them; but these have the sensorial power of association added to"|FALSE
15707|"that of irritation, and even in some degree that of sensation, and even of"|FALSE
15707|"volition, as will be spoken of in their places; and life itself is thus"|FALSE
15707|"carried on by the production of sensorial power being equal to its waste or"|FALSE
15707|"expenditure in the perpetual movement of the vascular organization."|FALSE
15707|"3. When a stimulus is repeated at uniform intervals of time with such"|FALSE
15707|"distances between them, that the expenditure of sensorial power in the"|FALSE
15707|"acting fibres becomes completely renewed, the effect is produced with"|FALSE
15707|"greater facility or energy. For the sensorial power of association is"|FALSE
15707|"combined with the sensorial power of irritation, or, in common language,"|FALSE
15707|"the acquired habit assists the power of the stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"This circumstance not only obtains in the annual and diurnal catenations of"|FALSE
15707|"animal motions explained in Sect. XXXVI. but in every less circle of"|FALSE
15707|"actions or ideas, as in the burthen of a song, or the iterations of a"|FALSE
15707|"dance; and constitutes the pleasure we receive from repetition and"|FALSE
15707|"imitation; as treated of in Sect. XXII. 2."|FALSE
15707|"4. When a stimulus has been many times repeated at uniform intervals, so as"|FALSE
15707|"to produce the complete action of the organ, it may then be gradually"|FALSE
15707|"diminished, or totally withdrawn, and the action of the organ will"|FALSE
15707|"continue. For the sensorial power of association becomes united with that"|FALSE
15707|"of irritation, and by frequent repetition becomes at length of sufficient"|FALSE
15707|"energy to carry on the new link in the circle of actions, without the"|FALSE
15707|"irritation which at first introduced it."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, when the bark is given at stated intervals for the cure of"|FALSE
15707|"intermittent fevers, if sixty grains of it be given every three hours for"|FALSE
15707|"the twenty-four hours preceding the expected paroxysm, so as to stimulate"|FALSE
15707|"the defective part of the system into action, and by that means to prevent"|FALSE
15707|"the torpor or quiescence of the fibres, which constitutes the cold fit;"|FALSE
15707|"much less than half the quantity, given before the time at which another"|FALSE
15707|"paroxysm of quiescence would have taken place, will be sufficient to"|FALSE
15707|"prevent it; because now the sensorial power, termed association, acts in a"|FALSE
15707|"twofold manner. First, in respect to the period of the catenation in which"|FALSE
15707|"the cold fit was produced, which is now dissevered by the stronger stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"of the first doses of the bark; and, secondly, because each dose of bark"|FALSE
15707|"being repeated at periodical times, has its effect increased by the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial faculty of association being combined with that of irritation."|FALSE
15707|"Now, when sixty grains of Peruvian bark are taken twice a day, suppose at"|FALSE
15707|"ten o'clock and at six, for a fortnight, the irritation excited by this"|FALSE
15707|"additional stimulus becomes a part of the diurnal circle of actions, and"|FALSE
15707|"will at length carry on the increased action of the system without the"|FALSE
15707|"assistance of the stimulus of the bark. On this theory the bitter"|FALSE
15707|"medicines, chalybeates, and opiates in appropriated doses, exhibited for a"|FALSE
15707|"fortnight, give permanent strength to pale feeble children, and other weak"|FALSE
15707|"constitutions."|FALSE
15707|"5. When a defect of stimulus, as of heat, recurs at certain diurnal"|FALSE
15707|"intervals, which induces some torpor or quiescence of a part of the system,"|FALSE
15707|"the diurnal catenation of actions becomes disordered, and a new association"|FALSE
15707|"with this link of torpid action is formed; on the next period the quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of quiescence will be increased, suppose the same defect of stimulus to"|FALSE
15707|"recur, because now the new association conspires with the defective"|FALSE
15707|"irritation in introducing the torpid action of this part of the diurnal"|FALSE
15707|"catenation. In this manner many fever-fits commence, where the patient is"|FALSE
15707|"for some days indisposed at certain hours, before the cold paroxysm of"|FALSE
15707|"fever is completely formed. See Sect. XVII. 3. 3. on Catenation of Animal"|FALSE
15707|"Motions."|FALSE
15707|"6. If a stimulus, which at first excited the affected organ into so great"|FALSE
15707|"exertion as to produce sensation, be continued for a certain time, it will"|FALSE
15707|"cease to produce sensation both then and when repeated, though the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative motions in consequence of it may continue or be re-excited."|FALSE
15707|"Many catenations of irritative motions were at first succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, as the apparent motions of objects when we walk past them, and"|FALSE
15707|"probably the vital motions themselves in the early state of our existence."|FALSE
15707|"But as those sensations were followed by no movements of the system in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of them, they gradually ceased to be produced, not being joined"|FALSE
15707|"to any succeeding link of catenation. Hence contagious matter, which has"|FALSE
15707|"for some weeks stimulated the system into great and permanent sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"ceases afterwards to produce general sensation, or inflammation, though it"|FALSE
15707|"may still induce topical irritations. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 8. XIX. 9."|FALSE
15707|"Our absorbent system then seems to receive those contagious matters, which"|FALSE
15707|"it has before experienced, in the same manner as it imbibes common moisture"|FALSE
15707|"or other fluids; that is, without being thrown into so violent action as to"|FALSE
15707|"produce sensation; the consequence of which is an increase of daily energy"|FALSE
15707|"or activity, till inflammation and its consequences succeed."|FALSE
15707|"7. If a stimulus excites an organ into such violent contractions as to"|FALSE
15707|"produce sensation, the motions of which organ had not usually produced"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, this new sensorial power, added to the irritation occasioned by"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus, increases the activity of the organ. And if this activity be"|FALSE
15707|"catenated with the diurnal circle of actions, an increasing inflammation is"|FALSE
15707|"produced; as in the evening paroxysms of small-pox, and other fevers with"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation. And hence schirrous tumours, tendons and membranes, and"|FALSE
15707|"probably the arteries themselves become inflamed, when they are strongly"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated."|FALSE
15707|"IV. _Of Stimulus greater than natural._"|FALSE
15707|"1. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increased"|FALSE
15707|"exertion of sensorial power, whether that exertion be in the mode of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, sensation, volition, or association, diminishes the general"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of it. This fact is observable in the progress of intoxication, as"|FALSE
15707|"the increased quantity or energy of the irritative motions, owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of vinous spirit, introduces much pleasurable sensation into the"|FALSE
15707|"system, and much exertion of muscular or sensual motions in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"this increased sensation; the voluntary motions, and even the associate"|FALSE
15707|"ones, become much impaired or diminished; and delirium and staggering"|FALSE
15707|"succeed. See Sect. XXI. on Drunkenness. And hence the great prostration of"|FALSE
15707|"the strength of the locomotive muscles in some fevers, is owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"exhaustion of sensorial power by the increased action of the arterial"|FALSE
15707|"system."|FALSE
15707|"In like manner a stimulus greater than natural, applied to a part of the"|FALSE
15707|"system, increases the exertion of sensorial power in that part, and"|FALSE
15707|"diminishes it in some other part. As in the commencement of scarlet fever,"|FALSE
15707|"it is usual to see great redness and heat on the faces and breasts of"|FALSE
15707|"children, while at the same time their feet are colder than natural;"|FALSE
15707|"partial heats are observable in other fevers with debility, and are"|FALSE
15707|"generally attended with torpor or quiescence of some other part of the"|FALSE
15707|"system. But these partial exertions of sensorial power are sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"attended with increased partial exertions in other parts of the system,"|FALSE
15707|"which sympathize with them, as the flushing of the face after a full meal."|FALSE
15707|"Both these therefore are to be ascribed to sympathetic associations,"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XXXV. and not to general exhaustion or accumulation of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"2. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increased"|FALSE
15707|"exertion of sensorial power in any particular organ, diminishes the"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of it in that organ. This appears from the contractions of animal"|FALSE
15707|"fibres being not so easily excited by a less stimulus after the organ has"|FALSE
15707|"been subjected to a greater. Thus after looking at any luminous object of a"|FALSE
15707|"small size, as at the setting sun, for a short time, so as not much to"|FALSE
15707|"fatigue the eye, this part of the retina becomes less sensible to smaller"|FALSE
15707|"quantities of light; hence when the eyes are turned on other less luminous"|FALSE
15707|"parts of the sky, a dark spot is seen resembling the shape of the sun, or"|FALSE
15707|"other luminous object which we last behold. See Sect. XL. No. 2."|FALSE
15707|"Thus we are some time before we can distinguish objects in an obscure room"|FALSE
15707|"after coming from bright day-light, though the iris presently contracts"|FALSE
15707|"itself. We are not able to hear weak sounds after loud ones. And the"|FALSE
15707|"stomachs of those who have been much habituated to the stronger stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"fermented or spirituous liquors, are not excited into due action by weaker"|FALSE
15707|"ones."|FALSE
15707|"3. A quantity of stimulus something greater than the last mentioned, or"|FALSE
15707|"longer continued, induces the organ into spasmodic action, which ceases and"|FALSE
15707|"recurs alternately. Thus on looking for a time on the setting sun, so as"|FALSE
15707|"not greatly to fatigue the sight, a yellow spectrum is seen when the eyes"|FALSE
15707|"are closed and covered, which continues for a time, and then disappears and"|FALSE
15707|"recurs repeatedly before it entirely vanishes. See Sect. XL. No. 5. Thus"|FALSE
15707|"the action of vomiting ceases and is renewed by intervals, although the"|FALSE
15707|"emetic drug is thrown up with the first effort. A tenesmus continues by"|FALSE
15707|"intervals some time after the exclusion of acrid excrement; and the"|FALSE
15707|"pulsations of the heart of a viper are said to continue some time after it"|FALSE
15707|"is cleared from its blood."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce pain"|FALSE
15707|"according to law 4; and this pain constitutes an additional kind or"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of excitement, which again induces the fibres into contraction,"|FALSE
15707|"and which painful excitement is again renewed, and again induces"|FALSE
15707|"contractions of the fibres with gradually diminishing effect."|FALSE
15707|"4. A quantity of stimulus greater than that last mentioned, or longer"|FALSE
15707|"continued, induces the antagonist muscles into spasmodic action. This is"|FALSE
15707|"beautifully illustrated by the ocular spectra described in Sect. XL. No. 6."|FALSE
15707|"to which the reader is referred. From those experiments there is reason to"|FALSE
15707|"conclude that the fatigued part of the retina throws itself into a contrary"|FALSE
15707|"mode of action like oscitation or pandiculation, as soon as the stimulus,"|FALSE
15707|"which has fatigued it, is withdrawn; but that it still remains liable to be"|FALSE
15707|"excited into action by any other colours except the colour with which it"|FALSE
15707|"has been fatigued. Thus the yawning and stretching the limbs after a"|FALSE
15707|"continued action or attitude seems occasioned by the antagonist muscles"|FALSE
15707|"being stimulated by their extension during the contractions of those in"|FALSE
15707|"action, or in the situation in which that action last left them."|FALSE
15707|"5. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,"|FALSE
15707|"induces variety of convulsions or fixed spasms either of the affected organ"|FALSE
15707|"or of the moving fibres in the other parts of the body. In respect to the"|FALSE
15707|"spectra in the eye, this is well illustrated in No. 7 and 8, of Sect. XL."|FALSE
15707|"Epileptic convulsions, as the emprosthotonos and opisthotonos, with the"|FALSE
15707|"cramp of the calf of the leg, locked jaw, and other cataleptic fits, appear"|FALSE
15707|"to originate from pain, as some of these patients scream aloud before the"|FALSE
15707|"convulsion takes place; which seems at first to be an effort to relieve"|FALSE
15707|"painful sensation, and afterwards an effort to prevent it."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce so much pain,"|FALSE
15707|"as to constitute a perpetual excitement; and that in so great a degree as"|FALSE
15707|"to allow but small intervals of relaxation of the contracting fibres as in"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions, or no intervals at all as in fixed spasms."|FALSE
15707|"6. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,"|FALSE
15707|"produces a paralysis of the organ. In many cases this paralysis is only a"|FALSE
15707|"temporary effect, as on looking long on a small area of bright red silk"|FALSE
15707|"placed on a sheet of white paper on the floor in a strong light, the red"|FALSE
15707|"silk gradually becomes paler, and at length disappears; which evinces that"|FALSE
15707|"a part of the retina, by being violently excited, becomes for a time"|FALSE
15707|"unaffected by the stimulus of that colour. Thus cathartic medicines,"|FALSE
15707|"opiates, poisons, contagious matter, cease to influence our system after it"|FALSE
15707|"has been habituated to the use of them, except by the exhibition of"|FALSE
15707|"increased quantities of them; our fibres not only become unaffected by"|FALSE
15707|"stimuli, by which they have previously been violently irritated, as by the"|FALSE
15707|"matter of the small-pox or measles; but they also become unaffected by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, where the violent exertions, which disabled them, were in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of too great quantity of sensation. And lastly the fibres,"|FALSE
15707|"which become disobedient to volition, are probably disabled by their too"|FALSE
15707|"violent exertions in consequence of too great a quantity of volition."|FALSE
15707|"After every exertion of our fibres a temporary paralysis succeeds, whence"|FALSE
15707|"the intervals of all muscular contractions, as mentioned in No. 3 and 4 of"|FALSE
15707|"this Section; the immediate cause of these more permanent kinds of"|FALSE
15707|"paralysis is probably owing in the same manner to the too great exhaustion"|FALSE
15707|"of the spirit of animation in the affected part; so that a stronger"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus is required, or one of a different kind from that, which"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned those too violent contractions, to again excite the affected"|FALSE
15707|"organ into activity; and if a stronger stimulus could be applied, it must"|FALSE
15707|"again induce paralysis."|FALSE
15707|"For these powerful stimuli excite pain at the same time, that they produce"|FALSE
15707|"irritation; and this pain not only excites fibrous motions by its stimulus,"|FALSE
15707|"but it also produces volition; and thus all these stimuli acting at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time, and sometimes with the addition of their associations, produce"|FALSE
15707|"so great exertion as to expend the whole of the sensorial power in the"|FALSE
15707|"affected fibres."|FALSE
15707|"V. _Of Stimulus less than natural._"|FALSE
15707|"1. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, producing a decreased exertion"|FALSE
15707|"of sensorial power, occasions an accumulation of the general quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"it. This circumstance is observable in the hemiplagia, in which the"|FALSE
15707|"patients are perpetually moving the muscles, which are unaffected. On this"|FALSE
15707|"account we awake with greater vigour after sleep, because during so many"|FALSE
15707|"hours, the great usual expenditure of sensorial power in the performance of"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary actions, and in the exertions of our organs of sense, in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of the irritations occasioned by external objects had been"|FALSE
15707|"suspended, and a consequent accumulation had taken place."|FALSE
15707|"In like manner the exertion of the sensorial power less than natural in one"|FALSE
15707|"part of the system, is liable to produce an increase of the exertion of it"|FALSE
15707|"in some other part. Thus by the action of vomiting, in which the natural"|FALSE
15707|"exertion of the motions of the stomach are destroyed or diminished, an"|FALSE
15707|"increased absorption of the pulmonary and cellular lymphatics is produced,"|FALSE
15707|"as is known by the increased absorption of the fluid deposited in them in"|FALSE
15707|"dropsical cases. But these partial quiescences of sensorial power are also"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes attended with other partial quiescences, which sympathize with"|FALSE
15707|"them, as cold and pale extremities from hunger. These therefore are to be"|FALSE
15707|"ascribed to the associations of sympathy explained in Sect. XXXV. and not"|FALSE
15707|"to the general accumulation of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"2. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, applied to fibres previously"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed to perpetual stimulus, is succeeded by accumulation of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power in the affected organ. The truth of this proposition is evinced,"|FALSE
15707|"because a stimulus less than natural, if it be somewhat greater than that"|FALSE
15707|"above mentioned, will excite the organ so circumstanced into violent"|FALSE
15707|"activity. Thus on a frosty day with wind, the face of a person exposed to"|FALSE
15707|"the wind is at first pale and shrunk; but on turning the face from the"|FALSE
15707|"wind, it becomes soon of a glow with warmth and flushing. The glow of the"|FALSE
15707|"skin in emerging from the cold-bath is owing to the same cause."|FALSE
15707|"It does not appear, that an accumulation of sensorial power above the"|FALSE
15707|"natural quantity is acquired by those muscles, which are not subject to"|FALSE
15707|"perpetual stimulus, as the locomotive muscles: these, after the greatest"|FALSE
15707|"fatigue, only acquire by rest their usual aptitude to motion; whereas the"|FALSE
15707|"vascular system, as the heart and arteries, after a short quiescence, are"|FALSE
15707|"thrown into violent action by their natural quantity of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"Nevertheless by this accumulation of sensorial power during the application"|FALSE
15707|"of decreased stimulus, and by the exhaustion of it during the action of"|FALSE
15707|"increased stimulus, it is wisely provided, that the actions of the vascular"|FALSE
15707|"muscles and organs of sense are not much deranged by small variations of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus; as the quantity of sensorial power becomes in some measure"|FALSE
15707|"inversely as the quantity of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"3. A quantity of stimulus less than that mentioned above, and continued for"|FALSE
15707|"some time, induces pain in the affected organ, as the pain of cold in the"|FALSE
15707|"hands, when they are immersed in snow, is owing to a deficiency of the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulation of heat. Hunger is a pain from the deficiency of the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulation of food. Pain in the back at the commencement of ague-fits, and"|FALSE
15707|"the head-achs which attend feeble people, are pains from defect of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, and are hence relieved by opium, essential oils, spirit of wine."|FALSE
15707|"As the pains, which originate from defect of stimulus, only occur in those"|FALSE
15707|"parts of the system, which have been previously subjected to perpetual"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus; and as an accumulation of sensorial power is produced in the"|FALSE
15707|"quiescent organ along with the pain, as in cold or hunger, there is reason"|FALSE
15707|"to believe, that the pain is owing to the accumulation of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"For, in the locomotive muscles, in the retina of the eye, and other organs"|FALSE
15707|"of senses, no pain occurs from the absence of stimulus, nor any great"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of sensorial power beyond their natural quantity, since these"|FALSE
15707|"organs have not been used to a perpetual supply of it. There is indeed a"|FALSE
15707|"greater accumulation occurs in the organ of vision after its quiescence,"|FALSE
15707|"because it is subject to more constant stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"4. A certain quantity of stimulus less than natural induces the moving"|FALSE
15707|"organ into feebler and more frequent contractions, as mentioned in No. I."|FALSE
15707|"4. of this Section. For each contraction moving through a less space, or"|FALSE
15707|"with less force, that is, with less expenditure of the spirit of animation,"|FALSE
15707|"is sooner relaxed, and the spirit of animation derived at each interval"|FALSE
15707|"into the acting fibres being less, these intervals likewise become shorter."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the tremours of the hands of people accustomed to vinous spirit, till"|FALSE
15707|"they take their usual stimulus; hence the quick pulse in fevers attended"|FALSE
15707|"with debility, which is greater than in fevers attended with strength; in"|FALSE
15707|"the latter the pulse seldom beats above 120 times in a minute, in the"|FALSE
15707|"former it frequently exceeds 140."|FALSE
15707|"It must be observed, that in this and the two following articles the"|FALSE
15707|"decreased action of the system is probably more frequently occasioned by"|FALSE
15707|"deficiency in the quantity of sensorial power, than in the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus. Thus those feeble constitutions which have large pupils of their"|FALSE
15707|"eyes, and all who labour under nervous fevers, seem to owe their want of"|FALSE
15707|"natural quantity of activity in the system to the deficiency of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power; since, as far as can be seen, they frequently possess the natural"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"5. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, inverts"|FALSE
15707|"the order of successive fibrous contractions; as in vomiting the vermicular"|FALSE
15707|"motions of the stomach and duodenum are inverted, and their contents"|FALSE
15707|"ejected, which is probably owing to the exhaustion of the spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"animation in the acting muscles by a previous excessive stimulus, as by the"|FALSE
15707|"root of ipecacuanha, and the consequent defect of sensorial power. The same"|FALSE
15707|"retrograde motions affect the whole intestinal canal in ileus; and the"|FALSE
15707|"oesophagus in globus hystericus. See this further explained in Sect. XXIX."|FALSE
15707|"No. 11. on Retrograde Motions."|FALSE
15707|"I must observe, also, that something similar happens in the production of"|FALSE
15707|"our ideas, or sensual motions, when they are too weakly excited; when any"|FALSE
15707|"one is thinking intensely about one thing, and carelessly conversing about"|FALSE
15707|"another, he is liable to use the word of a contrary meaning to that which"|FALSE
15707|"he designed, as cold weather for hot weather, summer for winter."|FALSE
15707|"6. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, is"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded by paralysis, first of the voluntary and sensitive motions, and"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards of those of irritation, and of association, which constitutes"|FALSE
15707|"death."|FALSE
15707|"VI. _Cure of increased Exertion._"|FALSE
15707|"1. The cure, which nature has provided for the increased exertion of any"|FALSE
15707|"part of the system, consists in the consequent expenditure of the sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power. But as a greater torpor follows this exhaustion of sensorial power,"|FALSE
15707|"as explained in the next paragraph, and a greater exertion succeeds this"|FALSE
15707|"torpor, the constitution frequently sinks under these increasing librations"|FALSE
15707|"between exertion and quiescence; till at length complete quiescence, that"|FALSE
15707|"is, death, closes the scene."|FALSE
15707|"For, during the great exertion of the system in the hot fit of fever, an"|FALSE
15707|"increase of stimulus is produced from the greater momentum of the blood,"|FALSE
15707|"the greater distention of the heart and arteries, and the increased"|FALSE
15707|"production of heat, by the violent actions of the system occasioned by this"|FALSE
15707|"augmentation of stimulus, the sensorial power becomes diminished in a few"|FALSE
15707|"hours much beneath its natural quantity, the vessels at length cease to"|FALSE
15707|"obey even these great degrees of stimulus, as shewn in Sect. XL. 9. 1. and"|FALSE
15707|"a torpor of the whole or of a part of the system ensues."|FALSE
15707|"Now as this second cold fit commences with a greater deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power, it is also attended with a greater deficiency of stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"than in the preceding cold fit, that is, with less momentum of blood, less"|FALSE
15707|"distention of the heart. On this account the second cold fit becomes more"|FALSE
15707|"violent and of longer duration than the first; and as a greater"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of sensorial power must be produced before the system of"|FALSE
15707|"vessels will again obey the diminished stimulus, it follows, that the"|FALSE
15707|"second hot fit of fever will be more violent than the former one. And that"|FALSE
15707|"unless some other causes counteract either the violent exertions in the hot"|FALSE
15707|"fit, or the great torpor in the cold fit, life will at length be"|FALSE
15707|"extinguished by the expenditure of the whole of the sensorial power. And"|FALSE
15707|"from hence it appears, that the true means of curing fevers must be such as"|FALSE
15707|"decrease the action of the system in the hot fit, and increase it in the"|FALSE
15707|"cold fit; that is, such as prevent the too great diminution of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power in the hot fit, and the too great accumulation of it in the cold one."|FALSE
15707|"2. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much increased, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"hot fits of fever or inflammation, the following are the usual means of"|FALSE
15707|"relieving it. Decrease the irritations by blood-letting, and other"|FALSE
15707|"evacuations; by cold water taken into the stomach, or injected as an enema,"|FALSE
15707|"or used externally; by cold air breathed into the lungs, and diffused over"|FALSE
15707|"the skin; with food of less stimulus than the patient has been accustomed"|FALSE
15707|"to."|FALSE
15707|"3. As a cold fit, or paroxysm of inactivity of some parts of the system,"|FALSE
15707|"generally precedes the hot fit, or paroxysm of exertion, by which the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power becomes accumulated, this cold paroxysm should be prevented"|FALSE
15707|"by stimulant medicines and diet, as wine, opium, bark, warmth,"|FALSE
15707|"cheerfulness, anger, surprise."|FALSE
15707|"4. Excite into greater action some other part of the system, by which means"|FALSE
15707|"the spirit of animation may be in part expended, and thence the inordinate"|FALSE
15707|"actions of the diseased part may be lessened. Hence when a part of the skin"|FALSE
15707|"acts violently, as of the face in the eruption of the small-pox, if the"|FALSE
15707|"feet be cold they should be covered. Hence the use of a blister applied"|FALSE
15707|"near a topical inflammation. Hence opium and warm bath relieve pains both"|FALSE
15707|"from excess and defect of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"5. First increase the general stimulation above its natural quantity, which"|FALSE
15707|"may in some degree exhaust the spirit of animation, and then decrease the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulation beneath its natural quantity. Hence after sudorific medicines"|FALSE
15707|"and warm air, the application of refrigerants may have greater effect, if"|FALSE
15707|"they could be administered without danger of producing too great torpor of"|FALSE
15707|"some part of the system; as frequently happens to people in health from"|FALSE
15707|"coming out of a warm room into the cold air, by which a topical"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation in consequence of torpor of the mucous membrane of the nostril"|FALSE
15707|"is produced, and is termed a cold in the head."|FALSE
15707|"VII. _Cure of decreased Exertion._"|FALSE
15707|"1. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much decreased, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"cold fits of fever, a gradual accumulation of the spirit of animation takes"|FALSE
15707|"place; as occurs in all cases where inactivity or torpor of a part of the"|FALSE
15707|"system exists; this accumulation of sensorial power increases, till stimuli"|FALSE
15707|"less than natural are sufficient to throw it into action, then the cold fit"|FALSE
15707|"ceases; and from the action of the natural stimuli a hot one succeeds with"|FALSE
15707|"increased activity of the whole system."|FALSE
15707|"So in fainting fits, or syncope, there is a temporary deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial exertion, and a consequent quiescence of a great part of the"|FALSE
15707|"system. This quiescence continues, till the sensorial power becomes again"|FALSE
15707|"accumulated in the torpid organs; and then the usual diurnal stimuli excite"|FALSE
15707|"the revivescent parts again into action; but as this kind of quiescence"|FALSE
15707|"continues but a short time compared to the cold paroxysm of an ague, and"|FALSE
15707|"less affects the circulatory system, a less superabundancy of exertion"|FALSE
15707|"succeeds in the organs previously torpid, and a less excess of arterial"|FALSE
15707|"activity. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 6."|FALSE
15707|"2. In the diseases occasioned by a defect of sensorial exertion, as in cold"|FALSE
15707|"fits of ague, hysteric complaint, and nervous fever, the following means"|FALSE
15707|"are those commonly used. 1. Increase the stimulation above its natural"|FALSE
15707|"quantity for some weeks, till a new habit of more energetic contraction of"|FALSE
15707|"the fibres is established. This is to be done by wine, opium, bark, steel,"|FALSE
15707|"given at exact periods, and in appropriate quantities; for if these"|FALSE
15707|"medicines be given in such quantity, as to induce the least degree of"|FALSE
15707|"intoxication, a debility succeeds from the useless exhaustion of spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"animation in consequence of too great exertion of the muscles or organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense. To these irritative stimuli should be added the sensitive ones of"|FALSE
15707|"cheerful ideas, hope, affection."|FALSE
15707|"3. Change the kinds of stimulus. The habits acquired by the constitution"|FALSE
15707|"depend on such nice circumstances, that when one kind of stimulus ceases to"|FALSE
15707|"excite the sensorial power into the quantity of exertion necessary to"|FALSE
15707|"health, it is often sufficient to change the stimulus for another"|FALSE
15707|"apparently similar in quantity and quality. Thus when wine ceases to"|FALSE
15707|"stimulate the constitution, opium in appropriate doses supplies the defect;"|FALSE
15707|"and the contrary. This is also observed in the effects of cathartic"|FALSE
15707|"medicines, when one loses its power, another, apparently less efficacious,"|FALSE
15707|"will succeed. Hence a change of diet, drink, and stimulating medicines, is"|FALSE
15707|"often advantageous in diseases of debility."|FALSE
15707|"4. Stimulate the organs, whose motions are associated with the torpid parts"|FALSE
15707|"of the system. The actions of the minute vessels of the various parts of"|FALSE
15707|"the external skin are not only associated with each other, but are strongly"|FALSE
15707|"associated with those of some of the internal membranes, and particularly"|FALSE
15707|"of the stomach. Hence when the exertion of the stomach is less than"|FALSE
15707|"natural, and indigestion and heartburn succeed, nothing so certainly"|FALSE
15707|"removes these symptoms as the stimulus of a blister on the back. The"|FALSE
15707|"coldness of the extremities, as of the nose, ears, or fingers, are hence"|FALSE
15707|"the best indication for the successful application of blisters."|FALSE
15707|"5. Decrease the stimulus for a time. By lessening the quantity of heat for"|FALSE
15707|"a minute or two by going into the cold bath, a great accumulation of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power is produced; for not only the minute vessels of the whole"|FALSE
15707|"external skin for a time become inactive, as appears by their paleness; but"|FALSE
15707|"the minute vessels of the lungs lose much of their activity also by concert"|FALSE
15707|"with those of the skin, as appears from the difficulty of breathing at"|FALSE
15707|"first going into cold water. On emerging from the bath the sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"is thrown into great exertion by the stimulus of the common degree of the"|FALSE
15707|"warmth of the atmosphere, and a great production of animal heat is the"|FALSE
15707|"consequence. The longer a person continues in the cold bath the greater"|FALSE
15707|"must be the present inertion of a great part of the system, and in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence a greater accumulation of sensorial power. Whence M. Pomè"|FALSE
15707|"recommends some melancholy patients to be kept from two to six hours in"|FALSE
15707|"spring-water, and in baths still colder."|FALSE
15707|"6. Decrease the stimulus for a time below the natural, and then increase it"|FALSE
15707|"above natural. The effect of this process, improperly used, is seen in"|FALSE
15707|"giving much food, or applying much warmth, to those who have been"|FALSE
15707|"previously exposed to great hunger, or to great cold. The accumulated"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power is thrown into so violent exertion, that inflammations and"|FALSE
15707|"mortifications supervene, and death closes the catastrophe. In many"|FALSE
15707|"diseases this method is the most successful; hence the bark in agues"|FALSE
15707|"produces more certain effect after the previous exhibition of emetics. In"|FALSE
15707|"diseases attended with violent pain, opium has double the effect, if"|FALSE
15707|"venesection and a cathartic have been previously used. On this seems to"|FALSE
15707|"have been founded the successful practice of Sydenham, who used venesection"|FALSE
15707|"and a cathartic in chlorosis before the exhibition of the bark, steel, and"|FALSE
15707|"opiates."|FALSE
15707|"7. Prevent any unnecessary expenditure of sensorial power. Hence in fevers"|FALSE
15707|"with debility, a decumbent posture is preferred, with silence, little"|FALSE
15707|"light, and such a quantity of heat as may prevent any chill sensation, or"|FALSE
15707|"any coldness of the extremities. The pulse of patients in fevers with"|FALSE
15707|"debility increases in frequency above ten pulsations in a minute on their"|FALSE
15707|"rising out of bed. For the expenditure of sensorial power to preserve an"|FALSE
15707|"erect posture of the body adds to the general deficiency of it, and thus"|FALSE
15707|"affects the circulation."|FALSE
15707|"8. The longer in time and the greater in degree the quiescence or inertion"|FALSE
15707|"of an organ has been, so that it still retains life or excitability, the"|FALSE
15707|"less stimulus should at first be applied to it. The quantity of stimulation"|FALSE
15707|"is a matter of great nicety to determine, where the torpor or quiescence of"|FALSE
15707|"the fibres has been experienced in a great degree, or for a considerable"|FALSE
15707|"time, as in cold fits of the ague, in continued fevers with great debility,"|FALSE
15707|"or in people famished at sea, or perishing with cold. In the two last"|FALSE
15707|"cases, very minute quantities of food should be first supplied, and very"|FALSE
15707|"few additional degrees of heat. In the two former cases, but little"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of wine or medicine, above what they had been lately accustomed"|FALSE
15707|"to, should be exhibited, and this at frequent and stated intervals, so that"|FALSE
15707|"the effect of one quantity may be observed before the exhibition of"|FALSE
15707|"another."|FALSE
15707|"If these circumstances are not attended to, as the sensorial power becomes"|FALSE
15707|"accumulated in the quiescent fibres, an inordinate exertion takes place by"|FALSE
15707|"the increase of stimulus acting on the accumulated quantity of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, and either the paralysis, or death of the contractile fibres ensues,"|FALSE
15707|"from the total expenditure of the sensorial power in the affected organ,"|FALSE
15707|"owing to this increase of exertion, like the debility after intoxication."|FALSE
15707|"Or, secondly, the violent exertions above mentioned produce painful"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, which becomes a new stimulus, and by thus producing"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation, and increasing the activity of the fibres already too great,"|FALSE
15707|"sooner exhausts the whole of the sensorial power in the acting organ, and"|FALSE
15707|"mortification, that is, the death of the part, supervenes."|FALSE
15707|"Hence there have been many instances of people, whose limbs have been long"|FALSE
15707|"benumbed by exposure to cold, who have lost them by mortification on their"|FALSE
15707|"being too hastily brought to the fire; and of others, who were nearly"|FALSE
15707|"famished at sea, who have died soon after having taken not more than an"|FALSE
15707|"usual meal of food. I have heard of two well-attested instances of patients"|FALSE
15707|"in the cold fit of ague, who have died from the exhibition of gin and"|FALSE
15707|"vinegar, by the inflammation which ensued. And in many fevers attended with"|FALSE
15707|"debility, the unlimited use of wine, and the wanton application of"|FALSE
15707|"blisters, I believe, has destroyed numbers by the debility consequent to"|FALSE
15707|"too great stimulation, that is, by the exhaustion of the sensorial power by"|FALSE
15707|"its inordinate exertion."|FALSE
15707|"Wherever the least degree of intoxication exists, a proportional debility"|FALSE
15707|"is the consequence; but there is a golden rule by which the necessary and"|FALSE
15707|"useful quantity of stimulus in fevers with debility may be ascertained."|FALSE
15707|"When wine or beer are exhibited either alone or diluted with water, if the"|FALSE
15707|"pulse becomes slower the stimulus is of a proper quantity; and should be"|FALSE
15707|"repeated every two or three hours, or when the pulse again becomes quicker."|FALSE
15707|"In the chronical debility brought on by drinking spirituous or fermented"|FALSE
15707|"liquors, there is another golden rule by which I have successfully directed"|FALSE
15707|"the quantity of spirit which they may safely lessen, for there is no other"|FALSE
15707|"means by which they can recover their health. It should be premised, that"|FALSE
15707|"where the power of digestion in these patients is totally destroyed, there"|FALSE
15707|"is not much reason to expect a return to healthful vigour."|FALSE
15707|"I have directed several of these patients to omit one fourth part of the"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of vinous spirit they have been lately accustomed to, and if in a"|FALSE
15707|"fortnight their appetite increases, they are advised to omit another fourth"|FALSE
15707|"part; but if they perceive that their digestion becomes impaired from the"|FALSE
15707|"want of this quantity of spirituous potation, they are advised to continue"|FALSE
15707|"as they are, and rather bear the ills they have, than risk the encounter of"|FALSE
15707|"greater. At the same time flesh-meat with or without spice is recommended,"|FALSE
15707|"with Peruvian bark and steel in small quantities between their meals, and"|FALSE
15707|"half a grain of opium or a grain, with five or eight grains of rhubarb at"|FALSE
15707|"night."|FALSE

15707|"are excitable into a variety of motion by irritations of external objects."|FALSE
15707|"This appears particularly in the mimosa or sensitive plant, whose leaves"|FALSE
15707|"contract on the slightest injury; the dionæa muscipula, which was lately"|FALSE
15707|"brought over from the marshes of America, presents us with another curious"|FALSE
15707|"instance of vegetable irritability; its leaves are armed with spines on"|FALSE
15707|"their upper edge, and are spread on the ground around the stem; when an"|FALSE
15707|"insect creeps on any of them in its passage to the flower or seed, the leaf"|FALSE
15707|"shuts up like a steel rat-trap, and destroys its enemy. See Botanic Garden,"|FALSE
15707|"Part II. note on Silene."|FALSE
15707|"The various secretions of vegetables, as of odour, fruit, gum, resin, wax,"|FALSE

15707|"and barks of vegetables is excited into action by the fluids applied to"|FALSE
15707|"their mouths like the lacteals and lymphatics of animals."|FALSE
15707|"2. The individuals of the vegetable world may be considered as inferior or"|FALSE
15707|"less perfect animals; a tree is a congeries of many living buds, and in"|FALSE
15707|"this respect resembles the branches of coralline, which are a congeries of"|FALSE
15707|"a multitude of animals. Each of these buds of a tree has its proper leaves"|FALSE
15707|"or petals for lungs, produces its viviparous or its oviparous offspring in"|FALSE
15707|"buds or seeds; has its own roots, which extending down the stem of the tree"|FALSE

15707|"superinduced upon the former bark, which then dies, and with its stagnated"|FALSE
15707|"juices gradually hardening into wood forms the concentric circles, which we"|FALSE
15707|"see in blocks of timber."|FALSE
15707|"The following circumstances evince the individuality of the buds of trees."|FALSE
15707|"First, there are many trees, whose whole internal wood is perished, and yet"|FALSE
15707|"the branches are vegete and healthy. Secondly, the fibres of the barks of"|FALSE
15707|"trees are chiefly longitudinal, resembling roots, as is beautifully seen in"|FALSE
15707|"those prepared barks, that were lately brought from Otaheita. Thirdly, in"|FALSE
15707|"horizontal wounds of the bark of trees, the fibres of the upper lip are"|FALSE
15707|"always elongated downwards like roots, but those of the lower lip do not"|FALSE
15707|"approach to meet them. Fourthly, if you wrap wet moss round any joint of a"|FALSE
15707|"vine, or cover it with moist earth, roots will shoot out from it. Fifthly,"|FALSE
15707|"by the inoculation or engrafting of trees many fruits are produced from one"|FALSE
15707|"stem. Sixthly, a new tree is produced from a branch plucked from an old"|FALSE
15707|"one, and set in the ground. Whence it appears that the buds of deciduous"|FALSE
15707|"trees are so many annual plants, that the bark is a contexture of the roots"|FALSE
15707|"of each individual bud; and that the internal wood is of no other use but"|FALSE
15707|"to support them in the air, and that thus they resemble the animal world in"|FALSE

15707|"The irritability of plants, like that of animals, appears liable to be"|FALSE

15707|"potatoes and onions, germinate with less heat in spring, after they have"|FALSE
15707|"been accustomed to the winter's cold, than in autumn after the summer's"|FALSE
15707|"heat."|FALSE
15707|"II. The stamens and pistils of flowers shew evident marks of sensibility,"|FALSE

15707|"petals and calyxes during the cold parts of the day. For this cannot be"|FALSE
15707|"ascribed to irritation, because cold means a defect of the stimulus of"|FALSE

15707|"love, and hence belongs to sensation, not to irritation."|FALSE
15707|"III. That the vegetable world possesses some degree of voluntary powers,"|FALSE
15707|"appears from their necessity to sleep, which we have shewn in Sect. XVIII."|FALSE
15707|"to consist in the temporary abolition of voluntary power. This voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"power seems to be exerted in the circular movement of the tendrils of"|FALSE
15707|"vines, and other climbing vegetables; or in the efforts to turn the upper"|FALSE
15707|"surface of their leaves, or their flowers to the light."|FALSE
15707|"IV. The associations of fibrous motions are observable in the vegetable"|FALSE
15707|"world, as well as in the animal. The divisions of the leaves of the"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive plant have been accustomed to contract at the same time from the"|FALSE
15707|"absence of light; hence if by any other circumstance, as a slight stroke or"|FALSE
15707|"injury, one division is irritated into contraction, the neighbouring ones"|FALSE
15707|"contract also, from their motions being associated with those of the"|FALSE
15707|"irritated part. So the various stamina of the class of syngenesia have been"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed to contract together in the evening, and thence if you stimulate"|FALSE
15707|"one of them with a pin, according to the experiment of M. Colvolo, they all"|FALSE
15707|"contract from their acquired associations."|FALSE
15707|"To evince that the collapsing of the sensitive plant is not owing to any"|FALSE
15707|"mechanical vibrations propagated along the whole branch, when a single leaf"|FALSE
15707|"is struck with the finger, a leaf of it was slit with sharp scissors, and"|FALSE
15707|"some seconds of time passed before the plant seemed sensible of the injury;"|FALSE
15707|"and then the whole branch collapsed as far as the principal stem: this"|FALSE
15707|"experiment was repeated several times with the least possible impulse to"|FALSE
15707|"the plant."|FALSE
15707|"V. 1. For the numerous circumstances in which vegetable buds are analogous"|FALSE
15707|"to animals, the reader is referred to the additional notes at the end of"|FALSE
15707|"the Botanic Garden, Part I. It is there shewn, that the roots of vegetables"|FALSE
15707|"resemble the lacteal system of animals; the sap-vessels in the early"|FALSE
15707|"spring, before their leaves expand, are analogous to the placental vessels"|FALSE
15707|"of the foetus; that the leaves of land-plants resemble lungs, and those of"|FALSE
15707|"aquatic plants the gills of fish; that there are other systems of vessels"|FALSE
15707|"resembling the vena portarum of quadrupeds, or the aorta of fish; that the"|FALSE
15707|"digestive power of vegetables is similar to that of animals converting the"|FALSE
15707|"fluids, which they absorb, into sugar; that their seeds resemble the eggs"|FALSE
15707|"of animals, and their buds and bulbs their viviparous offspring. And,"|FALSE
15707|"lastly, that the anthers and stigmas are real animals, attached indeed to"|FALSE
15707|"their parent tree like polypi or coral insects, but capable of spontaneous"|FALSE
15707|"motion; that they are affected with the passion of love, and furnished with"|FALSE
15707|"powers of reproducing their species, and are fed with honey like the moths"|FALSE
15707|"and butterflies, which plunder their nectaries. See Botanic Garden, Part I."|FALSE
15707|"add. note XXXIX."|FALSE
15707|"The male flowers of vallisneria approach still nearer to apparent"|FALSE
15707|"animality, as they detach themselves from the parent plant, and float on"|FALSE
15707|"the surface of the water to the female ones. Botanic Garden, Part II. Art."|FALSE
15707|"Vallisneria. Other flowers of the classes of monecia and diecia, and"|FALSE
15707|"polygamia, discharge the fecundating farina, which floating in the air is"|FALSE
15707|"carried to the stigma of the female flowers, and that at considerable"|FALSE
15707|"distances. Can this be effected by any specific attraction? or, like the"|FALSE
15707|"diffusion of the odorous particles of flowers, is it left to the currents"|FALSE
15707|"of winds, and the accidental miscarriages of it counteracted by the"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of its production?"|FALSE
15707|"2. This leads us to a curious enquiry, whether vegetables have ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"external things? As all our ideas are originally received by our senses,"|FALSE
15707|"the question may be changed to, whether vegetables possess any organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense? Certain it is, that they possess a sense of heat and cold, another"|FALSE
15707|"of moisture and dryness, and another of light and darkness; for they close"|FALSE
15707|"their petals occasionally from the presence of cold, moisture, or darkness."|FALSE
15707|"And it has been already shewn, that these actions cannot be performed"|FALSE
15707|"simply from irritation, because cold and darkness are negative quantities,"|FALSE
15707|"and on that account sensation or volition are implied, and in consequence a"|FALSE
15707|"sensorium or union of their nerves. So when we go into the light, we"|FALSE
15707|"contract the iris; not from any stimulus of the light on the fine muscles"|FALSE
15707|"of the iris, but from its motions being associated with the sensation of"|FALSE
15707|"too much light on the retina: which could not take place without a"|FALSE
15707|"sensorium or center of union of the nerves of the iris with those of"|FALSE
15707|"vision. See Botanic Garden, Part I. Canto 3. l. 440. note."|FALSE
15707|"Besides these organs of sense, which distinguish cold, moisture, and"|FALSE
15707|"darkness, the leaves of mimosa, and of dionæa, and of drosera, and the"|FALSE
15707|"stamens of many flowers, as of the berbery, and the numerous class of"|FALSE
15707|"syngenesia, are sensible to mechanic impact, that is, they possess a sense"|FALSE
15707|"of touch, as well as a common sensorium; by the medium of which their"|FALSE
15707|"muscles are excited into action. Lastly, in many flowers the anthers, when"|FALSE
15707|"mature, approach the stigma, in others the female organ approaches to the"|FALSE
15707|"male. In a plant of collinsonia, a branch of which is now before me, the"|FALSE
15707|"two yellow stamens are about three eights of an inch high, and diverge from"|FALSE
15707|"each other, at an angle of about fifteen degrees, the purple style is half"|FALSE
15707|"an inch high, and in some flowers is now applied to the stamen on the right"|FALSE
15707|"hand, and in others to that of the left; and will, I suppose, change place"|FALSE
15707|"to-morrow in those, where the anthers have not yet effused their powder."|FALSE
15707|"I ask, by what means are the anthers in many flowers, and stigmas in other"|FALSE
15707|"flowers, directed to find their paramours? How do either of them know, that"|FALSE
15707|"the other exists in their vicinity? Is this curious kind of storge produced"|FALSE
15707|"by mechanic attraction, or by the sensation of love? The latter opinion is"|FALSE
15707|"supported by the strongest analogy, because a reproduction of the species"|FALSE
15707|"is the consequence; and then another organ of sense must be wanted to"|FALSE
15707|"direct these vegetable amourettes to find each other, one probably"|FALSE
15707|"analogous to our sense of smell, which in the animal world directs the"|FALSE
15707|"new-born infant to its source of nourishment, and they may thus possess a"|FALSE
15707|"faculty of perceiving as well as of producing odours."|FALSE
15707|"Thus, besides a kind of taste at the extremities of their roots, similar to"|FALSE
15707|"that of the extremities of our lacteal vessels, for the purpose of"|FALSE
15707|"selecting their proper food: and besides different kinds of irritability"|FALSE
15707|"residing in the various glands, which separate honey, wax, resin, and other"|FALSE
15707|"juices from their blood; vegetable life seems to possess an organ of sense"|FALSE
15707|"to distinguish the variations of heat, another to distinguish the varying"|FALSE
15707|"degrees of moisture, another of light, another of touch, and probably"|FALSE
15707|"another analogous to our sense of smell. To these must be added the"|FALSE
15707|"indubitable evidence of their passion of love, and I think we may truly"|FALSE
15707|"conclude, that they are furnished with a common sensorium belonging to each"|FALSE
15707|"bud and that they must occasionally repeat those perceptions either in"|FALSE
15707|"their dreams or waking hours, and consequently possess ideas of so many of"|FALSE

15707|"I. Philosophers have been much perplexed to understand, in what manner we"|FALSE
15707|"become acquainted with the external world; insomuch that Dr. Berkly even"|FALSE
15707|"doubted its existence, from having observed (as he thought) that none of"|FALSE
15707|"our ideas resemble their correspondent objects. Mr. Hume asserts, that our"|FALSE
15707|"belief depends on the greater distinctness or energy of our ideas from"|FALSE
15707|"perception; and Mr. Reid has lately contended, that our belief of external"|FALSE
15707|"objects is an innate principle necessarily joined with our perceptions."|FALSE
15707|"So true is the observation of the famous Malbranch, \"that our senses are"|FALSE

15707|"This immaterial agent is supposed to exist in or with matter, but to be"|FALSE
15707|"quite distinct from it, and to be equally capable of existence, after the"|FALSE

15707|"Nor is this theory ill supported by analogy, since heat, electricity, and"|FALSE

15707|"or sensorial power, I mean only that animal life, which mankind possesses"|FALSE
15707|"in common with brutes, and in some degree even with vegetables, and leave"|FALSE
15707|"the consideration of the immortal part of us, which is the object of"|FALSE
15707|"religion, to those who treat of revelation."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. _Of the Sense of Touch._"|FALSE
15707|"The first idea we become acquainted with, are those of the sense of touch;"|FALSE
15707|"for the foetus must experience some varieties of agitation, and exert some"|FALSE
15707|"muscular action, in the womb; and may with great probability be supposed"|FALSE
15707|"thus to gain some ideas of its own figure, of that of the uterus, and of"|FALSE
15707|"the tenacity of the fluid, that surrounds it, (as appears from the facts"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned in the succeeding Section upon Instinct.)"|FALSE
15707|"Many of the organs of sense are confined to a small part of the body, as"|FALSE
15707|"the nostrils, ear, or eye, whilst the sense of touch is diffused over the"|FALSE
15707|"whole skin, but exists with a more exquisite degree of delicacy at the"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of the fingers and thumbs, and in the lips. The sense of touch"|FALSE
15707|"is thus very commodiously disposed for the purpose of encompassing smaller"|FALSE
15707|"bodies, and for adapting itself to the inequalities of larger ones. The"|FALSE
15707|"figure of small bodies seems to be learnt by children by their lips as much"|FALSE
15707|"as by their fingers; on which account they put every new object to their"|FALSE
15707|"mouths, when they are satiated with food, as well as when they are hungry."|FALSE
15707|"And puppies seem to learn their ideas of figure principally by the lips in"|FALSE
15707|"their mode of play."|FALSE
15707|"We acquire our tangible ideas of objects either by the simple pressure of"|FALSE
15707|"this organ of touch against a solid body, or by moving our organ of touch"|FALSE
15707|"along the surface of it. In the former case we learn the length and breadth"|FALSE
15707|"of the object by the quantity of our organ of touch, that is impressed by"|FALSE
15707|"it: in the latter case we learn the length and breadth of objects by the"|FALSE
15707|"continuance of their pressure on our moving organ of touch."|FALSE
15707|"It is hence, that we are very slow in acquiring our tangible ideas, and"|FALSE
15707|"very slow in recollecting them; for if I now think of the tangible idea of"|FALSE
15707|"a cube, that is, if I think of its figure, and of the solidity of every"|FALSE
15707|"part of that figure, I must conceive myself as passing my fingers over it,"|FALSE
15707|"and seem in some measure to feel the idea, as I formerly did the"|FALSE
15707|"impression, at the ends of them, and am thus very slow in distinctly"|FALSE
15707|"recollecting it."|FALSE
15707|"When a body compresses any part of our sense of touch, what happens? First,"|FALSE
15707|"this part of our sensorium undergoes a mechanical compression, which is"|FALSE
15707|"termed a stimulus; secondly, an idea, or contraction of a part of the organ"|FALSE
15707|"of sense is excited; thirdly, a motion of the central parts, or of the"|FALSE
15707|"whole sensorium, which is termed sensation, is produced; and these three"|FALSE
15707|"constitute the perception of solidity."|FALSE
15707|"2. _Of Figure, Motion, Time, Place, Space, Number._"|FALSE
15707|"No one will deny, that the medulla of the brain and nerves has a certain"|FALSE
15707|"figure; which, as it is diffused through nearly the whole of the body, must"|FALSE
15707|"have nearly the figure of that body. Now it follows, that the spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"animation, or living principle, as it occupies this medulla, and no other"|FALSE
15707|"part, (which is evinced by a great variety of cruel experiments on living"|FALSE
15707|"animals,) it follows, that this spirit of animation has also the same"|FALSE
15707|"figure as the medulla above described. I appeal to common sense! the spirit"|FALSE
15707|"of animation acts, Where does it act? It acts wherever there is the medulla"|FALSE
15707|"above mentioned; and that whether the limb is yet joined to a living"|FALSE
15707|"animal, or whether it be recently detached from it; as the heart of a viper"|FALSE
15707|"or frog will renew its contractions, when pricked with a pin, for many"|FALSE
15707|"minutes of time after its exsection from the body.--Does it act any where"|FALSE
15707|"else?--No; then it certainly exists in this part of space, and no where"|FALSE
15707|"else; that is, it hath figure; namely, the figure of the nervous system,"|FALSE
15707|"which is nearly the figure of the body. When the idea of solidity is"|FALSE
15707|"excited, as above explained, a part of the extensive organ of touch is"|FALSE
15707|"compressed by some external body, and this part of the sensorium so"|FALSE
15707|"compressed exactly resembles _in figure_ the figure of the body that"|FALSE
15707|"compressed it. Hence, when we acquire the idea of solidity, we acquire at"|FALSE
15707|"the same time the idea of FIGURE; and this idea of figure, or motion of _a"|FALSE
15707|"part_ of the organ of touch, exactly resembles _in its figure_ the figure"|FALSE
15707|"of the body that occasions it; and thus exactly acquaints us with this"|FALSE
15707|"property of the external world."|FALSE
15707|"Now, as the whole universe with all its parts possesses a certain form or"|FALSE
15707|"figure, if any part of it moves, that form or figure of the whole is"|FALSE
15707|"varied: hence, as MOTION is no other than a perpetual variation of figure,"|FALSE
15707|"our idea of motion is also a real resemblance of the motion that produced"|FALSE
15707|"it."|FALSE
15707|"It may be said in objection to this definition of motion, that an ivory"|FALSE
15707|"globe may revolve on its axis, and that here will be a motion without"|FALSE
15707|"change of figure. But the figure of the particle _x_ on one side of this"|FALSE
15707|"globe is not the _same_ figure as the figure of _y_ on the other side, any"|FALSE
15707|"more than the particles themselves are the same, though they are _similar_"|FALSE
15707|"figures; and hence they cannot change place with each other without"|FALSE
15707|"disturbing or changing the figure of the whole."|FALSE
15707|"Our idea of TIME is from the same source, but is more abstracted, as it"|FALSE
15707|"includes only the comparative velocities of these variations of figure;"|FALSE
15707|"hence if it be asked, How long was this book in printing? it may be"|FALSE
15707|"answered, Whilst the sun was passing through Aries."|FALSE
15707|"Our idea of PLACE includes only the figure of a group of bodies, not the"|FALSE
15707|"figures of the bodies themselves. If it be asked where is Nottinghamshire,"|FALSE
15707|"the answer is, it is surrounded by Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and"|FALSE
15707|"Leicestershire; hence place is our idea of the figure of one body"|FALSE
15707|"surrounded by the figures of other bodies."|FALSE
15707|"The idea of SPACE is a more abstracted idea of place excluding the group of"|FALSE
15707|"bodies."|FALSE
15707|"The idea of NUMBER includes only the particular arrangements, or"|FALSE
15707|"distributions of a group of bodies, and is therefore only a more abstracted"|FALSE
15707|"idea of the parts of the figure of the group of bodies; thus when I say"|FALSE
15707|"England is divided into forty counties, I only speak of certain divisions"|FALSE
15707|"of its figure."|FALSE
15707|"Hence arises the certainty of the mathematical sciences, as they explain"|FALSE
15707|"these properties of bodies, which are exactly resembled by our ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"them, whilst we are obliged to collect almost all our other knowledge from"|FALSE
15707|"experiment; that is, by observing the effects exerted by one body upon"|FALSE
15707|"another."|FALSE
15707|"3. _Of the Penetrability of Matter._"|FALSE
15707|"The impossibility of two bodies existing together in the same space cannot"|FALSE
15707|"be deduced from our idea of solidity, or of figure. As soon as we perceive"|FALSE
15707|"the motions of objects that surround us, and learn that we possess a power"|FALSE
15707|"to move our own bodies, we experience, that those objects, which excite in"|FALSE
15707|"us the idea of solidity and of figure, oppose this voluntary movement of"|FALSE
15707|"our own organs; as whilst I endeavour to compress between my hands an ivory"|FALSE
15707|"ball into a spheroid. And we are hence taught by experience, that our own"|FALSE
15707|"body and those, which we touch, cannot exist in the same part of space."|FALSE
15707|"But this by no means demonstrates, that no two bodies can exist together in"|FALSE
15707|"the same part of space. Galilæo in the preface to his works seems to be of"|FALSE
15707|"opinion, that matter is not impenetrable; Mr. Michel, and Mr. Boscowich in"|FALSE
15707|"his Theoria. Philos. Natur. have espoused this hypothesis: which has been"|FALSE
15707|"lately published by Dr. Priestley, to whom the world is much indebted for"|FALSE
15707|"so many important discoveries in science. (Hist. of Light and Colours, p."|FALSE
15707|"391.) The uninterrupted passage of light through transparent bodies, of the"|FALSE
15707|"electric æther through metallic and aqueous bodies, and of the magnetic"|FALSE
15707|"effluvia through all bodies, would seem to give some probability to this"|FALSE
15707|"opinion. Hence it appears, that beings may exist without possessing the"|FALSE
15707|"property of solidity, as well as they can exist without possessing the"|FALSE
15707|"properties, which excite our smell or taste, and can thence occupy space"|FALSE
15707|"without detruding other bodies from it; but we cannot become acquainted"|FALSE
15707|"with such beings by our sense of touch, any more than we can with odours or"|FALSE
15707|"flavours without our senses of smell and taste."|FALSE
15707|"But that any being can exist without existing in space, is to my ideas"|FALSE
15707|"utterly incomprehensible. My appeal is to common sense. _To be_ implies a"|FALSE
15707|"when and a where; the one is comparing it with the motions of other beings,"|FALSE
15707|"and the other with their situations."|FALSE
15707|"If there was but one object, as the whole creation may be considered as one"|FALSE
15707|"object, then I cannot ask where it exists? for there are no other objects"|FALSE
15707|"to compare its situation with. Hence if any one denies, that a being exists"|FALSE
15707|"in space, he denies, that there are any other beings but that one; for to"|FALSE
15707|"answer the question, \"Where does it exist?\" is only to mention the"|FALSE
15707|"situation of the objects that surround it."|FALSE
15707|"In the same manner if it be asked--\"When does a being exist?\" The answer"|FALSE
15707|"only specifies the successive motions either of itself, or of other bodies;"|FALSE
15707|"hence to say, a body exists not in time, is to say, that there is, or was,"|FALSE
15707|"no motion in the world."|FALSE
15707|"4. _Of the Spirit of Animation._"|FALSE
15707|"But though there may exist beings in the universe, that have not the"|FALSE
15707|"property of solidity; that is, which can possess any part of space, at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time that it is occupied by other bodies; yet there may be other"|FALSE
15707|"beings, that can assume this property of solidity, or disrobe themselves of"|FALSE
15707|"it occasionally, as we are taught of spirits, and of angels; and it would"|FALSE
15707|"seem, that THE SPIRIT OF ANIMATION must be endued with this property,"|FALSE
15707|"otherwise how could it occasionally give motion to the limbs of"|FALSE
15707|"animals?--or be itself stimulated into motion by the obtrusions of"|FALSE
15707|"surrounding bodies, as of light, or odour?"|FALSE
15707|"If the spirit of animation was always necessarily penetrable, it could not"|FALSE
15707|"influence or be influenced by the solidity of common matter; they would"|FALSE
15707|"exist together, but could not detrude each other from the part of space,"|FALSE
15707|"where they exist; that is, they could not communicate motion to each other."|FALSE
15707|"_No two things can influence or affect each other, which have not some"|FALSE
15707|"property common to both of them_; for to influence or affect another body"|FALSE
15707|"is to give or communicate some property to it, that it had not before; but"|FALSE
15707|"how can one body give that to another, which it does not possess"|FALSE
15707|"itself?--The words imply, that they must agree in having the power or"|FALSE
15707|"faculty of possessing some common property. Thus if one body removes"|FALSE
15707|"another from the part of space, that it possesses, it must have the power"|FALSE
15707|"of occupying that space itself: and if one body communicates heat or motion"|FALSE
15707|"to another, it follows, that they have alike the property of possessing"|FALSE
15707|"heat or motion."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the spirit of animation at the time it communicates or receives"|FALSE
15707|"motion from solid bodies, must itself possess some property of solidity."|FALSE
15707|"And in consequence at the time it receives other kinds of motion from"|FALSE
15707|"light, it must possess that property, which light possesses, to communicate"|FALSE
15707|"that kind of motion; and for which no language has a name, unless it may be"|FALSE
15707|"termed Visibility. And at the time it is stimulated into other kinds of"|FALSE
15707|"animal motion by the particles of sapid and odorous bodies affecting the"|FALSE
15707|"senses of taste and smell, it must resemble these particles of flavour, and"|FALSE
15707|"of odour, in possessing some similar or correspondent property; and for"|FALSE
15707|"which language has no name, unless we may use the words Saporosity and"|FALSE
15707|"Odorosity for those common properties, which are possessed by our organs of"|FALSE
15707|"taste and smell, and by the particles of sapid and odorous bodies; as the"|FALSE
15707|"words Tangibility and Audibility may express the common property possessed"|FALSE
15707|"by our organs of touch, and of hearing, and by the solid bodies, or their"|FALSE
15707|"vibrations, which affect those organs."|FALSE
15707|"5. Finally, though the figures of bodies are in truth resembled by the"|FALSE
15707|"figure of the part of the organ of touch, which is stimulated into motion;"|FALSE
15707|"and that organ resembles the solid body, which stimulates it, in its"|FALSE
15707|"property of solidity; and though the sense of hearing resembles the"|FALSE
15707|"vibrations of external bodies in its capability of being stimulated into"|FALSE
15707|"motion by those vibrations; and though our other organs of sense resemble"|FALSE
15707|"the bodies, that stimulate them, in their capability of being stimulated by"|FALSE
15707|"them; and we hence become acquainted with these properties of the external"|FALSE
15707|"world; yet as we can repeat all these motions of our organs of sense by the"|FALSE
15707|"efforts of volition, or in consequence of the sensation of pleasure or"|FALSE
15707|"pain, or by their association with other fibrous motions, as happens in our"|FALSE
15707|"reveries or in sleep, there would still appear to be some difficulty in"|FALSE
15707|"demonstrating the existence of any thing external to us."|FALSE
15707|"In our dreams we cannot determine this circumstance, because our power of"|FALSE
15707|"volition is suspended, and the stimuli of external objects are excluded;"|FALSE
15707|"but in our waking hours we can compare our ideas belonging to one sense"|FALSE
15707|"with those belonging to another, and can thus distinguish the ideas"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned by irritation from those excited by sensation, volition, or"|FALSE
15707|"association. Thus if the idea of the sweetness of sugar should be excited"|FALSE
15707|"in our dreams, the whiteness and hardness of it occur at the same time by"|FALSE
15707|"association; and we believe a material lump of sugar present before us. But"|FALSE
15707|"if, in our waking hours, the idea of the sweetness of sugar occurs to us,"|FALSE
15707|"the stimuli of surrounding objects, as the edge of the table, on which we"|FALSE
15707|"press, or green colour of the grass, on which we tread, prevent the other"|FALSE
15707|"ideas of the hardness and whiteness of the sugar from being exerted by"|FALSE
15707|"association. Or if they should occur, we voluntarily compare them with the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas of the table or grass above mentioned, and detect their"|FALSE
15707|"fallacy. We can thus distinguish the ideas caused by the stimuli of"|FALSE
15707|"external objects from those, which are introduced by association,"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, or volition; and during our waking hours can thus acquire a"|FALSE
15707|"knowledge of the external world. Which nevertheless we cannot do in our"|FALSE
15707|"dreams, because we have neither perceptions of external bodies, nor the"|FALSE
15707|"power of volition to enable us to compare them with the ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination."|FALSE
15707|"III. _Of Vision._"|FALSE
15707|"Our eyes observe a difference of colour, or of shade, in the prominences"|FALSE
15707|"and depressions of objects, and that those shades uniformly vary, when the"|FALSE
15707|"sense of touch observes any variation. Hence when the retina becomes"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated by colours or shades of light in a certain form, as in a"|FALSE
15707|"circular spot; we know by experience, that this is a sign, that a tangible"|FALSE
15707|"body is before us; and that its figure is resembled by the miniature figure"|FALSE
15707|"of the part of the organ of vision, that is thus stimulated."|FALSE
15707|"Here whilst the stimulated part of the retina resembles exactly the visible"|FALSE
15707|"figure of the whole in miniature, the various kinds of stimuli from"|FALSE
15707|"different colours mark the visible figures of the minuter parts; and by"|FALSE
15707|"habit we instantly recall the tangible figures."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when a tree is the object of sight, a part of the retina resembling a"|FALSE
15707|"flat branching figure is stimulated by various shades of colours; but it is"|FALSE
15707|"by suggestion, that the gibbosity of the tree, and the moss, that fringes"|FALSE
15707|"its trunk, appear before us. These are ideas of suggestion, which we feel"|FALSE
15707|"or attend to, associated with the motions of the retina, or irritative"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, which we do not attend to."|FALSE
15707|"So that though our visible ideas resemble in miniature the outline of the"|FALSE
15707|"figure of coloured bodies, in other respects they serve only as a language,"|FALSE
15707|"which by acquired associations introduce the tangible ideas of bodies."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it is, that this sense is so readily deceived by the art of the"|FALSE
15707|"painter to our amusement and instruction. The reader will find much very"|FALSE
15707|"curious knowledge on this subject in Bishop Berkley's Essay on Vision, a"|FALSE
15707|"work of great ingenuity."|FALSE
15707|"The immediate object however of the sense of vision is light; this fluid,"|FALSE
15707|"though its velocity is so great, appears to have no perceptible mechanical"|FALSE
15707|"impulse, as was mentioned in the third Section, but seems to stimulate the"|FALSE
15707|"retina into animal motion by its transmission through this part of the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorium: for though the eyes of cats or other animals appear luminous in"|FALSE
15707|"obscure places; yet it is probable, that none of the light, which falls on"|FALSE
15707|"the retina, is reflected from it, but adheres to or enters into combination"|FALSE
15707|"with the choroide coat behind it."|FALSE
15707|"The combination of the particles of light with opake bodies, and therefore"|FALSE
15707|"with the choroide coat of the eye, is evinced from the heat, which is given"|FALSE
15707|"out, as in other chemical combinations. For the sunbeams communicate no"|FALSE
15707|"heat in their passage through transparent bodies, with which they do not"|FALSE
15707|"combine, as the air continues cool even in the focus of the largest"|FALSE
15707|"burning-glasses, which in a moment vitrifies a particle of opaque matter."|FALSE
15707|"IV. _Of the Organ of Hearing._"|FALSE
15707|"It is generally believed, that the tympanum of the ear vibrates"|FALSE
15707|"mechanically, when exposed to audible sounds, like the strings of one"|FALSE
15707|"musical instrument, when the same notes are struck upon another. Nor is"|FALSE
15707|"this opinion improbable, as the muscles and cartilages of the larynx are"|FALSE
15707|"employed in producing variety of tones by mechanical vibration: so the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles and bones of the ear seem adapted to increase or diminish the"|FALSE
15707|"tension of the tympanum for the purposes of similar mechanical vibrations."|FALSE
15707|"But it appears from dissection, that the tympanum is not the immediate"|FALSE
15707|"organ of hearing, but that like the humours and cornea of the eye, it is"|FALSE
15707|"only of use to prepare the object for the immediate organ. For the portio"|FALSE
15707|"mollis of the auditory nerve is not spread upon the tympanum, but upon the"|FALSE
15707|"vestibulum, and cochlea, and semicircular canals of the ear; while between"|FALSE
15707|"the tympanum and the expansion of the auditory nerve the cavity is said by"|FALSE
15707|"Dr. Cotunnus and Dr. Meckel to be filled with water; as they had frequently"|FALSE
15707|"observed by freezing the heads of dead animals before they dissected them;"|FALSE
15707|"and water being a more dense fluid than air is much better adapted to the"|FALSE
15707|"propagation of vibrations. We may add, that even the external opening of"|FALSE
15707|"the ear is not absolutely necessary for the perception of sound: for some"|FALSE
15707|"people, who from these defects would have been completely deaf, have"|FALSE
15707|"distinguished acute or grave sounds by the tremours of a stick held between"|FALSE
15707|"their teeth propagated along the bones of the head, (Haller. Phys. T. V. p."|FALSE
15707|"295)."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, that the immediate organ of hearing is not affected by"|FALSE
15707|"the particles of the air themselves, but is stimulated into animal motion"|FALSE
15707|"by the vibrations of them. And it is probable from the loose bones, which"|FALSE
15707|"are found in the heads of some fishes, that the vibrations of water are"|FALSE
15707|"sensible to the inhabitants of that element by a similar organ."|FALSE
15707|"The motions of the atmosphere, which we become acquainted with by the sense"|FALSE
15707|"of touch, are combined with its solidity, weight, or vis intertiæ; whereas"|FALSE
15707|"those, that are perceived by this organ, depend alone on its elasticity."|FALSE
15707|"But though the vibration of the air is the immediate object of the sense of"|FALSE
15707|"hearing, yet the ideas, we receive by this sense, like those received from"|FALSE
15707|"light, are only as a language, which by acquired associations acquaints us"|FALSE
15707|"with those motions of tangible bodies, which depend on their elasticity;"|FALSE
15707|"and which we had before learned by our sense of touch."|FALSE
15707|"V. _Of Smell and of Taste._"|FALSE
15707|"The objects of smell are dissolved in the fluid atmosphere, and those of"|FALSE
15707|"taste in the saliva, or other aqueous fluid, for the better diffusing them"|FALSE
15707|"on their respective organs, which seem to be stimulated into animal motion"|FALSE
15707|"perhaps by the chemical affinities of these particles, which constitute the"|FALSE
15707|"sapidity and odorosity of bodies with the nerves of sense, which perceive"|FALSE
15707|"them."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. Volta has lately observed a curious circumstance relative to our sense"|FALSE
15707|"of taste. If a bit of clean lead and a bit of clean silver be separately"|FALSE
15707|"applied to the tongue and palate no taste is perceived; but by applying"|FALSE
15707|"them in contact in respect to the parts out of the mouth, and nearly so in"|FALSE
15707|"respect to the parts, which are immediately applied to the tongue and"|FALSE
15707|"palate, a saline or acidulous taste is perceived, as of a fluid like a"|FALSE
15707|"stream of electricity passing from one of them to the other. This new"|FALSE
15707|"application of the sense of taste deserves further investigation, as it may"|FALSE
15707|"acquaint us with new properties of matter."|FALSE
15707|"From the experiments above mentioned of Galvani, Volta, Fowler, and others,"|FALSE
15707|"it appears, that a plate of zinc and a plate of silver have greater effect"|FALSE
15707|"than lead and silver. If one edge of a plate of silver about the size of"|FALSE
15707|"half a crown-piece be placed upon the tongue, and one edge of a plate of"|FALSE
15707|"zinc about the same size beneath the tongue, and if their opposite edges"|FALSE
15707|"are then brought into contact before the point of the tongue, a taste is"|FALSE
15707|"perceived at the moment of their coming into contact; secondly, if one of"|FALSE
15707|"the above plates be put between the upper lip and the gum of the"|FALSE
15707|"fore-teeth, and the other be placed under the tongue, and their exterior"|FALSE
15707|"edges be then brought into contact in a darkish room, a flash of light is"|FALSE
15707|"perceived in the eyes."|FALSE
15707|"These effects I imagine only shew the sensibility of our nerves of sense to"|FALSE
15707|"very small quantities of the electric fluid, as it passes through them; for"|FALSE
15707|"I suppose these sensations are occasioned by slight electric shocks"|FALSE
15707|"produced in the following manner. By the experiments published by Mr."|FALSE
15707|"Bennet, with his ingenious doubler of electricity, which is the greatest"|FALSE
15707|"discovery made in that science since the coated jar, and the eduction of"|FALSE
15707|"lightning from the skies, it appears that zinc was always found minus, and"|FALSE
15707|"silver was always found plus, when both of them were in their separate"|FALSE
15707|"state. Hence, when they are placed in the manner above described, as soon"|FALSE
15707|"as their exterior edges come nearly into contact, so near as to have an"|FALSE
15707|"extremely thin plate of air between them, that plate of air becomes charged"|FALSE
15707|"in the same manner as a plate of coated glass; and is at the same instant"|FALSE
15707|"discharged through the nerves of taste or of sight, and gives the"|FALSE
15707|"sensations, as above described, of light or of saporocity; and only shews"|FALSE
15707|"the great sensibility of these organs of sense to the stimulus of the"|FALSE
15707|"electric fluid in suddenly passing through them."|FALSE
15707|"VI. _Of the Sense of Heat._"|FALSE
15707|"There are many experiments in chemical writers, that evince the existence"|FALSE
15707|"of heat as a fluid element, which covers and pervades all bodies, and is"|FALSE
15707|"attracted by the solutions of some of them, and is detruded from the"|FALSE
15707|"combination of others. Thus from the combinations of metals with acids, and"|FALSE
15707|"from those combinations of animal fluids, which are termed secretions, this"|FALSE
15707|"fluid matter of heat is given out amongst the neighbouring bodies; and in"|FALSE
15707|"the solutions of salts in water, or of water in air, it is absorbed from"|FALSE
15707|"the bodies, that surround them; whilst in its facility in passing through"|FALSE
15707|"metallic bodies, and its difficulty in pervading resins and glass, it"|FALSE
15707|"resembles the properties of the electric aura; and is like that excited by"|FALSE
15707|"friction, and seems like that to gravitate amongst other bodies in its"|FALSE
15707|"uncombined state, and to find its equilibrium."|FALSE
15707|"There is no circumstance of more consequence in the animal economy than a"|FALSE
15707|"due proportion of this fluid of heat; for the digestion of our nutriment in"|FALSE
15707|"the stomach and bowels, and the proper qualities of all our secreted"|FALSE
15707|"fluids, as they are produced or prepared partly by animal and partly by"|FALSE
15707|"chemical processes, depend much on the quantity of heat; the excess of"|FALSE
15707|"which, or its deficiency, alike gives us pain, and induces us to avoid the"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances that occasion them. And in this the perception of heat"|FALSE
15707|"essentially differs from the perceptions of the sense of touch, as we"|FALSE
15707|"receive pain from too great pressure of solid bodies, but none from the"|FALSE
15707|"absence of it. It is hence probable, that nature has provided us with a set"|FALSE
15707|"of nerves for the perception of this fluid, which anatomists have not yet"|FALSE
15707|"attended to."|FALSE
15707|"There may be some difficulty in the proof of this assertion; if we look at"|FALSE
15707|"a hot fire, we experience no pain of the optic nerve, though the heat along"|FALSE
15707|"with the light must be concentrated upon it. Nor does warm water or warm"|FALSE
15707|"oil poured into the ear give pain to the organ of hearing; and hence as"|FALSE
15707|"these organs of sense do not perceive small excesses or deficiences of"|FALSE
15707|"heat; and as heat has no greater analogy to the solidity or to the figures"|FALSE
15707|"of bodies, than it has to their colours or vibrations; there seems no"|FALSE
15707|"sufficient reason for our ascribing the perception of heat and cold to the"|FALSE
15707|"sense of touch; to which it has generally been attributed, either because"|FALSE
15707|"it is diffused beneath the whole skin like the sense of touch, or owing to"|FALSE
15707|"the inaccuracy of our observations, or the defect of our languages."|FALSE
15707|"There is another circumstance would induce us to believe, that the"|FALSE
15707|"perceptions of heat and cold do not belong to the organ of touch; since the"|FALSE
15707|"teeth, which are the least adapted for the perceptions of solidity or"|FALSE
15707|"figure, are the most sensible to heat or cold; whence we are forewarned"|FALSE
15707|"from swallowing those materials, whose degree of coldness or of heat would"|FALSE
15707|"injure our stomachs."|FALSE
15707|"The following is an extract from a letter of Dr. R.W. Darwin, of"|FALSE
15707|"Shrewsbury, when he was a student at Edinburgh. \"I made an experiment"|FALSE
15707|"yesterday in our hospital, which much favours your opinion, that the"|FALSE
15707|"sensation of heat and of touch depend on different sets of nerves. A man"|FALSE
15707|"who had lately recovered from a fever, and was still weak, was seized with"|FALSE
15707|"violent cramps in his legs and feet; which were removed by opiates, except"|FALSE
15707|"that one of his feet remained insensible. Mr. Ewart pricked him with a pin"|FALSE
15707|"in five or six places, and the patient declared he did not feel it in the"|FALSE
15707|"least, nor was he sensible of a very smart pinch. I then held a red-hot"|FALSE
15707|"poker at some distance, and brought it gradually nearer till it came within"|FALSE
15707|"three inches, when he asserted that he felt it quite distinctly. I suppose"|FALSE
15707|"some violent irritation on the nerves of touch had caused the cramps, and"|FALSE
15707|"had left them paralytic; while the nerves of heat, having suffered no"|FALSE
15707|"increased stimulus, retained their irritability.\""|FALSE
15707|"Add to this, that the lungs, though easily stimulated into inflammation,"|FALSE
15707|"are not sensible to heat. See Class. III. 1. 1. 10."|FALSE
15707|"VII. _Of the Sense of Extension._"|FALSE
15707|"The organ of touch is properly the sense of pressure, but the muscular"|FALSE
15707|"fibres themselves constitute the organ of sense, that feels extension. The"|FALSE
15707|"sense of pressure is always attended with the ideas of the figure and"|FALSE
15707|"solidity of the object, neither of which accompany our perception of"|FALSE
15707|"extension. The whole set of muscles, whether they are hollow ones, as the"|FALSE
15707|"heart, arteries, and intestines, or longitudinal ones attached to bones,"|FALSE
15707|"contract themselves, whenever they are stimulated by forcible elongation;"|FALSE
15707|"and it is observable, that the white muscles, which constitute the arterial"|FALSE
15707|"system, seem to be excited into contraction from no other kinds of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, according to the experiments of Haller. And hence the violent"|FALSE
15707|"pain in some inflammations, as in the paronychia, obtains immediate relief"|FALSE
15707|"by cutting the membrane, that was stretched by the tumour of the subjacent"|FALSE
15707|"parts."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the whole muscular system may be considered as one organ of sense,"|FALSE
15707|"and the various attitudes of the body, as ideas belonging to this organ, of"|FALSE
15707|"many of which we are hourly conscious, while many others, like the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas of the other senses, are performed without our attention."|FALSE
15707|"When the muscles of the heart cease to act, the refluent blood again"|FALSE
15707|"distends or elongates them; and thus irritated they contract as before. The"|FALSE
15707|"same happens to the arterial system, and I suppose to the capillaries,"|FALSE
15707|"intestines, and various glands of the body."|FALSE
15707|"When the quantity of urine, or of excrement, distends the bladder, or"|FALSE
15707|"rectum, those parts contract, and exclude their contents, and many other"|FALSE
15707|"muscles by association act along with them; but if these evacuations are"|FALSE
15707|"not soon complied with, pain is produced by a little further extension of"|FALSE
15707|"the muscular fibres: a similar pain is caused in the muscles, when a limb"|FALSE
15707|"is much extended for the reduction of dislocated bones; and in the"|FALSE
15707|"punishment of the rack: and in the painful cramps of the calf of the leg,"|FALSE
15707|"or of other muscles, for a greater degree of contraction of a muscle, than"|FALSE
15707|"the movement of the two bones, to which its ends are affixed, will admit"|FALSE
15707|"of, must give similar pain to that, which is produced by extending it"|FALSE
15707|"beyond its due length. And the pain from punctures or incisions arises from"|FALSE
15707|"the distention of the fibres, as the knife passes through them; for it"|FALSE
15707|"nearly ceases as soon as the division is completed."|FALSE
15707|"All these motions of the muscles, that are thus naturally excited by the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of distending bodies, are also liable to be called into strong"|FALSE
15707|"action by their catenation, with the irritations or sensations produced by"|FALSE
15707|"the momentum of the progressive particles of blood in the arteries, as in"|FALSE
15707|"inflammatory fevers, or by acrid substances on other sensible organs, as in"|FALSE
15707|"the strangury, or tenesmus, or cholera."|FALSE
15707|"We shall conclude this account of the sense of extension by observing, that"|FALSE
15707|"the want of its object is attended with a disagreeable sensation, as well"|FALSE
15707|"as the excess of it. In those hollow muscles, which have been accustomed to"|FALSE
15707|"it, this disagreeable sensation is called faintness, emptiness, and"|FALSE
15707|"sinking; and, when it arises to a certain degree, is attended with syncope,"|FALSE
15707|"or a total quiescence of all motions, but the internal irritative ones, as"|FALSE
15707|"happens from sudden loss of blood, or in the operation of tapping in the"|FALSE
15707|"dropsy."|FALSE
15707|"VIII. _Of the Appetites of Hunger, Thirst, Heat, Extension, the want of"|FALSE
15707|"fresh Air, animal Love, and the Suckling of Children._"|FALSE
15707|"Hunger is most probably perceived by those numerous ramifications of nerves"|FALSE
15707|"that are seen about the upper opening of the stomach; and thirst by the"|FALSE
15707|"nerves about the fauces, and the top of the gula. The ideas of these senses"|FALSE
15707|"are few in the generality of mankind, but are more numerous in those, who"|FALSE
15707|"by disease, or indulgence, desire particular kinds of foods or liquids."|FALSE
15707|"A sense of heat has already been spoken of, which may with propriety be"|FALSE
15707|"called an appetite, as we painfully desire it, when it is deficient in"|FALSE
15707|"quantity."|FALSE
15707|"The sense of extension may be ranked amongst these appetites, since the"|FALSE
15707|"deficiency of its object gives disagreeable sensation; when this happens in"|FALSE
15707|"the arterial system, it is called faintness, and seems to bear some analogy"|FALSE
15707|"to hunger and to cold; which like it are attended with emptiness of a part"|FALSE
15707|"of the vascular system."|FALSE
15707|"The sense of want of fresh air has not been attended to, but is as distinct"|FALSE
15707|"as the others, and the first perhaps that we experience after our nativity;"|FALSE
15707|"from the want of the object of this sense many diseases are produced, as"|FALSE
15707|"the jail-fever, plague, and other epidemic maladies. Animal love is another"|FALSE
15707|"appetite, which occurs later in life, and the females of lactiferous"|FALSE
15707|"animals have another natural inlet of pleasure or pain from the suckling"|FALSE
15707|"their offspring. The want of which either owing to the death of their"|FALSE
15707|"progeny, or to the fashion of their country, has been fatal to many of the"|FALSE
15707|"sex. The males have also pectoral glands, which are frequently turgid with"|FALSE
15707|"a thin milk at their nativity, and are furnished with nipples, which erect"|FALSE
15707|"on titillation like those of the female; but which seem now to be of no"|FALSE
15707|"further use, owing perhaps to some change which these animals have"|FALSE
15707|"undergone in the gradual progression of the formation of the earth, and of"|FALSE
15707|"all that it inhabit."|FALSE
15707|"These seven last mentioned senses may properly be termed appetites, as they"|FALSE
15707|"differ from those of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell, in this"|FALSE
15707|"respect; that they are affected with pain as well by the defect of their"|FALSE
15707|"objects as by the excess of them, which is not so in the latter. Thus cold"|FALSE
15707|"and hunger give us pain, as well as an excess of heat or satiety; but it is"|FALSE
15707|"not so with darkness and silence."|FALSE
15707|"IX. Before we conclude this Section on the organs of sense, we must"|FALSE
15707|"observe, that, as far as we know, there are many more senses, than have"|FALSE
15707|"been here mentioned, as every gland seems to be influenced to separate from"|FALSE
15707|"the blood, or to absorb from the cavities of the body, or from the"|FALSE
15707|"atmosphere, its appropriated fluid, by the stimulus of that fluid on the"|FALSE
15707|"living gland; and not by mechanical capillary absorption, nor by chemical"|FALSE
15707|"affinity. Hence it appears, that each of these glands must have a peculiar"|FALSE
15707|"organ to perceive these irritations, but as these irritations are not"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded by sensation, they have not acquired the names of senses."|FALSE
15707|"However when these glands are excited into motions stronger than usual,"|FALSE
15707|"either by the acrimony of their fluids, or by their own irritability being"|FALSE
15707|"much increased, then the sensation of pain is produced in them as in all"|FALSE
15707|"the other senses of the body; and these pains are all of different kinds,"|FALSE
15707|"and hence the glands at this time really become each a different organ of"|FALSE
15707|"sense, though these different kinds of pain have acquired no names."|FALSE
15707|"Thus a great excess of light does not give the idea of light but of pain;"|FALSE
15707|"as in forcibly opening the eye when it is much inflamed. The great excess"|FALSE
15707|"of pressure or distention, as when the point of a pin is pressed upon our"|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. As the constituent elements of the material world are only"|FALSE
15707|"perceptible to our organs of sense in a state of combination; it follows,"|FALSE
15707|"that the ideas or sensual motions excited by them, are never received"|FALSE
15707|"singly, but ever with a greater or less degree of combination. So the"|FALSE
15707|"colours of bodies or their hardnesses occur with their figures: every smell"|FALSE
15707|"and taste has its degree of pungency as well as its peculiar flavour: and"|FALSE
15707|"each note in music is combined with the tone of some instrument. It appears"|FALSE
15707|"from hence, that we can be sensible of a number of ideas at the same time,"|FALSE
15707|"such as the whiteness, hardness, and coldness, of a snow-ball, and can"|FALSE
15707|"experience at the same time many irritative ideas of surrounding bodies,"|FALSE
15707|"which we do not attend to, as mentioned in Section VII. 3. 2. But those"|FALSE
15707|"ideas which belong to the same sense, seem to be more easily combined into"|FALSE
15707|"synchronous tribes, than those which were not received by the same sense,"|FALSE
15707|"as we can more easily think of the whiteness and figure of a lump of sugar"|FALSE
15707|"at the same time, than the whiteness and sweetness of it."|FALSE
15707|"2. As these ideas, or sensual motions, are thus excited with greater or"|FALSE
15707|"less degrees of combination; so we have a power, when we repeat them either"|FALSE
15707|"by our volition or sensation, to increase or diminish this degree of"|FALSE
15707|"combination, that is, to form compounded ideas from those, which were more"|FALSE
15707|"simple; and abstract ones from those, which were more complex, when they"|FALSE
15707|"were first excited; that is, we can repeat a part or the whole of those"|FALSE
15707|"sensual motions, which did constitute our ideas of perception; and the"|FALSE
15707|"repetition of which now constitutes our ideas of recollection, or of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination."|FALSE
15707|"3. Those ideas, which we repeat without change of the quantity of that"|FALSE
15707|"combination, with which we first received them, are called complex ideas,"|FALSE
15707|"as when you recollect Westminster Abbey, or the planet Saturn: but it must"|FALSE
15707|"be observed, that these complex ideas, thus re-excited by volition,"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, or association, are seldom perfect copies of their correspondent"|FALSE
15707|"perceptions, except in our dreams, where other external objects do not"|FALSE
15707|"detract our attention."|FALSE
15707|"4. Those ideas, which are more complex than the natural objects that first"|FALSE
15707|"excited them, have been called compounded ideas, as when we think of a"|FALSE
15707|"sphinx, or griffin."|FALSE
15707|"5. And those that are less complex than the correspondent natural objects,"|FALSE
15707|"have been termed abstracted ideas: thus sweetness, and whiteness, and"|FALSE
15707|"solidity, are received at the same time from a lump of sugar, yet I can"|FALSE
15707|"recollect any of these qualities without thinking of the others, that were"|FALSE
15707|"excited along with them."|FALSE
15707|"When ideas are so far abstracted as in the above example, they have been"|FALSE
15707|"termed simple by the writers of metaphysics, and seem indeed to be more"|FALSE
15707|"complete repetitions of the ideas or sensual motions, originally excited by"|FALSE
15707|"external objects."|FALSE
15707|"Other classes of these ideas, where the abstraction has not been so great,"|FALSE
15707|"have been termed, by Mr. Locke, modes, substances, and relations, but they"|FALSE
15707|"seem only to differ in their degree of abstraction from the complex ideas"|FALSE
15707|"that were at first excited; for as these complex or natural ideas are"|FALSE
15707|"themselves imperfect copies of their correspondent perceptions, so these"|FALSE
15707|"abstract or general ideas are only still more imperfect copies of the same"|FALSE
15707|"perceptions. Thus when I have seen an object but once, as a rhinoceros, my"|FALSE
15707|"abstract idea of this animal is the same as my complex one. I may think"|FALSE
15707|"more or less distinctly of a rhinoceros, but it is the very rhinoceros that"|FALSE
15707|"I saw, or some part or property of him, which recurs to my mind."|FALSE
15707|"But when any class of complex objects becomes the subject of conversation,"|FALSE
15707|"of which I have seen many individuals, as a castle or an army, some"|FALSE
15707|"property or circumstance belonging to it is peculiarly alluded to; and then"|FALSE
15707|"I feel in my own mind, that my abstract idea of this complex object is only"|FALSE
15707|"an idea of that part, property, or attitude of it, that employs the present"|FALSE
15707|"conversation, and varies with every sentence that is spoken concerning it."|FALSE
15707|"So if any one should say, \"one may sit upon a horse safer than on a camel,\""|FALSE
15707|"my abstract idea of the two animals includes only an outline of the level"|FALSE
15707|"back of the one, and the gibbosity on the back of the other. What noise is"|FALSE
15707|"that in the street?--Some horses trotting over the pavement. Here my idea"|FALSE
15707|"of the horses includes principally the shape and motion of their legs. So"|FALSE
15707|"also the abstract ideas of goodness and courage are still more imperfect"|FALSE
15707|"representations of the objects they were received from; for here we"|FALSE
15707|"abstract the material parts, and recollect only the qualities."|FALSE
15707|"Thus we abstract so much from some of our complex ideas, that at length it"|FALSE
15707|"becomes difficult to determine of what perception they partake; and in many"|FALSE
15707|"instances our idea seems to be no other than of the sound or letters of the"|FALSE
15707|"word, that stands for the collective tribe, of which we are said to have an"|FALSE
15707|"abstracted idea, as noun, verb, chimæra, apparition."|FALSE
15707|"6. Ideas have been divided into those of perception and those of"|FALSE
15707|"reflection, but as whatever is perceived must be external to the organ that"|FALSE
15707|"perceives it, all our ideas must originally be ideas of perception."|FALSE
15707|"7. Others have divided our ideas into those of memory, and those of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination; they have said that a recollection of ideas in the order they"|FALSE
15707|"were received constitutes memory, and without that order imagination; but"|FALSE
15707|"all the ideas of imagination, excepting the few that are termed simple"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, are parts of trains or tribes in the order they were received; as if"|FALSE
15707|"I think of a sphinx, or a griffin, the fair face, bosom, wings, claws,"|FALSE
15707|"tail, are all complex ideas in the order they were received: and it behoves"|FALSE
15707|"the writers, who adhere to this definition, to determine, how small the"|FALSE
15707|"trains must be, that shall be called imagination; and how great those, that"|FALSE
15707|"shall be called memory."|FALSE
15707|"Others have thought that the ideas of memory have a greater vivacity than"|FALSE
15707|"those of imagination: but the ideas of a person in sleep, or in a waking"|FALSE
15707|"reverie, where the trains connected with sensation are uninterrupted, are"|FALSE
15707|"more vivid and distinct than those of memory, so that they cannot be"|FALSE
15707|"distinguished by this criterion."|FALSE
15707|"The very ingenious author of the Elements of Criticism has described what"|FALSE
15707|"he conceives to be a species of memory, and calls it ideal presence; but"|FALSE
15707|"the instances he produces are the reveries of sensation, and are therefore"|FALSE
15707|"in truth connections of the imagination, though they are recalled in the"|FALSE
15707|"order they were received."|FALSE
15707|"The ideas connected by association are in common discourse attributed to"|FALSE
15707|"memory, as we talk of memorandum-rings, and tie a knot on our handkerchiefs"|FALSE
15707|"to bring something into our minds at a distance of time. And a school-boy,"|FALSE
15707|"who can repeat a thousand unmeaning lines in Lilly's Grammar, is said to"|FALSE
15707|"have a good memory. But these have been already shewn to belong to the"|FALSE
15707|"class of association; and are termed ideas of suggestion."|FALSE
15707|"II. Lastly, the method already explained of classing ideas into those"|FALSE
15707|"excited by irritation, sensation, volition, or association, we hope will be"|FALSE
15707|"found more convenient both for explaining the operations of the mind, and"|FALSE
15707|"for comparing them with those of the body; and for the illustration and the"|FALSE
15707|"cure of the diseases of both, and which we shall here recapitulate."|FALSE
15707|"1. Irritative ideas are those, which are preceded by irritation, which is"|FALSE
15707|"excited by objects external to the organs of sense: as the idea of that"|FALSE
15707|"tree, which either I attend to, or which I shun in walking near it without"|FALSE
15707|"attention. In the former case it is termed perception, in the latter it is"|FALSE
15707|"termed simply an irritative idea."|FALSE
15707|"2. Sensitive ideas are those, which are preceded by the sensation of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure or pain; as the ideas, which constitute our dreams or reveries,"|FALSE
15707|"this is called imagination."|FALSE
15707|"3. Voluntary ideas are those, which are preceded by voluntary exertion, as"|FALSE
15707|"when I repeat the alphabet backwards: this is called recollection."|FALSE
15707|"4. Associate ideas are those, which are preceded by other ideas or muscular"|FALSE
15707|"motions, as when we think over or repeat the alphabet by rote in its usual"|FALSE
15707|"order; or sing a tune we are accustomed to; this is called suggestion."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Perceptions signify those ideas, which are preceded by irritation"|FALSE
15707|"and succeeded by the sensation of pleasure or pain, for whatever excites"|FALSE
15707|"our attention interests us; that is, it is accompanied with, pleasure or"|FALSE
15707|"pain; however slight may be the degree or quantity of either of them."|FALSE
15707|"The word memory includes two classes of ideas, either those which, are"|FALSE
15707|"preceded by voluntary exertion, or those which are suggested by their"|FALSE
15707|"associations with other ideas."|FALSE
15707|"2. Reasoning is that operation of the sensorium, by which we excite two or"|FALSE
15707|"many tribes of ideas; and then re-excite the ideas, in which they differ,"|FALSE
15707|"or correspond. If we determine this difference, it is called judgment; if"|FALSE
15707|"we in vain endeavour to determine it, it is called doubting."|FALSE
15707|"If we re-excited the ideas, in which they differ, it is called"|FALSE
15707|"distinguishing. If we re-excite those in which they correspond, it is"|FALSE
15707|"called comparing."|FALSE
15707|"3. Invention is an operation of the sensorium, by which we voluntarily"|FALSE
15707|"continue to excite one train of ideas, suppose the design of raising water"|FALSE
15707|"by a machine; and at the same time attend to all other ideas, which are"|FALSE
15707|"connected with this by every kind of catenation; and combine or separate"|FALSE
15707|"them voluntarily for the purpose of obtaining some end."|FALSE
15707|"For we can create nothing new, we can only combine or separate the ideas,"|FALSE
15707|"which we have already received by our perceptions: thus if I wish to"|FALSE
15707|"represent a monster, I call to my mind the ideas of every thing"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable and horrible, and combine the nastiness and gluttony of a hog,"|FALSE
15707|"the stupidity and obstinacy of an ass, with the fur and awkwardness of a"|FALSE
15707|"bear, and call the new combination Caliban. Yet such a monster may exist in"|FALSE
15707|"nature, as all his attributes are parts of nature. So when I wish to"|FALSE
15707|"represent every thing, that is excellent, and amiable; when I combine"|FALSE
15707|"benevolence with cheerfulness, wisdom, knowledge, taste, wit, beauty of"|FALSE
15707|"person, and elegance of manners, and associate them in one lady as a"|FALSE
15707|"pattern to the world, it is called invention; yet such a person may"|FALSE
15707|"exist,--such a person does exist!--It is ---- ----, who is as much a"|FALSE
15707|"monster as Caliban."|FALSE
15707|"4. In respect to consciousness, we are only conscious of our existence,"|FALSE
15707|"when we think about it; as we only perceive the lapse of time, when we"|FALSE
15707|"attend to it; when we are busied about other objects, neither the lapse of"|FALSE
15707|"time nor the consciousness of our own existence can occupy our attention."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, when we think of our own existence, we only excite abstracted or"|FALSE
15707|"reflex ideas (as they are termed), of our principal pleasures or pains, of"|FALSE
15707|"our desires or aversions, or of the figure, solidity, colour, or other"|FALSE
15707|"properties of our bodies, and call that act of the sensorium a"|FALSE
15707|"consciousness of our existence. Some philosopher, I believe it is Des"|FALSE
15707|"Cartes, has said, \"I think, therefore I exist.\" But this is not right"|FALSE
15707|"reasoning, because thinking is a mode of existence; and it is thence only"|FALSE
15707|"saying, \"I exist, therefore I exist.\" For there are three modes of"|FALSE
15707|"existence, or in the language of grammarians three kinds of verbs. First,"|FALSE
15707|"simply I am, or exist. Secondly, I am acting, or exist in a state of"|FALSE
15707|"activity, as I move. Thirdly, I am suffering, or exist in a state of being"|FALSE
15707|"acted upon, as I am moved. The when, and the where, as applicable to this"|FALSE
15707|"existence, depends on the successive motions of our own or of other bodies;"|FALSE
15707|"and on their respective situations, as spoken of Sect. XIV. 2. 5."|FALSE
15707|"5. Our identity is known by our acquired habits or catenated trains of"|FALSE
15707|"ideas and muscular motions; and perhaps, when we compare infancy with old"|FALSE
15707|"age, in those alone can our identity be supposed to exist. For what else is"|FALSE
15707|"there of similitude between the first speck of living entity and the mature"|FALSE
15707|"man?--every deduction of reasoning, every sentiment or passion, with every"|FALSE
15707|"fibre of the corporeal part of our system, has been subject almost to"|FALSE
15707|"annual mutation; while some catenations alone of our ideas and muscular"|FALSE
15707|"actions have continued in part unchanged."|FALSE
15707|"By the facility, with which we can in our waking hours voluntarily produce"|FALSE
15707|"certain successive trains of ideas, we know by experience, that we have"|FALSE
15707|"before reproduced them; that is, we are conscious of a time of our"|FALSE
15707|"existence previous to the present time; that is, of our identity now and"|FALSE
15707|"heretofore. It is these habits of action, these catenations of ideas and"|FALSE
15707|"muscular motions, which begin with life, and only terminate with it; and"|FALSE
15707|"which we can in some measure deliver to our posterity; as explained in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XXXIX."|FALSE
15707|"6. When the progressive motions of external bodies make a part of our"|FALSE
15707|"present catenation of ideas, we attend to the lapse of time; which appears"|FALSE
15707|"the longer, the more frequently we thus attend to it; as when we expect"|FALSE
15707|"something at a certain hour, which much interests us, whether it be an"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable or disagreeable event; or when we count the passing seconds on a"|FALSE
15707|"stop-watch."|FALSE
15707|"When an idea of our own person, or a reflex idea of our pleasures and"|FALSE
15707|"pains, desires and aversions, makes a part of this catenation, it is termed"|FALSE
15707|"consciousness; and if this idea of consciousness makes a part of a"|FALSE
15707|"catenation, which we excite by recollection, and know by the facility with"|FALSE
15707|"which we excite it, that we have before experienced it, it is called"|FALSE
15707|"identity, as explained above."|FALSE
15707|"7. In respect to freewill, it is certain, that we cannot will to think of a"|FALSE
15707|"new train of ideas, without previously thinking of the first link of it; as"|FALSE
15707|"I cannot will to think of a black swan, without previously thinking of a"|FALSE
15707|"black swan. But if I now think of a tail, I can voluntarily recollect all"|FALSE
15707|"animals, which have tails; my will is so far free, that I can pursue the"|FALSE
15707|"ideas linked to this idea of tail, as far as my knowledge of the subject"|FALSE
15707|"extends; but to will without motive is to will without desire or aversion;"|FALSE
15707|"which is as absurd as to feel without pleasure or pain; they are both"|FALSE
15707|"solecisms in the terms. So far are we governed by the catenations of"|FALSE
15707|"motions, which affect both the body and the mind of man, and which begin"|FALSE
15707|"with our irritability, and end with it."|FALSE

15707|"I. All those internal motions of animal bodies, which contribute to digest"|FALSE
15707|"their aliment, produce their secretions, repair their injuries, or increase"|FALSE
15707|"their growth, are performed without our attention or consciousness. They"|FALSE
15707|"exist as well in our sleep, as in our waking hours, as well in the foetus"|FALSE
15707|"during the time of gestation, as in the infant after nativity, and proceed"|FALSE
15707|"with equal regularity in the vegetable as in the animal system. These"|FALSE
15707|"motions have been shewn in a former part of this work to depend on the"|FALSE
15707|"irritations of peculiar fluids, and as they have never been classed amongst"|FALSE
15707|"the instinctive actions of animals, are precluded from our present"|FALSE
15707|"disquisition."|FALSE
15707|"But all those actions of men or animals, that are attended with"|FALSE
15707|"consciousness, and seem neither to have been directed by their appetites,"|FALSE
15707|"taught by their experience, nor deduced from observation or tradition, have"|FALSE
15707|"been referred to the power of instinct. And this power has been explained"|FALSE
15707|"to be a _divine something_, a kind of inspiration; whilst the poor animal,"|FALSE
15707|"that possesses it, has been thought little better than _a machine_!"|FALSE
15707|"The _irksomeness_, that attends a continued attitude of the body, or the"|FALSE
15707|"_pains_, that we receive from heat, cold, hunger, or other injurious"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances, excite us to _general locomotion_: and our senses are so"|FALSE
15707|"formed and constituted by the hand of nature, that certain objects present"|FALSE
15707|"us with pleasure, others with pain, and we are induced to approach and"|FALSE
15707|"embrace these, to avoid and abhor those, as such sensations direct us."|FALSE
15707|"Thus the palates of some animals are gratefully affected by the mastication"|FALSE

15707|"broken, that involve them, are seen to move themselves, to put out their"|FALSE
15707|"tongues, and to open and shut their mouths, (Harvey, Gipson, Riolan,"|FALSE
15707|"Haller). And calves lick themselves and swallow many of their hairs before"|FALSE
15707|"their nativity: which however puppies do not, (Swammerden, p. 319. Flemyng"|FALSE
15707|"Phil. Trans. Ann. 1755. 42). And towards the end of gestation, the foetus"|FALSE
15707|"of all animals are proved to drink part of the liquid in which they swim,"|FALSE
15707|"(Haller. Physiol. T. 8. 204). The white of egg is found in the mouth and"|FALSE
15707|"gizzard of the chick, and is nearly or quite consumed before it is hatched,"|FALSE
15707|"(Harvie de Generat. 58). And the liquor amnii is found in the mouth and"|FALSE
15707|"stomach of the human foetus, and of calves; and how else should that"|FALSE
15707|"excrement be produced in the intestines of all animals, which is voided in"|FALSE
15707|"great quantity soon after their birth; (Gipson, Med. Essays, Edinb. V. i."|FALSE
15707|"13. Halleri Physiolog. T. 3. p. 318. and T. 8). In the stomach of a calf"|FALSE
15707|"the quantity of this liquid amounted to about three pints, and the hairs"|FALSE
15707|"amongst it were of the same colour with those on its skin, (Blasii Anat."|FALSE
15707|"Animal, p.m. 122). These facts are attested by many other writers of"|FALSE
15707|"credit, besides those above mentioned."|FALSE
15707|"III. It has been deemed a surprising instance of instinct, that calves and"|FALSE
15707|"chickens should be able to walk by a few efforts almost immediately after"|FALSE
15707|"their nativity: whilst the human infant in those countries where he is not"|FALSE
15707|"incumbered with clothes, as in India, is five or six months, and in our"|FALSE
15707|"climate almost a twelvemonth, before he can safely stand upon his feet."|FALSE
15707|"The struggles of all animals in the womb must resemble their mode of"|FALSE
15707|"swimming, as by this kind of motion they can best change their attitude in"|FALSE
15707|"water. But the swimming of the calf and chicken resembles their manner of"|FALSE
15707|"walking, which they have thus in part acquired before their nativity, and"|FALSE
15707|"hence accomplish it afterwards with very few efforts, whilst the swimming"|FALSE
15707|"of the human creature resembles that of the frog, and totally differs from"|FALSE
15707|"his mode of walking."|FALSE
15707|"There is another circumstance to be attended to in this affair, that not"|FALSE
15707|"only the growth of those peculiar parts of animals, which are first wanted"|FALSE
15707|"to secure their subsistence, are in general furthest advanced before their"|FALSE
15707|"nativity: but some animals come into the world more completely formed"|FALSE
15707|"throughout their whole system than others: and are thence much forwarder in"|FALSE
15707|"all their habits of motion. Thus the colt, and the lamb, are much more"|FALSE
15707|"perfect animals than the blind puppy, and the naked rabbit; and the chick"|FALSE
15707|"of the pheasant, and the partridge, has more perfect plumage, and more"|FALSE
15707|"perfect eyes, as well as greater aptitude to locomotion, than the callow"|FALSE
15707|"nestlings of the dove, and of the wren. The parents of the former only find"|FALSE
15707|"it necessary to shew them their food, and to teach them to take it up;"|FALSE
15707|"whilst those of the latter are obliged for many days to obtrude it into"|FALSE
15707|"their gaping mouths."|FALSE
15707|"IV. From the facts mentioned in No. 2. of this Section, it is evinced that"|FALSE
15707|"the foetus learns to swallow before its nativity; for it is seen to open"|FALSE
15707|"its mouth, and its stomach is found filled with the liquid that surrounds"|FALSE
15707|"it. It opens its mouth, either instigated by hunger, or by the irksomeness"|FALSE
15707|"of a continued attitude of the muscles of its face; the liquor amnii, in"|FALSE
15707|"which it swims, is agreeable to its palate, as it consists of a nourishing"|FALSE
15707|"material, (Haller Phys. T. 8. p. 204). It is tempted to experience its"|FALSE
15707|"taste further in the mouth, and by a few efforts learns to swallow, in the"|FALSE
15707|"same manner as we learn all other animal actions, which are attended with"|FALSE
15707|"consciousness, _by the repeated efforts of our muscles under the conduct of"|FALSE
15707|"our sensations or volitions_."|FALSE
15707|"The inspiration of air into the lungs is so totally different from that of"|FALSE
15707|"swallowing a fluid in which we are immersed, that it cannot be acquired"|FALSE
15707|"before our nativity. But at this time, when the circulation of the blood is"|FALSE
15707|"no longer continued through the placenta, that suffocating sensation, which"|FALSE
15707|"we feel about the precordia, when we are in want of fresh air, disagreeably"|FALSE
15707|"affects the infant: and all the muscles of the body are excited into action"|FALSE
15707|"to relieve this oppression; those of the breast, ribs, and diaphragm are"|FALSE
15707|"found to answer this purpose, and thus respiration is discovered, and is"|FALSE
15707|"continued throughout our lives, as often as the oppression begins to recur."|FALSE
15707|"Many infants, both of the human creature, and of quadrupeds, struggle for a"|FALSE
15707|"minute after they are born before they begin to breathe, (Haller Phys. T."|FALSE
15707|"8. p. 400. ib pt. 2. p. 1). Mr. Buffon thinks the action of the dry air"|FALSE
15707|"upon the nerves of smell of new-born animals, by producing an endeavour to"|FALSE
15707|"sneeze, may contribute to induce this first inspiration, and that the"|FALSE
15707|"rarefaction of the air by the warmth of the lungs contributes to induce"|FALSE
15707|"expiration, (Hist. Nat. Tom. 4. p. 174). Which latter it may effect by"|FALSE
15707|"producing a disagreeable sensation by its delay, and a consequent effort to"|FALSE
15707|"relieve it. Many children sneeze before they respire, but not all, as far"|FALSE
15707|"as I have observed, or can learn from others."|FALSE
15707|"At length, by the direction of its sense of smell, or by the officious care"|FALSE
15707|"of its mother, the young animal approaches the odoriferous rill of its"|FALSE
15707|"future nourishment, already experienced to swallow. But in the act of"|FALSE
15707|"swallowing, it is necessary nearly to close the mouth, whether the creature"|FALSE
15707|"be immersed in the fluid it is about to drink, or not: hence, when the"|FALSE
15707|"child first attempts to suck, it does not slightly compress the nipple"|FALSE
15707|"between its lips, and suck as an adult person would do, by absorbing the"|FALSE
15707|"milk; but it takes the whole nipple into its mouth for this purpose,"|FALSE
15707|"compresses it between its gums, and thus repeatedly chewing (as it were)"|FALSE
15707|"the nipple, presses out the milk, exactly in the same manner as it is drawn"|FALSE
15707|"from the teats of cows by the hands of the milkmaid. The celebrated Harvey"|FALSE
15707|"observes, that the foetus in the womb must have sucked in a part of its"|FALSE
15707|"nourishment, because it knows how to suck the minute it is born, as any one"|FALSE
15707|"may experience by putting a finger between its lips, and because in a few"|FALSE
15707|"days it forgets this art of sucking, and cannot without some difficulty"|FALSE
15707|"again acquire it, (Exercit. de Gener. Anim. 48). The same observation is"|FALSE
15707|"made by Hippocrates."|FALSE
15707|"A little further experience teaches the young animal to suck by absorption,"|FALSE
15707|"as well as by compression; that is, to open the chest as in the beginning"|FALSE
15707|"of respiration, and thus to rarefy the air in the mouth, that the pressure"|FALSE
15707|"of the denser external atmosphere may contribute to force out the milk."|FALSE
15707|"The chick yet in the shell has learnt to drink by swallowing a part of the"|FALSE
15707|"white of the egg for its food; but not having experienced how to take up"|FALSE
15707|"and swallow solid seeds, or grains, is either taught by the felicitous"|FALSE
15707|"industry of its mother; or by many repeated attempts is enabled at length"|FALSE
15707|"to distinguish and to swallow this kind of nutriment."|FALSE
15707|"And puppies, though they know how to suck like other animals from their"|FALSE
15707|"previous experience in swallowing, and in respiration; yet are they long in"|FALSE
15707|"acquiring the art of lapping with their tongues, which from the flaccidity"|FALSE
15707|"of their cheeks, and length of their mouths, is afterwards a more"|FALSE
15707|"convenient way for them to take in water."|FALSE
15707|"V. The senses of smell and taste in many other animals greatly excel those"|FALSE
15707|"of mankind, for in civilized society, as our victuals are generally"|FALSE
15707|"prepared by others, and are adulterated with salt, spice, oil, and"|FALSE
15707|"empyreuma, we do not hesitate about eating whatever is set before us, and"|FALSE
15707|"neglect to cultivate these senses: whereas other animals try every morsel"|FALSE
15707|"by the smell, before they take it into their mouths, and by the taste"|FALSE
15707|"before they swallow it: and are led not only each to his proper nourishment"|FALSE
15707|"by this organ of sense, but it also at a maturer age directs them in the"|FALSE
15707|"gratification of their appetite of love. Which may be further understood by"|FALSE
15707|"considering the sympathies of these parts described in Class IV. 2. 1. 7."|FALSE
15707|"While the human animal is directed to the object of his love by his sense"|FALSE
15707|"of beauty, as mentioned in No. VI. of this Section. Thus Virgil. Georg."|FALSE

15707|"The following curious experiment is related by Galen. \"On dissecting a goat"|FALSE
15707|"great with young I found a brisk embryon, and having detached it from the"|FALSE
15707|"matrix, and snatching it away before it saw its dam, I brought it into a"|FALSE
15707|"certain room, where there were many vessels, some filled with wine, others"|FALSE
15707|"with oil, some with honey, others with milk, or some other liquor; and in"|FALSE
15707|"others were grains and fruits; we first observed the young animal get upon"|FALSE
15707|"its feet, and walk; then it shook itself, and afterwards scratched its side"|FALSE
15707|"with one of its feet: then we saw it smelling to every one of these things,"|FALSE
15707|"that were set in the room; and when it had smelt to them all, it drank up"|FALSE
15707|"the milk.\" L. 6. de locis. cap. 6."|FALSE
15707|"Parturient quadrupeds, as cats, and bitches, and sows, are led by their"|FALSE
15707|"sense of smell to eat the placenta as other common food; why then do they"|FALSE
15707|"not devour their whole progeny, as is represented in an antient emblem of"|FALSE
15707|"TIME? This is said sometimes to happen in the unnatural state in which we"|FALSE
15707|"confine sows; and indeed nature would seem to have endangered her offspring"|FALSE
15707|"in this nice circumstance! But at this time the stimulus of the milk in the"|FALSE
15707|"tumid teats of the mother excites her to look out for, and to desire some"|FALSE
15707|"unknown circumstance to relieve her. At the same time the smell of the milk"|FALSE
15707|"attracts the exertions of the young animals towards its source, and thus"|FALSE
15707|"the delighted mother discovers a new appetite, as mentioned in Sect. XIV."|FALSE
15707|"8. and her little progeny are led to receive and to communicate pleasure by"|FALSE
15707|"this most beautiful contrivance."|FALSE
15707|"VI. But though the human species in some of their sensations are much"|FALSE
15707|"inferior to other animals, yet the accuracy of the sense of touch, which"|FALSE
15707|"they possess in so eminent a degree, gives them a great superiority of"|FALSE
15707|"understanding; as is well observed by the ingenious Mr. Buffon. The"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of other animals terminate in horns, and hoofs, and claws, very"|FALSE
15707|"unfit for the sensation of touch; whilst the human hand is finely adapted"|FALSE
15707|"to encompass its object with this organ of sense."|FALSE
15707|"The elephant is indeed endued with a fine sense of feeling at the extremity"|FALSE
15707|"of his proboscis, and hence has acquired much more accurate ideas of touch"|FALSE
15707|"and of sight than most other creatures. The two following instances of the"|FALSE
15707|"sagacity of these animals may entertain the reader, as they were told me by"|FALSE
15707|"some gentlemen of distinct observation, and undoubted veracity, who had"|FALSE
15707|"been much conversant with our eastern settlements. First, the elephants"|FALSE
15707|"that are used to carry the baggage of our armies, are put each under the"|FALSE
15707|"care of one of the natives of Indostan, and whilst himself and his wife go"|FALSE
15707|"into the woods to collect leaves and branches of trees for his food, they"|FALSE
15707|"fix him to the ground by a length of chain, and frequently leave a child"|FALSE
15707|"yet unable to walk, under his protection: and the intelligent animal not"|FALSE
15707|"only defends it, but as it creeps about, when it arrives near the extremity"|FALSE
15707|"of his chain, he wraps his trunk gently round its body, and brings it again"|FALSE
15707|"into the centre of his circle. Secondly, the traitor elephants are taught"|FALSE
15707|"to walk on a narrow path between two pit-falls, which are covered with"|FALSE
15707|"turf, and then to go into the woods, and to seduce the wild elephants to"|FALSE
15707|"come that way, who fall into these wells, whilst he passes safe between"|FALSE
15707|"them: and it is universally observed, that those wild elephants that escape"|FALSE
15707|"the snare, pursue the traitor with the utmost vehemence, and if they can"|FALSE
15707|"overtake him, which sometimes happens, they always beat him to death."|FALSE
15707|"The monkey has a hand well enough adapted for the sense of touch, which"|FALSE
15707|"contributes to his great facility of imitation; but in taking objects with"|FALSE
15707|"his hands, as a stick or an apple, he puts his thumb on the same side of"|FALSE
15707|"them with his fingers, instead of counteracting the pressure of his fingers"|FALSE
15707|"with it: from this neglect he is much slower in acquiring the figures of"|FALSE
15707|"objects, as he is less able to determine the distances or diameters of"|FALSE
15707|"their parts, or to distinguish their vis inertiæ from their hardness."|FALSE
15707|"Helvetius adds, that the shortness of his life, his being fugitive before"|FALSE
15707|"mankind, and his not inhabiting all climates, combine to prevent his"|FALSE
15707|"improvement. (De l'Esprit. T. 1. p.) There is however at this time an old"|FALSE
15707|"monkey shewn in Exeter Change, London, who having lost his teeth, when nuts"|FALSE
15707|"are given him, takes a stone into his hand, and cracks them with it one by"|FALSE
15707|"one; thus using tools to effect his purpose like mankind."|FALSE
15707|"The beaver is another animal that makes much use of his hands, and if we"|FALSE
15707|"may credit the reports of travellers, is possessed of amazing ingenuity."|FALSE
15707|"This however, M. Buffon affirms, is only where they exist in large numbers,"|FALSE
15707|"and in countries thinly peopled with men; while in France in their solitary"|FALSE
15707|"state they shew no uncommon ingenuity."|FALSE
15707|"Indeed all the quadrupeds, that have collar-bones, (claviculæ) use their"|FALSE
15707|"fore-limbs in some measure as we use our hands, as the cat, squirrel,"|FALSE
15707|"tyger, bear and lion; and as they exercise the sense of touch more"|FALSE
15707|"universally than other animals, so are they more sagacious in watching and"|FALSE
15707|"surprising their prey. All those birds, that use their claws for hands, as"|FALSE
15707|"the hawk, parrot, and cuckoo, appear to be more docile and intelligent;"|FALSE
15707|"though the gregarious tribes of birds have more acquired knowledge."|FALSE
15707|"Now as the images, that are painted on the retina of the eye, are no other"|FALSE
15707|"than signs, which recall to our imaginations the objects we had before"|FALSE
15707|"examined by the organ of touch, as is fully demonstrated by Dr. Berkley in"|FALSE
15707|"his treatise on vision; it follows that the human creature has greatly more"|FALSE
15707|"accurate and distinct sense of vision than that of any other animal. Whence"|FALSE
15707|"as he advances to maturity he gradually acquires a sense of female beauty,"|FALSE
15707|"which at this time directs him to the object of his new passion."|FALSE
15707|"Sentimental love, as distinguished from the animal passion of that name,"|FALSE
15707|"with which it is frequently accompanied, consists in the desire or"|FALSE
15707|"sensation of beholding, embracing, and saluting a beautiful object."|FALSE
15707|"The characteristic of beauty therefore is that it is the object of love;"|FALSE
15707|"and though many other objects are in common language called beautiful, yet"|FALSE
15707|"they are only called so metaphorically, and ought to be termed agreeable. A"|FALSE
15707|"Grecian temple may give us the pleasurable idea of sublimity, a Gothic"|FALSE
15707|"temple may give us the pleasurable idea of variety, and a modern house the"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable idea of utility; music and poetry may inspire our love by"|FALSE
15707|"association of ideas; but none of these, except metaphorically, can be"|FALSE
15707|"termed beautiful; as we have no wish to embrace or salute them."|FALSE
15707|"Our perception of beauty consists in our recognition by the sense of vision"|FALSE
15707|"of those objects, first, which have before inspired our love by the"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure, which they have afforded to many of our senses: as to our sense"|FALSE
15707|"of warmth, of touch, of smell, of taste, hunger and thirst; and, secondly,"|FALSE
15707|"which bear any analogy of form to such objects."|FALSE
15707|"When the babe, soon after it is born into this cold world, is applied to"|FALSE
15707|"its mother's bosom; its sense of perceiving warmth is first agreeably"|FALSE
15707|"affected; next its sense of smell is delighted with the odour of her milk;"|FALSE
15707|"then its taste is gratified by the flavour of it: afterwards the appetites"|FALSE
15707|"of hunger and of thirst afford pleasure by the possession of their objects,"|FALSE
15707|"and by the subsequent digestion of the aliment; and, lastly, the sense of"|FALSE
15707|"touch is delighted by the softness and smoothness of the milky fountain,"|FALSE
15707|"the source of such variety of happiness."|FALSE
15707|"All these various kinds of pleasure at length become associated with the"|FALSE
15707|"form of the mother's breast; which the infant embraces with its hands,"|FALSE
15707|"presses with its lips, and watches with its eyes; and thus acquires more"|FALSE
15707|"accurate ideas of the form of its mother's bosom, than of the odour and"|FALSE
15707|"flavour or warmth, which it perceives by its other senses. And hence at our"|FALSE
15707|"maturer years, when any object of vision is presented to us, which by its"|FALSE
15707|"waving or spiral lines bears any similitude to the form of the female"|FALSE
15707|"bosom, whether it be found in a landscape with soft gradations of rising"|FALSE
15707|"and descending surface, or in the forms of some antique vases, or in other"|FALSE
15707|"works of the pencil or the chissel, we feel a general glow of delight,"|FALSE
15707|"which seems to influence all our senses; and, if the object be not too"|FALSE
15707|"large, we experience an attraction to embrace it with our arms, and to"|FALSE
15707|"salute it with our lips, as we did in our early infancy the bosom of our"|FALSE
15707|"mother. And thus we find, according to the ingenious idea of Hogarth, that"|FALSE
15707|"the waving lines of beauty were originally taken from the temple of Venus."|FALSE
15707|"This animal attraction is love; which is a sensation, when the object is"|FALSE
15707|"present; and a desire, when it is absent. Which constitutes the purest"|FALSE
15707|"source of human felicity, the cordial drop in the otherwise vapid cup of"|FALSE
15707|"life, and which overpays mankind for the care and labour, which are"|FALSE
15707|"attached to the pre-eminence of his situation above other animals."|FALSE
15707|"It should have been observed, that colour as well as form sometimes enters"|FALSE
15707|"into our idea of a beautiful object, as a good complexion for instance,"|FALSE
15707|"because a fine or fair colour is in general a sign of health, and conveys"|FALSE
15707|"to us an idea of the warmth of the object; and a pale countenance on the"|FALSE
15707|"contrary gives an idea of its being cold to the touch."|FALSE
15707|"It was before remarked, that young animals use their lips to distinguish"|FALSE
15707|"the forms of things, as well as their fingers, and hence we learn the"|FALSE
15707|"origin of our inclination to salute beautiful objects with our lips. For a"|FALSE
15707|"definition of Grace, see Class III. 1. 2. 4."|FALSE
15707|"VII. There are two ways by which we become acquainted with the passions of"|FALSE
15707|"others: first, by having observed the effects of them, as of fear or anger,"|FALSE
15707|"on our own bodies, we know at sight when others are under the influence of"|FALSE
15707|"these affections. So when two cocks are preparing to fight, each feels the"|FALSE
15707|"feathers rise round his own neck, and knows from the same sign the"|FALSE
15707|"disposition of his adversary: and children long before they can speak, or"|FALSE
15707|"understand the language of their parents, may be frightened by an angry"|FALSE
15707|"countenance, or soothed by smiles and blandishments."|FALSE
15707|"Secondly, when we put ourselves into the attitude that any passion"|FALSE
15707|"naturally occasions, we soon in some degree acquire that passion; hence"|FALSE
15707|"when those that scold indulge themselves in loud oaths, and violent actions"|FALSE
15707|"of the arms, they increase their anger by the mode of expressing"|FALSE
15707|"themselves: and on the contrary the counterfeited smile of pleasure in"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable company soon brings along with it a portion of the reality, as"|FALSE
15707|"is well illustrated by Mr. Burke. (Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful.)"|FALSE
15707|"This latter method of entering into the passions of others is rendered of"|FALSE
15707|"very extensive use by the pleasure we take in imitation, which is every day"|FALSE
15707|"presented before our eyes, in the actions of children, and indeed in all"|FALSE
15707|"the customs and fashions of the world. From this our aptitude to imitation,"|FALSE
15707|"arises what is generally understood by the word sympathy so well explained"|FALSE
15707|"by Dr. Smith of Glasgow. Thus the appearance of a cheerful countenance"|FALSE
15707|"gives us pleasure, and of a melancholy one makes us sorrowful. Yawning and"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes vomiting are thus propagated by sympathy, and some people of"|FALSE
15707|"delicate fibres, at the presence of a spectacle of misery, have felt pain"|FALSE
15707|"in the same parts of their own bodies, that were diseased or mangled in the"|FALSE
15707|"other. Amongst the writers of antiquity Aristotle thought this aptitude to"|FALSE
15707|"imitation an essential property of the human species, and calls man an"|FALSE
15707|"imitative animal. [Greek: To zôon mimômenon]."|FALSE
15707|"These then are the natural signs by which we understand each other, and on"|FALSE
15707|"this slender basis is built all human language. For without some natural"|FALSE
15707|"signs, no artificial ones could have been invented or understood, as is"|FALSE
15707|"very ingeniously observed by Dr. Reid. (Inquiry into the Human Mind.)"|FALSE
15707|"VIII. The origin of this universal language is a subject of the highest"|FALSE
15707|"curiosity, the knowledge of which has always been thought utterly"|FALSE
15707|"inaccessible. A part of which we shall however here attempt."|FALSE
15707|"Light, sound, and odours, are unknown to the foetus in the womb, which,"|FALSE
15707|"except the few sensations and motions already mentioned, sleeps away its"|FALSE
15707|"time insensible of the busy world. But the moment he arrives into day, he"|FALSE
15707|"begins to experience many vivid pains and pleasures; these are at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time attended with certain muscular motions, and from this their early, and"|FALSE
15707|"individual association, they acquire habits of occurring together, that are"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards indissoluble."|FALSE
15707|"1. _Of Fear._"|FALSE
15707|"As soon as the young animal is born, the first important sensations, that"|FALSE
15707|"occur to him, are occasioned by the oppression about his precordia for want"|FALSE
15707|"of respiration, and by his sudden transition from ninety-eight degrees of"|FALSE
15707|"heat into so cold a climate.--He trembles, that is, he exerts alternately"|FALSE
15707|"all the muscles of his body, to enfranchise himself from the oppression"|FALSE
15707|"about his bosom, and begins to breathe with frequent and short"|FALSE
15707|"respirations; at the same time the cold contracts his red skin, gradually"|FALSE
15707|"turning it pale; the contents of the bladder and of the bowels are"|FALSE
15707|"evacuated: and from the experience of these first disagreeable sensations"|FALSE
15707|"the passion of fear is excited, which is no other than the expectation of"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensations. This early association of motions and sensations"|FALSE
15707|"persists throughout life; the passion of fear produces a cold and pale"|FALSE
15707|"skin, with tremblings, quick respiration, and an evacuation of the bladder"|FALSE
15707|"and bowels, and thus constitutes the natural or universal language of this"|FALSE
15707|"passion."|FALSE
15707|"On observing a Canary bird this morning, January 28, 1772, at the house of"|FALSE
15707|"Mr. Harvey, near Tutbury, in Derbyshire, I was told it always fainted away,"|FALSE
15707|"when its cage was cleaned, and desired to see the experiment. The cage"|FALSE
15707|"being taken from the ceiling, and its bottom drawn out, the bird began to"|FALSE
15707|"tremble, and turned quite white about the root of his bill: he then opened"|FALSE
15707|"his mouth as if for breath, and respired quick, stood straighter up on his"|FALSE
15707|"perch, hung his wings, spread his tail, closed his eyes, and appeared quite"|FALSE
15707|"stiff and cataleptic for near half an hour, and at length with much"|FALSE
15707|"trembling and deep respirations came gradually to himself."|FALSE
15707|"2. _Of Grief._"|FALSE
15707|"That the internal membrane of the nostrils may be kept always moist, for"|FALSE
15707|"the better perception of odours, there are two canals, that conduct the"|FALSE
15707|"tears after they have done their office in moistening and cleaning the ball"|FALSE
15707|"of the eye into a sack, which is called the lacrymal sack; and from which"|FALSE
15707|"there is a duct, that opens into the nostrils: the aperture of this duct is"|FALSE
15707|"formed of exquisite sensibility, and when it is stimulated by odorous"|FALSE
15707|"particles, or by the dryness or coldness of the air, the sack contracts"|FALSE
15707|"itself, and pours more of its contained moisture on the organ of smell. By"|FALSE
15707|"this contrivance the organ is rendered more fit for perceiving such odours,"|FALSE
15707|"and is preserved from being injured by those that are more strong or"|FALSE
15707|"corrosive. Many other receptacles of peculiar fluids disgorge their"|FALSE
15707|"contents, when the ends of their ducts are stimulated; as the gall bladder,"|FALSE
15707|"when the contents of the duodenum stimulate the extremity of the common"|FALSE
15707|"bile duct: and the salivary glands, when the termination of their ducts in"|FALSE
15707|"the mouth are excited by the stimulus of the food we masticate. Atque"|FALSE
15707|"vesiculæ seminales suum exprimunt fluidum glande penis fricatâ."|FALSE
15707|"The coldness and dryness of the atmosphere, compared with the warmth and"|FALSE
15707|"moisture, which the new-born infant had just before experienced,"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeably affects the aperture of this lacrymal sack: the tears, that"|FALSE
15707|"are contained in this sack, are poured into the nostrils, and a further"|FALSE
15707|"supply is secreted by the lacrymal glands, and diffused upon the eye-balls;"|FALSE
15707|"as is very visible in the eyes and nostrils of children soon after their"|FALSE
15707|"nativity. The same happens to us at our maturer age, for in severe frosty"|FALSE
15707|"weather, snivelling and tears are produced by the coldness and dryness of"|FALSE
15707|"the air."|FALSE
15707|"But the lacrymal glands, which separate the tears from the blood, are"|FALSE
15707|"situated on the upper external part of the globes of each eye; and, when a"|FALSE
15707|"greater quantity of tears are wanted, we contract the forehead, and bring"|FALSE
15707|"down the eye-brows, and use many other distortions of the face, to compress"|FALSE
15707|"these glands."|FALSE
15707|"Now as the suffocating sensation, that produces respiration, is removed"|FALSE
15707|"almost as soon as perceived, and does not recur again: this disagreeable"|FALSE
15707|"irritation of the lacrymal ducts, as it must frequently recur, till the"|FALSE
15707|"tender organ becomes used to variety of odours, is one of the first pains"|FALSE
15707|"that is repeatedly attended to: and hence throughout our infancy, and in"|FALSE
15707|"many people throughout their lives, all disagreeable sensations are"|FALSE
15707|"attended with snivelling at the nose, a profusion of tears, and some"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar distortions of countenance: according to the laws of early"|FALSE

15707|"language of grief."|FALSE
15707|"You may assure yourself of the truth of this observation, if you will"|FALSE
15707|"attend to what passes, when you read a distressful tale alone; before the"|FALSE
15707|"tears overflow your eyes, you will invariably feel a titillation at that"|FALSE
15707|"extremity of the lacrymal duct, which terminates in the nostril, then the"|FALSE
15707|"compression of the eyes succeeds, and the profusion of tears."|FALSE
15707|"Linnæus asserts, that the female bear sheds tears in grief; the same has"|FALSE
15707|"been said of the hind, and some other animals."|FALSE
15707|"3. _Of Tender Pleasure._"|FALSE
15707|"The first most lively impression of pleasure, that the infant enjoys after"|FALSE
15707|"its nativity, is excited by the odour of its mother's milk. The organ of"|FALSE
15707|"smell is irritated by this perfume, and the lacrymal sack empties itself"|FALSE
15707|"into the nostrils, as before explained, and an increase of tears is poured"|FALSE
15707|"into the eyes. Any one may observe this, when very young infants are about"|FALSE
15707|"to suck; for at those early periods of life, the sensation affects the"|FALSE
15707|"organ of smell, much more powerfully, than after the repeated habits of"|FALSE
15707|"smelling has inured it to odours of common strength: and in our adult"|FALSE
15707|"years, the stronger smells, though they are at the same time agreeable to"|FALSE
15707|"us, as of volatile spirits, continue to produce an increased secretion of"|FALSE
15707|"tears."|FALSE
15707|"This pleasing sensation of smell is followed by the early affection of the"|FALSE
15707|"infant to the mother that suckles it, and hence the tender feelings of"|FALSE
15707|"gratitude and love, as well as of hopeless grief, are ever after joined"|FALSE
15707|"with the titillation of the extremity of the lacrymal ducts, and a"|FALSE
15707|"profusion of tears."|FALSE
15707|"Nor is it singular, that the lacrymal sack should be influenced by pleasing"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, as the sight of agreeable food produces the same effect on the"|FALSE
15707|"salivary glands. Ac dum vidimus insomniis lascivæ puellæ simulacrum"|FALSE
15707|"tenditur penis."|FALSE
15707|"Lambs shake or wriggle their tails, at the time when they first suck, to"|FALSE
15707|"get free of the hard excrement, which had been long lodged in their bowels."|FALSE
15707|"Hence this becomes afterwards a mark of pleasure in them, and in dogs, and"|FALSE
15707|"other tailed animals. But cats gently extend and contract their paws when"|FALSE
15707|"they are pleased, and purr by drawing in their breath, both which resemble"|FALSE
15707|"their manner of sucking, and thus become their language of pleasure, for"|FALSE
15707|"these animals having collar-bones use their paws like hands when they suck,"|FALSE
15707|"which dogs and sheep do not."|FALSE
15707|"4. _Of Serene Pleasure._"|FALSE
15707|"In the action of sucking, the lips of the infant are closed around the"|FALSE
15707|"nipple of its mother, till he has filled his stomach, and the pleasure"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned by the stimulus of this grateful food succeeds. Then the"|FALSE
15707|"sphincter of the mouth, fatigued by the continued action of sucking, is"|FALSE
15707|"relaxed; and the antagonist muscles of the face gently acting, produce the"|FALSE
15707|"smile of pleasure: as cannot but be seen by all who are conversant with"|FALSE
15707|"children."|FALSE
15707|"Hence this smile during our lives is associated with gentle pleasure; it is"|FALSE
15707|"visible in kittens, and puppies, when they are played with, and tickled;"|FALSE
15707|"but more particularly marks the human features. For in children this"|FALSE
15707|"expression of pleasure is much encouraged, by their imitation of their"|FALSE
15707|"parents, or friends; who generally address them with a smiling countenance:"|FALSE
15707|"and hence some nations are more remarkable for the gaiety, and others for"|FALSE
15707|"the gravity of their looks."|FALSE
15707|"5. _Of Anger._"|FALSE
15707|"The actions that constitute the mode of fighting, are the immediate"|FALSE
15707|"language of anger in all animals; and a preparation for these actions is"|FALSE
15707|"the natural language of threatening. Hence the human creature clenches his"|FALSE
15707|"fist, and sternly surveys his adversary, as if meditating where to make the"|FALSE
15707|"attack; the ram, and the bull, draws himself some steps backwards, and"|FALSE
15707|"levels his horns; and the horse, as he most frequently fights by striking"|FALSE
15707|"with his hinder feet, turns his heels to his foe, and bends back his ears,"|FALSE
15707|"to listen out the place of his adversary, that the threatened blow may not"|FALSE
15707|"be ineffectual."|FALSE
15707|"6. _Of Attention._"|FALSE
15707|"The eye takes in at once but half our horizon, and that only in the day,"|FALSE
15707|"and our smell informs us of no very distant objects, hence we confide"|FALSE
15707|"principally in the organ of hearing to apprize us of danger: when we hear"|FALSE
15707|"any the smallest sound, that we cannot immediately account for, our fears"|FALSE
15707|"are alarmed, we suspend our steps, hold every muscle still, open our mouths"|FALSE
15707|"a little, erect our ears, and listen to gain further information: and this"|FALSE
15707|"by habit becomes the general language of attention to objects of sight, as"|FALSE
15707|"well as of hearing; and even to the successive trains of our ideas."|FALSE
15707|"The natural language of violent pain, which is expressed by writhing the"|FALSE
15707|"body, grinning, and screaming; and that of tumultuous pleasure, expressed"|FALSE
15707|"in loud laughter; belong to Section XXXIV. on Diseases from Volition."|FALSE
15707|"IX. It must have already appeared to the reader, that all other animals, as"|FALSE
15707|"well as man, are possessed of this natural language of the passions,"|FALSE
15707|"expressed in signs or tones; and we shall endeavour to evince, that those"|FALSE
15707|"animals, which have preserved themselves from being enslaved by mankind,"|FALSE
15707|"and are associated in flocks, are also possessed of some artificial"|FALSE
15707|"language, and of some traditional knowledge."|FALSE
15707|"The mother-turkey, when she eyes a kite hovering high in air, has either"|FALSE
15707|"seen her own parents thrown into fear at his presence, or has by"|FALSE
15707|"observation been acquainted with his dangerous designs upon her young. She"|FALSE
15707|"becomes agitated with fear, and uses the natural language of that passion,"|FALSE
15707|"her young ones catch the fear by imitation, and in an instant conceal"|FALSE
15707|"themselves in the grass."|FALSE
15707|"At the same time that she shews her fears by her gesture and deportment,"|FALSE
15707|"she uses a certain exclamation, Koe-ut, Koe-ut, and the young ones"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards know, when they hear this note, though they do not see their"|FALSE
15707|"dam, that the presence of their adversary is denounced, and hide themselves"|FALSE
15707|"as before."|FALSE
15707|"The wild tribes of birds have very frequent opportunities of knowing their"|FALSE
15707|"enemies, by observing the destruction they make among their progeny, of"|FALSE
15707|"which every year but a small part escapes to maturity: but to our domestic"|FALSE
15707|"birds these opportunities so rarely occur, that their knowledge of their"|FALSE
15707|"distant enemies must frequently be delivered by tradition in the manner"|FALSE
15707|"above explained, through many generations."|FALSE
15707|"This note of danger, as well as the other notes of the mother-turkey, when"|FALSE
15707|"she calls her flock to their food, or to sleep under her wings, appears to"|FALSE
15707|"be an artificial language, both as expressed by the mother, and as"|FALSE
15707|"understood by the progeny. For a hen teaches this language with equal ease"|FALSE
15707|"to the ducklings, she has hatched from suppositious eggs, and educates as"|FALSE
15707|"her own offspring: and the wagtails, or hedge-sparrows, learn it from the"|FALSE
15707|"young cuckoo their softer nursling, and supply him with food long after he"|FALSE
15707|"can fly about, whenever they hear his cuckooing, which Linnæus tells us, is"|FALSE
15707|"his call of hunger, (Syst. Nat.) And all our domestic animals are readily"|FALSE
15707|"taught to come to us for food, when we use one tone of voice, and to fly"|FALSE
15707|"from our anger, when we use another."|FALSE
15707|"Rabbits, as they cannot easily articulate sounds, and are formed into"|FALSE
15707|"societies, that live under ground, have a very different method of giving"|FALSE
15707|"alarm. When danger is threatened, they thump on the ground with one of"|FALSE
15707|"their hinder feet, and produce a sound, that can be heard a great way by"|FALSE
15707|"animals near the surface of the earth, which would seem to be an artificial"|FALSE
15707|"sign both from its singularity and its aptness to the situation of the"|FALSE
15707|"animal."|FALSE
15707|"The rabbits on the island of Sor, near Senegal, have white flesh, and are"|FALSE
15707|"well tasted, but do not burrow in the earth, so that we may suspect their"|FALSE
15707|"digging themselves houses in this cold climate is an acquired art, as well"|FALSE
15707|"as their note of alarm, (Adanson's Voyage to Senegal)."|FALSE
15707|"The barking of dogs is another curious note of alarm, and would seem to be"|FALSE
15707|"an acquired language, rather than a natural sign: for \"in the island of"|FALSE
15707|"Juan Fernandes, the dogs did not attempt to bark, till some European dogs"|FALSE
15707|"were put among them, and then they gradually begun to imitate them, but in"|FALSE
15707|"a strange manner at first, as if they were learning a thing that was not"|FALSE
15707|"natural to them,\" (Voyage to South America by Don G. Juan, and Don Ant. de"|FALSE
15707|"Ulloa. B. 2. c. 4)."|FALSE
15707|"Linnæus also observes, that the dogs of South America do not bark at"|FALSE
15707|"strangers, (Syst. Nat.) And the European dogs, that have been carried to"|FALSE
15707|"Guinea, are said in three or four generations to cease to bark, and only"|FALSE
15707|"howl, like the dogs that are natives of that coast, (World Displayed, Vol."|FALSE
15707|"XVII. p. 26.)"|FALSE
15707|"A circumstance not dissimilar to this, and equally curious, is mentioned by"|FALSE
15707|"Kircherus, de Musurgia, in his Chapter de Lusciniis, \"That the young"|FALSE
15707|"nightingales, that are hatched under other birds, never sing till they are"|FALSE
15707|"instructed by the company of other nightingales.\" And Jonston affirms, that"|FALSE
15707|"the nightingales that visit Scotland, have not the same harmony as those of"|FALSE
15707|"Italy, (Pennant's Zoology, octavo, p. 255); which would lead us to suspect"|FALSE
15707|"that the singing of birds, like human music, is an artificial language"|FALSE
15707|"rather than a natural expression of passion."|FALSE
15707|"X. Our music like our language, is perhaps entirely constituted of"|FALSE
15707|"artificial tones, which by habit suggest certain agreeable passions. For"|FALSE
15707|"the same combination of notes and tones do not excite devotion, love, or"|FALSE
15707|"poetic melancholy in a native of Indostan and of Europe. And \"the"|FALSE
15707|"Highlander has the same warlike ideas annexed to the sound of a bagpipe (an"|FALSE
15707|"instrument which an Englishman derides), as the Englishman has to that of a"|FALSE
15707|"trumpet or fife,\" (Dr. Brown's Union of Poetry and Music, p. 58.) So \"the"|FALSE
15707|"music of the Turks is very different from the Italian, and the people of"|FALSE
15707|"Fez and Morocco have again a different kind, which to us appears very rough"|FALSE
15707|"and horrid, but is highly pleasing to them,\" (L'Arte Armoniaca a Giorgio"|FALSE
15707|"Antoniotto). Hence we see why the Italian opera does not delight an"|FALSE
15707|"untutored Englishman; and why those, who are unaccustomed to music, are"|FALSE
15707|"more pleased with a tune, the second or third time they hear it, than the"|FALSE
15707|"first. For then the same melodious train of sounds excites the melancholy,"|FALSE
15707|"they had learned from the song; or the same vivid combination of them"|FALSE
15707|"recalls all the mirthful ideas of the dance and company."|FALSE
15707|"Even the sounds, that were once disagreeable to us, may by habit be"|FALSE
15707|"associated with other ideas, so as to become agreeable. Father Lasitau, in"|FALSE
15707|"his account of the Iroquois, says \"the music and dance of those Americans,"|FALSE
15707|"have something in them extremely barbarous, which at first disgusts. We"|FALSE
15707|"grow reconciled to them by degrees, and in the end partake of them with"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure, the savages themselves are fond of them to distraction,\" (Moeurs"|FALSE
15707|"des Savages, Tom. ii.)"|FALSE
15707|"There are indeed a few sounds, that we very generally associate with"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable ideas, as the whistling of birds, or purring of animals, that are"|FALSE
15707|"delighted; and some others, that we as generally associate with"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable ideas, as the cries of animals in pain, the hiss of some of"|FALSE
15707|"them in anger, and the midnight howl of beasts of prey. Yet we receive no"|FALSE
15707|"terrible or sublime ideas from the lowing of a cow, or the braying of an"|FALSE
15707|"ass. Which evinces, that these emotions are owing to previous associations."|FALSE
15707|"So if the rumbling of a carriage in the street be for a moment mistaken for"|FALSE
15707|"thunder, we receive a sublime sensation, which ceases as soon as we know it"|FALSE
15707|"is the noise of a coach and six."|FALSE
15707|"There are other disagreeable sounds, that are said to set the teeth on"|FALSE
15707|"edge; which, as they have always been thought a necessary effect of certain"|FALSE
15707|"discordant notes, become a proper subject of our enquiry. Every one in his"|FALSE
15707|"childhood has repeatedly bit a part of the glass or earthen vessel, in"|FALSE
15707|"which his food has been given him, and has thence had a very disagreeable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation in the teeth, which sensation was designed by nature to prevent"|FALSE
15707|"us from exerting them on objects harder than themselves. The jarring sound"|FALSE
15707|"produced between the cup and the teeth is always attendant on this"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation: and ever after when such a sound is accidentally"|FALSE
15707|"produced by the conflict of two hard bodies, we feel by association of"|FALSE
15707|"ideas the concomitant disagreeable sensation in our teeth."|FALSE
15707|"Others have in their infancy frequently held the corner of a silk"|FALSE
15707|"handkerchief in their mouth, or the end of the velvet cape of their coat,"|FALSE
15707|"whilst their companions in play have plucked it from them, and have given"|FALSE
15707|"another disagreeable sensation to their teeth, which has afterwards"|FALSE
15707|"recurred on touching those materials. And the sight of a knife drawn along"|FALSE
15707|"a china plate, though no sound is excited by it, and even the imagination"|FALSE
15707|"of such a knife and plate so scraped together, I know by repeated"|FALSE
15707|"experience will produce the same disagreeable sensation of the teeth."|FALSE
15707|"These circumstances indisputably prove, that this sensation of the"|FALSE
15707|"tooth-edge is owing to associated ideas; as it is equally excitable by"|FALSE
15707|"sight, touch, hearing, or imagination."|FALSE
15707|"In respect to the artificial proportions of sound excited by musical"|FALSE
15707|"instruments, those, who have early in life associated them with agreeable"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, and have nicely attended to distinguish them from each other, are"|FALSE
15707|"said to have a good ear, in that country where such proportions are in"|FALSE
15707|"fashion: and not from any superior perfection in the organ of hearing, or"|FALSE
15707|"any intuitive sympathy between certain sounds and passions."|FALSE
15707|"I have observed a child to be exquisitely delighted with music, and who"|FALSE
15707|"could with great facility learn to sing any tune that he heard distinctly,"|FALSE
15707|"and yet whole organ of hearing was so imperfect, that it was necessary to"|FALSE
15707|"speak louder to him in common conversation than to others."|FALSE
15707|"Our music, like our architecture, seems to have no foundation in nature,"|FALSE
15707|"they are both arts purely of human creation, as they imitate nothing. And"|FALSE
15707|"the professors of them have only classed those circumstances, that are most"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable to the accidental taste of their age, or country; and have called"|FALSE
15707|"it Proportion. But this proportion must always fluctuate, as it rests on"|FALSE
15707|"the caprices, that are introduced into our minds by our various modes of"|FALSE
15707|"education. And these fluctuations of taste must become more frequent in the"|FALSE
15707|"present age, where mankind have enfranchised themselves from the blind"|FALSE
15707|"obedience to the rules of antiquity in perhaps every science, but that of"|FALSE
15707|"architecture. See Sect. XII. 7. 3."|FALSE
15707|"XI. There are many articles of knowledge, which the animals in cultivated"|FALSE
15707|"countries seem to learn very early in their lives, either from each other,"|FALSE
15707|"or from experience, or observation: one of the most general of these is to"|FALSE
15707|"avoid mankind. There is so great a resemblance in the natural language of"|FALSE
15707|"the passions of all animals, that we generally know, when they are in a"|FALSE
15707|"pacific, or in a malevolent humour, they have the same knowledge of us; and"|FALSE
15707|"hence we can scold them from us by some tones and gestures, and could"|FALSE
15707|"possibly attract them to us by others, if they were not already apprized of"|FALSE
15707|"our general malevolence towards them. Mr. Gmelin, Professor at Petersburg,"|FALSE
15707|"assures us, that in his journey into Siberia, undertaken by order of the"|FALSE
15707|"Empress of Russia, he saw foxes, that expressed no fear of himself or"|FALSE
15707|"companions, but permitted him to come quite near them, having never seen"|FALSE
15707|"the human creature before. And Mr. Bongainville relates, that at his"|FALSE
15707|"arrival at the Malouine, or Falkland's Islands, which were not inhabited by"|FALSE
15707|"men, all the animals came about himself and his people; the fowls settling"|FALSE
15707|"upon their heads and shoulders, and the quadrupeds running about their"|FALSE
15707|"feet. From the difficulty of acquiring the confidence of old animals, and"|FALSE
15707|"the ease of taming young ones, it appears that the fear, they all conceive"|FALSE
15707|"at the sight of mankind, is an acquired article of knowledge."|FALSE
15707|"This knowledge is more nicely understood by rooks, who are formed into"|FALSE
15707|"societies, and build, as it were, cities over our heads; they evidently"|FALSE
15707|"distinguish, that the danger is greater when a man is armed with a gun."|FALSE
15707|"Every one has seen this, who in the spring of the year has walked under a"|FALSE
15707|"rookery with a gun in his hand: the inhabitants of the trees rise on their"|FALSE
15707|"wings, and scream to the unfledged young to shrink into their nests from"|FALSE
15707|"the sight of the enemy. The vulgar observing this circumstance so uniformly"|FALSE
15707|"to occur, assert that rooks can smell gun-powder."|FALSE
15707|"The fieldfares, (turdus pilarus) which breed in Norway, and come hither in"|FALSE
15707|"the cold season for our winter berries; as they are associated in flocks,"|FALSE
15707|"and are in a foreign country, have evident marks of keeping a kind of"|FALSE
15707|"watch, to remark and announce the appearance of danger. On approaching a"|FALSE
15707|"tree, that is covered with them, they continue fearless till one at the"|FALSE
15707|"extremity of the bush rising on his wings gives a loud and peculiar note of"|FALSE
15707|"alarm, when they all immediately fly, except one other, who continues till"|FALSE
15707|"you approach still nearer, to certify as it were the reality of the danger,"|FALSE
15707|"and then he also flies off repeating the note of alarm."|FALSE
15707|"And in the woods about Senegal there is a bird called uett-uett by the"|FALSE
15707|"negroes, and squallers by the French, which, as soon as they see a man, set"|FALSE
15707|"up a loud scream, and keep flying round him, as if their intent was to warn"|FALSE
15707|"other birds, which upon hearing the cry immediately take wing. These birds"|FALSE
15707|"are the bane of sportsmen, and frequently put me into a passion, and"|FALSE
15707|"obliged me to shoot them, (Adanson's Voyage to Senegal, 78). For the same"|FALSE
15707|"intent the lesser birds of our climate seem to fly after a hawk, cuckoo, or"|FALSE
15707|"owl, and scream to prevent their companions from being surprised by the"|FALSE
15707|"general enemies of themselves, or of their eggs and progeny."|FALSE
15707|"But the lapwing, (charadrius pluvialis Lin.) when her unfledged offspring"|FALSE
15707|"run about the marshes, where they were hatched, not only gives the note of"|FALSE

15707|"XII. The knowledge and language of those birds, that frequently change"|FALSE

15707|"emigrations were at first undertaken as accident directed, by the more"|FALSE
15707|"adventurous of their species, and learned from one another like the"|FALSE
15707|"discoveries of mankind in navigation. The following circumstances strongly"|FALSE
15707|"support this opinion."|FALSE
15707|"1. Nature has provided these animals, in the climates where they are"|FALSE
15707|"produced, with another resource: when the season becomes too cold for their"|FALSE
15707|"constitutions, or the food they were supported with ceases to be supplied,"|FALSE
15707|"I mean that of sleeping. Dormice, snakes, and bats, have not the means of"|FALSE
15707|"changing their country; the two former from the want of wings, and the"|FALSE
15707|"latter from his being not able to bear the light of the day. Hence these"|FALSE
15707|"animals are obliged to make use of this resource, and sleep during the"|FALSE
15707|"winter. And those swallows that have been hatched too late in the year to"|FALSE
15707|"acquire their full strength of pinion, or that have been maimed by accident"|FALSE
15707|"or disease, have been frequently found in the hollows of rocks on the sea"|FALSE
15707|"coasts, and even under water in this torpid state, from which they have"|FALSE
15707|"been revived by the warmth of a fire. This torpid state of swallows is"|FALSE
15707|"testified by innumerable evidences both of antient and modern names."|FALSE
15707|"Aristotle speaking of the swallows says, \"They pass into warmer climates in"|FALSE
15707|"winter, if such places are at no great distance; if they are, they bury"|FALSE

15707|"Derham's Phys. Theol. v. ii. p. 177.)"|FALSE
15707|"Hence their emigrations cannot depend on a _necessary_ instinct, as the"|FALSE
15707|"emigrations themselves are not _necessary_."|FALSE
15707|"2. When the weather becomes cold, the swallows in the neighbourhood"|FALSE
15707|"assemble in large flocks; that is, the unexperienced attend those that have"|FALSE
15707|"before experienced the journey they are about to undertake: they are then"|FALSE
15707|"seen some time to hover on the coast, till there is calm whether, or a"|FALSE
15707|"wind, that suits the direction of their flight. Other birds of passage have"|FALSE
15707|"been drowned by thousands in the sea, or have settled on ships quite"|FALSE
15707|"exhausted with fatigue. And others, either by mistaking their course, or by"|FALSE
15707|"distress of weather, have arrived in countries where they were never seen"|FALSE
15707|"before: and thus are evidently subject to the same hazards that the human"|FALSE
15707|"species undergo, in the execution of their artificial purposes."|FALSE
15707|"3. The same birds are emigrant from some countries and not so from others:"|FALSE
15707|"the swallows were seen at Goree in January by an ingenious philosopher of"|FALSE
15707|"my acquaintance, and he was told that they continued there all the year; as"|FALSE
15707|"the warmth of the climate was at all seasons sufficient for their own"|FALSE
15707|"constitutions, and for the production of the flies that supply them with"|FALSE
15707|"nourishment. Herodotus says, that in Libya, about the springs of the Nile,"|FALSE

15707|"When my late friend Dr. Chambres, of Derby, was on the island of Caprea in"|FALSE

15707|"Linnæus has observed, that in Sweden the female chaffinches quit that"|FALSE

15707|"kind of food from it."|FALSE

15707|"_Recapitulation._"|FALSE

15707|"or martin, that builds against rocks and houses, covers her's with clay,"|FALSE
15707|"whilst the lark chooses vegetable straw nearly of the colour of the ground"|FALSE
15707|"she inhabits: by this contrivance, they are all less liable to be"|FALSE
15707|"discovered by their adversaries."|FALSE
15707|"2. Nor are the nests of the same species of birds constructed always of the"|FALSE
15707|"same materials, nor in the same form; which is another circumstance that"|FALSE

15707|"In the trees before Mr. Levet's house in Lichfield, there are annually"|FALSE
15707|"nests built by sparrows, a bird which usually builds under the tiles of"|FALSE

15707|"The following extract from a Letter of the Rev. Mr. J. Darwin, of Carleton"|FALSE
15707|"Scroop in Lincolnshire, authenticates a curious fact of this kind. \"When I"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned to you the circumstance of crows or rooks building in the spire"|FALSE
15707|"of Welbourn church, you expressed a desire of being well informed of the"|FALSE
15707|"certainty of the fact. Welbourn is situated in the road from Grantham to"|FALSE
15707|"Lincoln on the Cliff row; I yesterday took a ride thither, and enquired of"|FALSE
15707|"the rector, Mr. Ridgehill, whether the report was true, that rooks built in"|FALSE
15707|"the spire of his church. He assured me it was true, and that they had done"|FALSE
15707|"so time immemorial, as his parishioners affirmed. There was a common"|FALSE
15707|"tradition, he said, that formerly a rookery in some high trees adjoined the"|FALSE
15707|"church yard, which being cut down (probably in the spring, the building"|FALSE
15707|"season), the rooks removed to the church, and built their nests on the"|FALSE
15707|"outside of the spire on the tops of windows, which by their projection a"|FALSE
15707|"little from the spire made them convenient room, but that they built also"|FALSE
15707|"on the inside. I saw two nests made with sticks on the outside, and in the"|FALSE
15707|"spires, and Mr. Ridgehill said there were always a great many."|FALSE
15707|"\"I spent the day with Mr. Wright, a clergyman, at Fulbeck, near Welbourn,"|FALSE
15707|"and in the afternoon Dr. Ellis of Headenham, about two miles from Welbourn,"|FALSE
15707|"drank tea at Mr. Wright's, who said he remembered, when Mr. Welby lived at"|FALSE
15707|"Welbourn, that he received a letter from an acquaintance in the west of"|FALSE
15707|"England, desiring an answer, whether the report of rooks building in"|FALSE
15707|"Welbourn church was true, as a wager was depending on that subject; to"|FALSE

15707|"Aug. 30, 1794."|FALSE
15707|"So the jackdaw (corvus monedula) generally builds in church-steeples, or"|FALSE
15707|"under the roofs of high houses; but at Selbourn, in Southamptonshire, where"|FALSE

15707|"forsaken rabbit burrows. See a curious account of these subterranean nests"|FALSE
15707|"in White's History of Selbourn, p. 59. Can the skilful change of"|FALSE
15707|"architecture in these birds and the sparrows above mentioned be governed by"|FALSE
15707|"instinct? Then they must have two instincts, one for common, and the other"|FALSE
15707|"for extraordinary occasions."|FALSE
15707|"I have seen green worsted in a nest, which no where exists in nature: and"|FALSE
15707|"the down of thistles in those nests, that were by some accident constructed"|FALSE
15707|"later in the summer, which material could not be procured for the earlier"|FALSE
15707|"nests: in many different climates they cannot procure the same materials,"|FALSE
15707|"that they use in ours. And it is well known, that the canary birds, that"|FALSE

15707|"that are impervious to water.\" And in India there is a swallow that"|FALSE
15707|"collects a glutinous substance for this purpose, whose nest is esculent,"|FALSE
15707|"and esteemed a principal rarity amongst epicures, (Lin. Syst. Nat.) Both"|FALSE
15707|"these must be constructed of very different materials from those used by"|FALSE
15707|"the swallows of our country."|FALSE
15707|"In India the birds exert more artifice in building their nests on account"|FALSE

15707|"still more cautious, with an entrance at the very bottom, forming their"|FALSE
15707|"lodge near the summit. But the taylor-bird will not ever trust its nest to"|FALSE
15707|"the extremity of a tender twig, but makes one more advance to safety by"|FALSE
15707|"fixing it to the leaf itself. It picks up a dead leaf, and sews it to the"|FALSE
15707|"side of a living one, its slender bill being its needle, and its thread"|FALSE
15707|"some fine fibres; the lining consists of feathers, gossamer, and down; its"|FALSE
15707|"eggs are white, the colour of the bird light yellow, its length three"|FALSE
15707|"inches, its weight three sixteenths of an ounce; so that the materials of"|FALSE
15707|"the nest, and the weight of the bird, are not likely to draw down an"|FALSE
15707|"habitation so slightly suspended. A nest of this bird is preserved in the"|FALSE
15707|"British Museum, (Pennant's Indian Zoology). This calls to one's mind the"|FALSE
15707|"Mosaic account of the origin of mankind, the first dawning of art there"|FALSE

15707|"kinds of nests see Natural History for Children, by Mr. Galton. Johnson."|FALSE
15707|"London. Part I. p. 47. Gen. Oriolus."|FALSE
15707|"3. Those birds that are brought up by our care, and have had little"|FALSE
15707|"communication with others of their own species, are very defective in this"|FALSE
15707|"acquired knowledge; they are not only very awkward in the construction of"|FALSE
15707|"their nests, but generally scatter their eggs in various parts of the room"|FALSE
15707|"or cage, where they are confined, and seldom produce young ones, till, by"|FALSE
15707|"failing in their first attempt, they have learnt something from their own"|FALSE
15707|"observation."|FALSE
15707|"4. During the time of incubation birds are said in general to turn their"|FALSE
15707|"eggs every day; some cover them, when they leave the nest, as ducks and"|FALSE
15707|"geese; in some the male is said to bring food to the female, that she may"|FALSE
15707|"have less occasion of absence, in others he is said to take her place, when"|FALSE
15707|"she goes in quest of food; and all of them are said to leave their eggs a"|FALSE
15707|"shorter time in cold weather than in warm. In Senegal the ostrich sits on"|FALSE
15707|"her eggs only during the night, leaving them in the day to the heat of the"|FALSE
15707|"sun; but at the Cape of Good Hope, where the heat is less, she sits on them"|FALSE
15707|"day and night."|FALSE
15707|"If it should be asked, what induces a bird to sit weeks on its first eggs"|FALSE
15707|"unconscious that a brood of young ones will be the product? The answer must"|FALSE
15707|"be, that it is the same passion that induces the human mother to hold her"|FALSE
15707|"offspring whole nights and days in her fond arms, and press it to her"|FALSE
15707|"bosom, unconscious of its future growth to sense and manhood, till"|FALSE
15707|"observation or tradition have informed her."|FALSE
15707|"5. And as many ladies are too refined to nurse their own children, and"|FALSE
15707|"deliver them to the care and provision of others; so is there one instance"|FALSE
15707|"of this vice in the feathered world. The cuckoo in some parts of England,"|FALSE
15707|"as I am well informed by a very distinct and ingenious gentleman, hatches"|FALSE
15707|"and educates her own young; whilst in other parts she builds no nest, but"|FALSE
15707|"uses that of some lesser bird, generally either of the wagtail, or hedge"|FALSE
15707|"sparrow, and depositing one egg in it, takes no further care of her"|FALSE
15707|"progeny."|FALSE
15707|"As the Rev. Mr. Stafford was walking in Glosop Dale, in the Peak of"|FALSE
15707|"Derbyshire, he saw a cuckoo rise from its nest. The nest was on the stump"|FALSE
15707|"of a tree, that had been some time felled, among some chips that were in"|FALSE
15707|"part turned grey, so as much to resemble the colour of the bird, in this"|FALSE
15707|"nest were two young cuckoos: tying a string about the leg of one of them,"|FALSE
15707|"he pegged the other end of it to the ground, and very frequently for many"|FALSE
15707|"days beheld the old cuckoo feed these her young, as he stood very near"|FALSE
15707|"them."|FALSE
15707|"The following extract of a Letter from the Rev. Mr. Wilmot, of Morley, near"|FALSE
15707|"Derby, strengthens the truth of the fact above mentioned, of the cuckoo"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes making a nest, and hatching her own young."|FALSE
15707|"\"In the beginning of July 1792, I was attending some labourers on my farm,"|FALSE
15707|"when one of them said to me, \"There is a bird's nest upon one of the"|FALSE
15707|"Coal-slack Hills; the bird is now sitting, and is exactly like a cuckoo."|FALSE
15707|"They say that cuckoo's never hatch their own eggs, otherwise I should have"|FALSE
15707|"sworn it was one.\" He took me to the spot, it was in an open fallow ground;"|FALSE
15707|"the bird was upon the nest, I stood and observed her some time, and was"|FALSE
15707|"perfectly satisfied it was a cuckoo; I then put my hand towards her, and"|FALSE
15707|"she almost let me touch her before she rose from the nest, which she"|FALSE
15707|"appeared to quit with great uneasiness, skimming over the ground in the"|FALSE
15707|"manner that a hen partridge does when disturbed from a new hatched brood,"|FALSE
15707|"and went only to a thicket about forty or fifty yards from the nest; and"|FALSE
15707|"continued there as long as I staid to observe her, which was not many"|FALSE
15707|"minutes. In the nest, which was barely a hole scratched out of the"|FALSE
15707|"coal-slack in the manner of a plover's nest, I observed three eggs, but did"|FALSE
15707|"not touch them. As I had labourers constantly at work in that field, I went"|FALSE
15707|"thither every day, and always looked to see if the bird was there, but did"|FALSE
15707|"not disturb her for seven or eight days, when I was tempted to drive her"|FALSE
15707|"from the nest, and found _two_ young ones, that appeared to have been"|FALSE
15707|"hatched some days, but there was no appearance of the third egg. I then"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned this extraordinary circumstance (for such I thought it) to Mr."|FALSE
15707|"and Mrs. Holyoak of Bidford Grange, Warwickshire, and to Miss M. Willes,"|FALSE
15707|"who were on a visit at my house, and who all went to see it. Very lately I"|FALSE
15707|"reminded Mr. Holyoak of it, who told me he had a perfect recollection of"|FALSE
15707|"the whole, and that, considering it a curiosity, he walked to look at it"|FALSE
15707|"several times, was perfectly satisfied as to its being a cuckoo, and"|FALSE
15707|"thought her more attentive to her young, than any other bird he ever"|FALSE
15707|"observed, having always found her brooding her young. In about a week after"|FALSE
15707|"I first saw the young ones, one of them was missing, and I rather suspected"|FALSE
15707|"my plough-boys having taken it; though it might possibly have been taken by"|FALSE
15707|"a hawk, some time when the old one was seeking food. I never found her off"|FALSE
15707|"her nest but once, and that was the last time I saw the remaining young"|FALSE
15707|"one, when it was almost full feathered. I then went from home for two or"|FALSE
15707|"three days, and, when I returned, the young one was gone, which I take for"|FALSE
15707|"granted had flown. Though during this time I frequently saw cuckoos in the"|FALSE
15707|"thicket I mention, I never observed any one, that I supposed to be the"|FALSE
15707|"cock-bird, paired with this hen.\""|FALSE
15707|"Nor is this a new observation, though it is entirely overlooked by the"|FALSE
15707|"modern naturalists, for Aristotle speaking of the cuckoo, asserts that she"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes builds her nest among broken rocks, and on high mountains, (L. 6."|FALSE
15707|"H. c. 1.) but adds in another place that she generally possesses the nest"|FALSE
15707|"of another bird, (L. 6. H. c. 7.) And Niphus says that cuckoos rarely build"|FALSE
15707|"for themselves, most frequently laying their eggs in the nests of other"|FALSE
15707|"birds, (Gesner, L. 3. de Cuculo.)"|FALSE
15707|"The Philosopher who is acquainted with these facts concerning the cuckoo,"|FALSE
15707|"would seem to have very little _reason_ himself, if he could imagine this"|FALSE
15707|"neglect of her young to be a necessary _instinct_!"|FALSE
15707|"XIV. The deep recesses of the ocean are inaccessible to mankind, which"|FALSE
15707|"prevents us from having much knowledge of the arts and government of its"|FALSE
15707|"inhabitants."|FALSE
15707|"1. One of the baits used by the fisherman is an animal called an Old"|FALSE
15707|"Soldier, his size and form are somewhat like the craw-fish, with this"|FALSE
15707|"difference, that his tail is covered with a tough membrane instead of a"|FALSE
15707|"shell; and to obviate this defect, he seeks out the uninhabited shell of"|FALSE
15707|"some dead fish, that is large enough to receive his tail, and carries it"|FALSE
15707|"about with him as part of his clothing or armour."|FALSE
15707|"2. On the coasts about Scarborough, where the haddocks, cods, and dog-fish,"|FALSE
15707|"are in great abundance, the fishermen universally believe that the dog-fish"|FALSE
15707|"make a line, or semicircle, to encompass a shoal of haddocks and cod,"|FALSE
15707|"confining them within certain limits near the shore, and eating them as"|FALSE
15707|"occasion requires. For the haddocks and cod are always found near the shore"|FALSE
15707|"without any dog-fish among them, and the dog-fish further off without any"|FALSE
15707|"haddocks or cod; and yet the former are known to prey upon the latter, and"|FALSE
15707|"in some years devour such immense quantities as to render this fishery more"|FALSE
15707|"expensive than profitable."|FALSE
15707|"3. The remora, when he wishes to remove his situation, as he is a very slow"|FALSE
15707|"swimmer, is content to take an outside place on whatever conveyance is"|FALSE
15707|"going his way; nor can the cunning animal be tempted to quit his hold of a"|FALSE
15707|"ship when she is sailing, not even for the lucre of a piece of pork, lest"|FALSE
15707|"it should endanger the loss of his passage: at other times he is easily"|FALSE
15707|"caught with the hook."|FALSE
15707|"4. The crab-fish, like many other testaceous animals, annually changes its"|FALSE
15707|"shell; it is then in a soft state, covered only with a mucous membrane, and"|FALSE
15707|"conceals itself in holes in the sand or under weeds; at this place a hard"|FALSE
15707|"shelled crab always stands centinel, to prevent the sea insects from"|FALSE
15707|"injuring the other in its defenceless state; and the fishermen from his"|FALSE
15707|"appearance know where to find the soft ones, which they use for baits in"|FALSE
15707|"catching other fish."|FALSE
15707|"And though the hard shelled crab, when he is on this duty, advances boldly"|FALSE
15707|"to meet the foe, and will with difficulty quit the field; yet at other"|FALSE
15707|"times he shews great timidity, and has a wonderful speed in attempting his"|FALSE
15707|"escape; and, if often interrupted, will pretend death like the spider, and"|FALSE
15707|"watch an opportunity to sink himself into the sand, keeping only his eyes"|FALSE
15707|"above. My ingenious friend Mr. Burdett, who favoured me with these accounts"|FALSE
15707|"at the time he was surveying the coasts, thinks the commerce between the"|FALSE
15707|"sexes takes place at this time, and inspires the courage of the creature."|FALSE
15707|"5. The shoals of herrings, cods, haddocks, and other fish, which approach"|FALSE
15707|"our shores at certain seasons, and quit them at other seasons without"|FALSE
15707|"leaving one behind; and the salmon, that periodically frequent our rivers,"|FALSE
15707|"evince, that there are vagrant tribes of fish, that perform as regular"|FALSE
15707|"migrations as the birds of passage already mentioned."|FALSE
15707|"6. There is a cataract on the river Liffey in Ireland about nineteen feet"|FALSE
15707|"high: here in the salmon season many of the inhabitants amuse themselves in"|FALSE
15707|"observing these fish leap up the torrent. They dart themselves quite out of"|FALSE
15707|"the water as they ascend, and frequently fall back many times before they"|FALSE
15707|"surmount it, and baskets made of twigs are placed near the edge of the"|FALSE
15707|"stream to catch them in their fall."|FALSE
15707|"I have observed, as I have sat by a spout of water, which descends from a"|FALSE
15707|"stone trough about two feet into a stream below, at particular seasons of"|FALSE
15707|"the year, a great number of little fish called minums, or pinks, throw"|FALSE
15707|"themselves about twenty times their own length out of the water, expecting"|FALSE
15707|"to get into the trough above."|FALSE
15707|"This evinces that the storgee, or attention of the dam to provide for the"|FALSE
15707|"offspring, is strongly exerted amongst the nations of fish, where it would"|FALSE
15707|"seem to be the most neglected; as these salmon cannot be supposed to"|FALSE
15707|"attempt so difficult and dangerous a task without being conscious of the"|FALSE
15707|"purpose or end of their endeavours."|FALSE
15707|"It is further remarkable, that most of the old salmon return to the sea"|FALSE
15707|"before it is proper for the young shoals to attend them, yet that a few old"|FALSE
15707|"ones continue in the rivers so late, that they become perfectly emaciated"|FALSE
15707|"by the inconvenience of their situation, and this apparently to guide or to"|FALSE
15707|"protect the unexperienced brood."|FALSE
15707|"Of the smaller water animals we have still less knowledge, who nevertheless"|FALSE
15707|"probably possess many superior arts; some of these are mentioned in Botanic"|FALSE
15707|"Garden, P. I. Add. Note XXVII. and XXVIII. The nympha of the water-moths of"|FALSE
15707|"our rivers, which cover themselves with cases of straw, gravel, and shell,"|FALSE
15707|"contrive to make their habitations, nearly in equilibrium with the water;"|FALSE
15707|"when too heavy, they add a bit of wood or straw; when too light, a bit of"|FALSE
15707|"gravel. Edinb. Trans."|FALSE
15707|"All these circumstances bear a near resemblance to the deliberate actions"|FALSE
15707|"of human reason."|FALSE
15707|"XV. We have a very imperfect acquaintance with the various tribes of"|FALSE
15707|"insects: their occupations, manner of life, and even the number of their"|FALSE
15707|"senses, differ from our own, and from each other; but there is reason to"|FALSE
15707|"imagine, that those which possess the sense of touch in the most exquisite"|FALSE
15707|"degree, and whole occupations require the most constant exertion of their"|FALSE
15707|"powers, are induced with a greater proportion or knowledge and ingenuity."|FALSE
15707|"The spiders of this country manufacture nets of various forms, adapted to"|FALSE
15707|"various situations, to arrest the flies that are their food; and some of"|FALSE
15707|"them have a house or lodging-place in the middle of the net, well contrived"|FALSE
15707|"for warmth, security, or concealment. There is a large spider in South"|FALSE
15707|"America, who constructs nets of so strong a texture as to entangle small"|FALSE
15707|"birds, particularly the humming bird. And in Jamaica there is another"|FALSE
15707|"spider, who digs a hole in the earth obliquely downwards, about three"|FALSE
15707|"inches in length, and one inch in diameter, this cavity she lines with a"|FALSE
15707|"tough thick web, which when taken out resembles a leathern purse: but what"|FALSE
15707|"is most curious, this house has a door with hinges, like the operculum of"|FALSE
15707|"some sea shells; and herself and family, who tenant this nest, open and"|FALSE
15707|"shut the door, whenever they pass or repass. This history was told me, and"|FALSE
15707|"the nest with its operculum shewn me by the late Dr. Butt of Bath, who was"|FALSE
15707|"some years physician in Jamaica."|FALSE
15707|"The production of these nets is indeed a part of the nature or conformation"|FALSE
15707|"of the animal, and their natural use is to supply the place of wings, when"|FALSE
15707|"she wishes to remove to another situation. But when she employs them to"|FALSE
15707|"entangle her prey, there are marks of evident design, for she adapts the"|FALSE
15707|"form of each net to its situation, and strengthens those lines, that"|FALSE
15707|"require it, by joining others to the middle of them, and attaching those"|FALSE
15707|"others to distant objects, with the same individual art, that is used by"|FALSE
15707|"mankind in supporting the masts and extending the sails of ships. This work"|FALSE
15707|"is executed with more mathematical exactness and ingenuity by the field"|FALSE
15707|"spiders, than by those in our houses, as their constructions are more"|FALSE
15707|"subjected to the injuries of dews and tempests."|FALSE
15707|"Besides the ingenuity shewn by these little creatures in taking their prey,"|FALSE
15707|"the circumstance of their counterfeiting death, when they are put into"|FALSE
15707|"terror, is truly wonderful; and as soon as the object of terror is removed,"|FALSE
15707|"they recover and run away. Some beetles are also said to possess this piece"|FALSE
15707|"of hypocrisy."|FALSE
15707|"The curious webs, or chords, constructed by some young caterpillars to"|FALSE
15707|"defend themselves from cold, or from insects of prey; and by silk-worms and"|FALSE
15707|"some other caterpillars, when they transmigrate into aureliæ or larvæ, have"|FALSE
15707|"deservedly excited the admiration of the inquisitive. But our ignorance of"|FALSE
15707|"their manner of life, and even of the number of their senses, totally"|FALSE
15707|"precludes us from understanding the means by which they acquire this"|FALSE
15707|"knowledge."|FALSE
15707|"The care of the salmon in choosing a proper situation for her spawn, the"|FALSE
15707|"structure of the nests of birds, their patient incubation, and the art of"|FALSE
15707|"the cuckoo in depositing her egg in her neighbour's nursery, are instances"|FALSE
15707|"of great sagacity in those creatures: and yet they are much inferior to the"|FALSE
15707|"arts exerted by many of the insect tribes on similar occasions. The hairy"|FALSE
15707|"excrescences on briars, the oak apples, the blasted leaves of trees, and"|FALSE
15707|"the lumps on the backs of cows, are situations that are rather produced"|FALSE
15707|"than chosen by the mother insect for the convenience of her offspring. The"|FALSE
15707|"cells of bees, wasps, spiders, and of the various coralline insects,"|FALSE
15707|"equally astonish us, whether we attend to the materials or to the"|FALSE
15707|"architecture."|FALSE
15707|"But the conduct of the ant, and of some species of the ichneumon fly in the"|FALSE
15707|"incubation of their eggs, is equal to any exertion of human science. The"|FALSE
15707|"ants many times in a day move their eggs nearer the surface of their"|FALSE
15707|"habitation, or deeper below it, as the heat of the weather varies; and in"|FALSE
15707|"colder days lie upon them in heaps for the purpose of incubation: if their"|FALSE
15707|"mansion is too dry, they carry them to places where there is moisture, and"|FALSE
15707|"you may distinctly see the little worms move and suck up the water. When"|FALSE
15707|"too much moisture approaches their nest, they convey their eggs deeper in"|FALSE
15707|"the earth, or to some other place of safety. (Swammerd. Epil. ad Hist."|FALSE
15707|"Insects, p. 153. Phil. Trans. No. 23. Lowthrop. V. 2. p. 7.)"|FALSE
15707|"There is one species of ichneumon-fly, that digs a hole in the earth, and"|FALSE
15707|"carrying into it two or three living caterpillars, deposits her eggs, and"|FALSE
15707|"nicely closing up the nest leaves them there; partly doubtless to assist"|FALSE
15707|"the incubation, and partly to supply food to her future young, (Derham. B."|FALSE
15707|"4, c. 13. Aristotle Hist. Animal, L. 5. c. 20.)"|FALSE
15707|"A friend of mine put about fifty large caterpillars collected from cabbages"|FALSE

15707|"out of their backs, and spin each a small cocoon of silk, and in a few days"|FALSE

15707|"accurate knowledge, and as subtle invention, as the discoverers of human"|FALSE

15707|"that are formed into societies, as the bees, wasps, and ants, I make no"|FALSE
15707|"doubt but we should find, that their arts and improvements are not so"|FALSE
15707|"similar and uniform as they now appear to us, but that they arose in the"|FALSE

15707|"There are some kinds of insects that migrate like the birds before"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned. The locust of warmer climates has sometimes come over to"|FALSE
15707|"England; it is shaped like a grasshopper, with very large wings, and a body"|FALSE
15707|"above an inch in length. It is mentioned as coming into Egypt with an east"|FALSE
15707|"wind, \"The lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and night,"|FALSE
15707|"and in the morning the east wind brought the locusts, and covered the face"|FALSE
15707|"of the earth, so that the land was dark,\" Exod. x. 13. The migrations of"|FALSE
15707|"these insects are mentioned in another part of the scripture, \"The locusts"|FALSE
15707|"have no king, yet go they forth all of them in bands,\" Prov. xxx. 27."|FALSE
15707|"The accurate Mr. Adanson, near the river Gambia in Africa, was witness to"|FALSE
15707|"the migration of these insects. \"About eight in the morning, in the month"|FALSE
15707|"of February, there suddenly arose over our heads a thick cloud, which"|FALSE
15707|"darkened the air, and deprived us of the rays of the sun. We found it was a"|FALSE
15707|"cloud of locusts raised about twenty or thirty fathoms from the ground, and"|FALSE
15707|"covering an extent of several leagues; at length a shower of these insects"|FALSE
15707|"descended, and after devouring every green herb, while they rested, again"|FALSE

15707|"they found it not useful to them: and are now become very troublesome to"|FALSE
15707|"the inhabitants of those islands by infesting their sugar houses; but those"|FALSE
15707|"in Jamaica continue to make honey, as the cold north winds, or rainy"|FALSE
15707|"seasons of that island, confine them at home for several weeks together."|FALSE
15707|"And the bees of Senegal, which differ from those of Europe only in size,"|FALSE
15707|"make their honey not only superior to ours in delicacy of flavour, but it"|FALSE
15707|"has this singularity, that it never concretes, but remains liquid as syrup,"|FALSE
15707|"(Adanson). From some observations of Mr. Wildman, and of other people of"|FALSE
15707|"veracity, it appears, that during the severe part of the winter season for"|FALSE
15707|"weeks together the bees are quite benumbed and torpid from the cold, and do"|FALSE
15707|"not consume any of their provision. This state of sleep, like that of"|FALSE
15707|"swallows and bats, seems to be the natural resource of those creatures in"|FALSE
15707|"cold climates, and the making of honey to be an artificial improvement."|FALSE
15707|"As the death of our hives of bees appears to be owning to their being kept"|FALSE
15707|"so warm, as to require food when their stock is exhausted; a very observing"|FALSE
15707|"gentleman at my request put two hives for many weeks into a dry cellar, and"|FALSE
15707|"observed, during all that time, they did not consume any of their"|FALSE

15707|"adds, that those on the north side of his house consumed less honey in the"|FALSE

15707|"There is another observation on bees well ascertained, that they at various"|FALSE
15707|"times, when the season begins to be cold, by a general motion of their legs"|FALSE

15707|"from their own previous experience or observation, all the actions of"|FALSE
15707|"mankind must be resolved into instinct."|FALSE
15707|"3. The dormouse consumes but little of its food during the rigour of the"|FALSE

15707|"part of the time; but on warm sunny days experience a short revival, and"|FALSE
15707|"take a little food, and then relapse into their former state.\" (Pennant"|FALSE
15707|"Zoolog. p. 67.) Other animals, that sleep in winter without laying up any"|FALSE
15707|"provender, are observed to go into their winter beds fat and strong, but"|FALSE
15707|"return to day-light in the spring season very lean and feeble. The common"|FALSE
15707|"flies sleep during the winter without any provision for their nourishment,"|FALSE
15707|"and are daily revived by the warmth of the sun, or of our fires. These"|FALSE
15707|"whenever they see light endeavour to approach it, having observed, that by"|FALSE
15707|"its greater vicinity they get free from the degree of torpor, that the cold"|FALSE

15707|"Whilst many of the subterraneous insects, as the common worms, seem to"|FALSE
15707|"retreat so deep into the earth as not to be enlivened or awakened by the"|FALSE

15707|"hangs it on the bough of a tree, where the seasons are less severe. He"|FALSE
15707|"weaves a very curious paper of vegetable fibres to cover his nest, which is"|FALSE
15707|"constructed on the same principle with that of the bee, but with a"|FALSE

15707|"M. de la Loubiere, in his relation of Siam, says, \"That in a part of that"|FALSE

15707|"Whereas in our country the ground is their only situation. From the"|FALSE

15707|"same, (Cont. Cels. L. 4.) But it is generally believed that in this country"|FALSE
15707|"they do not, (Prov. vi. 6. xxx. 25.) The white ants of the coast of Africa"|FALSE

15707|"One circumstance I shall relate which fell under my own eye, and shewed the"|FALSE

15707|"rose about two feet from the ground with it; but a gentle breeze wafting"|FALSE
15707|"the wings of the fly turned him round in the air, and he settled again with"|FALSE
15707|"his prey upon the gravel. I then distinctly observed him cut off with his"|FALSE

15707|"Go, proud reasoner, and call the worm thy sister!"|FALSE
15707|"XVII. _Conclusion._"|FALSE
15707|"It was before observed how much the superior accuracy of our sense of touch"|FALSE
15707|"contributes to increase our knowledge; but it is the greater energy and"|FALSE

15707|"always employed about the _means_ to acquire pleasureable objects, or to"|FALSE
15707|"avoid painful ones: while the latter are employed about the _possession_ of"|FALSE
15707|"those that are already in our power.\""|FALSE
15707|"If we turn our eyes upon the fabric of our fellow animals, we find they are"|FALSE
15707|"supported with bones, covered with skins, moved by muscles; that they"|FALSE
15707|"possess the same senses, acknowledge the same appetites, and are nourished"|FALSE
15707|"by the same aliment with ourselves; and we should hence conclude from the"|FALSE
15707|"strongest analogy, that their internal faculties were also in some measure"|FALSE
15707|"similar to our own."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. Locke indeed published an opinion, that other animals possessed no"|FALSE
15707|"abstract or general ideas, and thought this circumstance was the barrier"|FALSE
15707|"between the brute and the human world. But these abstracted ideas have been"|FALSE
15707|"since demonstrated by Bishop Berkley, and allowed by Mr. Hume, to have no"|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. To investigate with precision the catenations of animal motions, it"|FALSE
15707|"would be well to attend to the manner of their production; but we cannot"|FALSE
15707|"begin this disquisition early enough for this purpose, as the catenations"|FALSE
15707|"of motion seem to begin with life, and are only extinguishable with it; We"|FALSE
15707|"have spoken of the power of irritation, of sensation, of volition, and of"|FALSE
15707|"association, as preceding the fibrous motions; we now step forwards, and"|FALSE
15707|"consider, that conversely they are in their turn preceded by those motions;"|FALSE
15707|"and that all the successive trains or circles of our actions are composed"|FALSE
15707|"of this twofold concatenation. Those we shall call trains of action, which"|FALSE
15707|"continue to proceed without any stated repetitions; and those circles of"|FALSE
15707|"action, when the parts of them return at certain periods, though the"|FALSE
15707|"trains, of which they consist, are not exactly similar. The reading an epic"|FALSE
15707|"poem is a train of actions; the reading a song with a chorus at equal"|FALSE
15707|"distances in the measure constitutes so many circles of action."|FALSE
15707|"2. Some catenations of animal motion are produced by reiterated successive"|FALSE
15707|"irritations, as when we learn to repeat the alphabet in its order by"|FALSE
15707|"frequently reading the letters of it. Thus the vermicular motions of the"|FALSE
15707|"bowels were originally produced by the successive irritations of the"|FALSE
15707|"passing aliment; and the succession of actions of the auricles and"|FALSE
15707|"ventricles of the heart was originally formed by successive stimulus of the"|FALSE
15707|"blood, these afterwards become part of the diurnal circles of animal"|FALSE
15707|"actions, as appears by the periodical returns of hunger, and the quickened"|FALSE
15707|"pulse of weak people in the evening."|FALSE
15707|"Other catenations of animal motion are gradually acquired by successive"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable sensations, as in learning a favourite song or dance; others by"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensations, as in coughing or nictitation; these become"|FALSE
15707|"associated by frequent repetition, and afterwards compose parts of greater"|FALSE
15707|"circles of action like those above mentioned."|FALSE
15707|"Other catenations of motions are gradually acquired by frequent voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"repetitions; as when we deliberately learn to march, read, fence, or any"|FALSE
15707|"mechanic art, the motions of many of our muscles become gradually linked"|FALSE
15707|"together in trains, tribes, or circles of action. Thus when any one at"|FALSE
15707|"first begins to use the tools in turning wood or metals in a lathe, he"|FALSE
15707|"wills the motions of his hand or fingers, till at length these actions"|FALSE
15707|"become so connected with the effect, that he seems only to will the point"|FALSE
15707|"of the chisel. These are caused by volition, connected by association like"|FALSE
15707|"those above described, and afterwards become parts of our diurnal trains or"|FALSE
15707|"circles of action."|FALSE
15707|"3. All these catenations of animal motions, are liable to proceed some time"|FALSE
15707|"after they are excited, unless they are disturbed or impeded by other"|FALSE
15707|"irritations, sensations, or volitions; and in many instances in spite of"|FALSE
15707|"our endeavours to stop them; and this property of animal motions is"|FALSE
15707|"probably the cause of their catenation. Thus when a child revolves some"|FALSE
15707|"minute on one foot, the spectra of the ambient objects appear to circulate"|FALSE
15707|"round him some time after he falls upon the ground. Thus the palpitation of"|FALSE
15707|"the heart continues some time after the object of fear, which occasioned"|FALSE
15707|"it, is removed. The blush of shame, which is an excess of sensation, and"|FALSE
15707|"the glow of anger, which is an excess of volition, continue some time,"|FALSE
15707|"though the affected person finds, that those emotions were caused by"|FALSE
15707|"mistaken facts, and endeavours to extinguish their appearance. See Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XII. 1. 5."|FALSE
15707|"4. When a circle of motions becomes connected, by frequent repetitions as"|FALSE
15707|"above, we can exert our attention strongly on other objects, and the"|FALSE
15707|"concatenated circle of motions will nevertheless proceed in due order; as"|FALSE
15707|"whilst you are thinking on this subject, you use variety of muscles in"|FALSE
15707|"walking about your parlour, or in sitting at your writing-table."|FALSE
15707|"5. Innumerable catenations of motions may proceed at the same time, without"|FALSE
15707|"incommoding each other. Of these are the motions of the heart and arteries;"|FALSE
15707|"those of digestion and glandular secretion; of the ideas, or sensual"|FALSE
15707|"motions; those of progression, and of speaking; the great annual circle of"|FALSE
15707|"actions so apparent in birds in their times of breeding and moulting; the"|FALSE
15707|"monthly circles of many female animals; and the diurnal circles of sleeping"|FALSE
15707|"and waking, of fulness and inanition."|FALSE
15707|"6. Some links of successive trains or of synchronous tribes of action may"|FALSE
15707|"be left out without disjoining the whole. Such are our usual trains of"|FALSE
15707|"recollection; after having travelled through an entertaining country, and"|FALSE
15707|"viewed many delightful lawns, rolling rivers, and echoing rocks; in the"|FALSE
15707|"recollection of our journey we leave out the many districts, that we"|FALSE
15707|"crossed, which were marked with no peculiar pleasure. Such also are our"|FALSE
15707|"complex ideas, they are catenated tribes of ideas, which do not perfectly"|FALSE
15707|"resemble their correspondent perceptions, because some of the parts are"|FALSE
15707|"omitted."|FALSE
15707|"7. If an interrupted circle of actions is not entirely dissevered, it will"|FALSE
15707|"continue to proceed confusedly, till it comes to the part of the circle,"|FALSE
15707|"where it was interrupted."|FALSE
15707|"The vital motions in a fever from drunkenness, and in other periodical"|FALSE
15707|"diseases, are instances of this circumstance. The accidental inebriate does"|FALSE
15707|"not recover himself perfectly till about the same hour on the succeeding"|FALSE
15707|"day. The accustomed drunkard is disordered, if he has not his usual"|FALSE
15707|"potation of fermented liquor. So if a considerable part of a connected"|FALSE
15707|"tribe of action be disturbed, that whole tribe goes on with confusion, till"|FALSE
15707|"the part of the tribe affected regains its accustomed catenations. So"|FALSE
15707|"vertigo produces vomiting, and a great secretion of bile, as in"|FALSE
15707|"sea-sickness, all these being parts of the tribe of irritative catenations."|FALSE
15707|"8. Weaker catenated trains may be dissevered by the sudden exertion of the"|FALSE
15707|"stronger. When a child first attempts to walk across a room, call to him,"|FALSE
15707|"and he instantly falls upon the ground. So while I am thinking over the"|FALSE
15707|"virtues of my friends, if the tea-kettle spurt out some hot water on my"|FALSE
15707|"stocking; the sudden pain breaks the weaker chain of ideas, and introduces"|FALSE
15707|"a new group of figures of its own. This circumstance is extended to some"|FALSE
15707|"unnatural trains of action, which have not been confirmed by long habit; as"|FALSE
15707|"the hiccough, or an ague-fit, which are frequently curable by surprise. A"|FALSE
15707|"young lady about eleven years old had for five days had a contraction of"|FALSE
15707|"one muscle in her fore arm, and another in her arm, which occurred four or"|FALSE
15707|"five times every minute; the muscles were seen to leap, but without bending"|FALSE
15707|"the arm. To counteract this new morbid habit, an issue was placed over the"|FALSE
15707|"convulsed muscle of her arm, and an adhesive plaster wrapped tight like a"|FALSE
15707|"bandage over the whole fore arm, by which the new motions were immediately"|FALSE
15707|"destroyed, but the means were continued some weeks to prevent a return."|FALSE
15707|"9. If any circle of actions is dissevered, either by omission of some of"|FALSE
15707|"the links, as in sleep, or by insertion of other links, as in surprise, new"|FALSE
15707|"catenations take place in a greater or less degree. The last link of the"|FALSE
15707|"broken chain of actions becomes connected with the new motion which has"|FALSE
15707|"broken it, or with that which was nearest the link omitted; and these new"|FALSE
15707|"catenations proceed instead of the old ones. Hence the periodic returns of"|FALSE
15707|"ague-fits, and the chimeras of our dreams."|FALSE
15707|"10. If a train of actions is dissevered, much effort of volition or"|FALSE
15707|"sensation will prevent its being restored. Thus in the common impediment of"|FALSE
15707|"speech, when the association of the motions of the muscles of enunciation"|FALSE
15707|"with the idea of the word to be spoken is disordered, the great voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"efforts, which distort the countenance, prevent the rejoining of the broken"|FALSE
15707|"associations. See No. II. 10. of this Section. It is thus likewise"|FALSE
15707|"observable in some inflammations of the bowels, the too strong efforts made"|FALSE
15707|"by the muscles to carry forwards the offending material fixes it more"|FALSE
15707|"firmly in its place, and prevents the cure. So in endeavouring to recal to"|FALSE
15707|"our memory some particular word of a sentence, if we exert ourselves too"|FALSE
15707|"strongly about it, we are less likely to regain it."|FALSE
15707|"11. Catenated trains or tribes of action are easier dissevered than"|FALSE
15707|"catenated circles of action. Hence in epileptic fits the synchronous"|FALSE
15707|"connected tribes of action, which keep the body erect, are dissevered, but"|FALSE
15707|"the circle of vital motions continues undisturbed."|FALSE
15707|"12. Sleep destroys the power of volition, and precludes the stimuli of"|FALSE
15707|"external objects, and thence dissevers the trains, of which these are a"|FALSE
15707|"part; which confirms the other catenations, as those of the vital motions,"|FALSE
15707|"secretions, and absorptions; and produces the new trains of ideas, which"|FALSE
15707|"constitute our dreams."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. All the preceding circumstances of the catenations of animal motions"|FALSE
15707|"will be more clearly understood by the following example of a person"|FALSE
15707|"learning music; and when we recollect the variety of mechanic arts, which"|FALSE
15707|"are performed by associated trains of muscular actions catenated with the"|FALSE
15707|"effects they produce, as in knitting, netting, weaving; and the greater"|FALSE
15707|"variety of associated trains of ideas caused or catenated by volitions or"|FALSE
15707|"sensations, as in our hourly modes of reasoning, or imagining, or"|FALSE
15707|"recollecting, we shall gain some idea of the innumerable catenated trains"|FALSE
15707|"and circles of action, which form the tenor of our lives, and which began,"|FALSE
15707|"and will only cease entirely with them."|FALSE
15707|"2. When a young lady begins to learn music, she voluntarily applies herself"|FALSE
15707|"to the characters of her music-book, and by many repetitions endeavours to"|FALSE
15707|"catenate them with the proportions of sound, of which they are symbols. The"|FALSE
15707|"ideas excited by the musical characters are slowly connected with the keys"|FALSE
15707|"of the harpsichord, and much effort is necessary to produce every note with"|FALSE
15707|"the proper finger, and in its due place and time; till at length a train of"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary exertions becomes catenated with certain irritations. As the"|FALSE
15707|"various notes by frequent repetitions become connected in the order, in"|FALSE
15707|"which they are produced, a new catenation of sensitive exertions becomes"|FALSE
15707|"mixed with the voluntary ones above described; and not only the musical"|FALSE
15707|"symbols of crotchets and quavers, but the auditory notes and tones at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time, become so many successive or synchronous links in this circle of"|FALSE
15707|"catenated actions."|FALSE
15707|"At length the motions of her fingers become catenated with the musical"|FALSE
15707|"characters; and these no sooner strike the eye, than the finger presses"|FALSE
15707|"down the key without any voluntary attention between them; the activity of"|FALSE
15707|"the hand being connected with the irritation of the figure or place of the"|FALSE
15707|"musical symbol on the retina; till at length by frequent repetitions of the"|FALSE
15707|"same tune the movements of her fingers in playing, and the muscles of the"|FALSE
15707|"larynx in singing, become associated with each other, and form part of"|FALSE
15707|"those intricate trains and circles of catenated motions, according with the"|FALSE
15707|"second article of the preceding propositions in No. 1. of this Section."|FALSE
15707|"3. Besides the facility, which by habit attends the execution of this"|FALSE
15707|"musical performance, a curious circumstance occurs, which is, that when our"|FALSE
15707|"young musician has began a tune, she finds herself inclined to continue it;"|FALSE
15707|"and that even when she is carelessly singing alone without attending to her"|FALSE
15707|"own song; according with the third preceding article."|FALSE
15707|"4. At the same time that our young performer continues to play with great"|FALSE
15707|"exactness this accustomed tune, she can bend her mind, and that intensely,"|FALSE
15707|"on some other object, according with the fourth article of the preceding"|FALSE
15707|"proportions."|FALSE
15707|"The manuscript copy of this work was lent to many of my friends at"|FALSE
15707|"different times for the purpose of gaining their opinions and criticisms on"|FALSE
15707|"many parts of it, and I found the following anecdote written with a pencil"|FALSE
15707|"opposite to this page, but am not certain by whom. \"I remember seeing the"|FALSE
15707|"pretty young actress, who succeeded Mrs. Arne in the performance of the"|FALSE
15707|"celebrated Padlock, rehearse the musical parts at her harpsichord under the"|FALSE
15707|"eye of her master with great taste and accuracy; though I observed her"|FALSE
15707|"countenance full of emotion, which I could not account for; at last she"|FALSE
15707|"suddenly burst into tears; for she had all this time been eyeing a beloved"|FALSE
15707|"canary bird, suffering great agonies, which at that instant fell dead from"|FALSE
15707|"its perch.\""|FALSE
15707|"5. At the same time many other catenated circles of action are going on in"|FALSE
15707|"the person of our fair musician, as well as the motions of her fingers,"|FALSE
15707|"such as the vital motions, respiration, the movements of her eyes and"|FALSE
15707|"eyelids, and of the intricate muscles of vocality, according with the fifth"|FALSE
15707|"preceding article."|FALSE
15707|"6. If by any strong impression on the mind of our fair musician she should"|FALSE
15707|"be interrupted for a very inconsiderable time, she can still continue her"|FALSE
15707|"performance, according to the sixth article."|FALSE
15707|"7. If however this interruption be greater, though the chain of actions be"|FALSE
15707|"not dissevered, it proceeds confusedly, and our young performer continues"|FALSE
15707|"indeed to play, but in a hurry without accuracy and elegance, till she"|FALSE
15707|"begins the tune again, according to the seventh of the preceding articles."|FALSE
15707|"8. But if this interruption be still greater, the circle of actions becomes"|FALSE
15707|"entirely dissevered, and she finds herself immediately under the necessity"|FALSE
15707|"to begin over again to recover the lost catenation, according to the eighth"|FALSE
15707|"preceding article."|FALSE
15707|"9. Or in trying to recover it she will sing some dissonant notes, or strike"|FALSE
15707|"some improper keys, according to the ninth preceding article."|FALSE
15707|"10. A very remarkable thing attends this breach of catenation, if the"|FALSE
15707|"performer has forgotten some word of her song, the more energy of mind she"|FALSE
15707|"uses about it, the more distant is she from regaining it; and artfully"|FALSE
15707|"employs her mind in part on some other object, or endeavours to dull its"|FALSE
15707|"perceptions, continuing to repeat, as it were inconsciously, the former"|FALSE
15707|"part of the song, that she remembers, in hopes to regain the lost"|FALSE
15707|"connexion."|FALSE
15707|"For if the activity of the mind itself be more energetic, or takes its"|FALSE
15707|"attention more, than the connecting word, which is wanted; it will not"|FALSE
15707|"perceive the slighter link of this lost word; as who listens to a feeble"|FALSE
15707|"sound, must be very silent and motionless; so that in this case the very"|FALSE
15707|"vigour of the mind itself seems to prevent it from regaining the lost"|FALSE
15707|"catenation, as well as the too great exertion in endeavouring to regain it,"|FALSE
15707|"according to the tenth preceding article."|FALSE
15707|"We frequently experience, when we are doubtful about the spelling of a"|FALSE
15707|"word, that the greater voluntary exertion we use, that is the more"|FALSE
15707|"intensely we think about it, the further are we from regaining the lost"|FALSE
15707|"association between the letters of it, but which readily recurs when we"|FALSE
15707|"have become careless about it. In the same manner, after having for an hour"|FALSE
15707|"laboured to recollect the name of some absent person, it shall seem,"|FALSE
15707|"particularly after sleep, to come into the mind as it were spontaneously;"|FALSE
15707|"that is the word we are in search of, was joined to the preceding one by"|FALSE
15707|"association; this association being dissevered, we endeavour to recover it"|FALSE
15707|"by volition; this very action of the mind strikes our attention more, than"|FALSE
15707|"the faint link of association, and we find it impossible by this means to"|FALSE
15707|"retrieve the lost word. After sleep, when volition is entirely suspended,"|FALSE
15707|"the mind becomes capable of perceiving the fainter link of association, and"|FALSE
15707|"the word is regained."|FALSE
15707|"On this circumstance depends the impediment of speech before mentioned; the"|FALSE
15707|"first syllable of a word is causable by volition, but the remainder of it"|FALSE
15707|"is in common conversation introduced by its associations with this first"|FALSE
15707|"syllable acquired by long habit. Hence when the mind of the stammerer is"|FALSE
15707|"vehemently employed on some idea of ambition of shining, or fear of not"|FALSE
15707|"succeeding, the associations of the motions of the muscles of articulation"|FALSE
15707|"with each other become dissevered by this greater exertion, and he"|FALSE
15707|"endeavours in vain by voluntary efforts to rejoin the broken association."|FALSE
15707|"For this purpose he continues to repeat the first syllable, which is"|FALSE
15707|"causable by volition, and strives in vain, by various distortions of"|FALSE
15707|"countenance, to produce the next links, which are subject to association."|FALSE
15707|"See Class IV. 3. 1. 1."|FALSE
15707|"11. After our accomplished musician has acquired great variety of tunes and"|FALSE
15707|"songs, so that some of them begin to cease to be easily recollected, she"|FALSE
15707|"finds progressive trains of musical notes more frequently forgotten, than"|FALSE
15707|"those which are composed of reiterated circles, according with the eleventh"|FALSE
15707|"preceding article."|FALSE
15707|"12. To finish our example with the preceding articles we must at length"|FALSE
15707|"suppose, that our fair performer falls asleep over her harpsichord; and"|FALSE
15707|"thus by the suspension of volition, and the exclusion of external stimuli,"|FALSE
15707|"she dissevers the trains and circles of her musical exertions."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Many of these circumstances of catenations of motions receive an"|FALSE
15707|"easy explanation from the four following consequences to the seventh law of"|FALSE
15707|"animal causation in Sect. IV. These are, first, that those successions or"|FALSE
15707|"combinations of animal motions, whether they were united by causation,"|FALSE
15707|"association, or catenation, which have been most frequently repeated,"|FALSE
15707|"acquire the strongest connection. Secondly, that of these, those, which"|FALSE
15707|"have been less frequently mixed with other trains or tribes of motion, have"|FALSE
15707|"the strongest connection. Thirdly, that of these, those, which were first"|FALSE
15707|"formed, have the strongest connection. Fourthly, that if an animal motion"|FALSE
15707|"be excited by more than one causation, association, or catenation, at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time, it will be performed with greater energy."|FALSE
15707|"2. Hence also we understand, why the catenations of irritative motions are"|FALSE
15707|"more strongly connected than those of the other classes, where the quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of unmixed repetition has been equal; because they were first formed. Such"|FALSE
15707|"are those of the secerning and absorbent systems of vessels, where the"|FALSE
15707|"action of the gland produces a fluid, which stimulates the mouths of its"|FALSE
15707|"correspondent absorbents. The associated motions seem to be the next most"|FALSE
15707|"strongly united, from their frequent repetition; and where both these"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances unite, as in the vital motions, their catenations are"|FALSE
15707|"indissoluble but by the destruction of the animal."|FALSE
15707|"3. Where a new link has been introduced into a circle of actions by some"|FALSE
15707|"accidental defect of stimulus; if that defect of stimulus be repeated at"|FALSE
15707|"the same part of the circle a second or a third time, the defective motions"|FALSE
15707|"thus produced, both by the repeated defect of stimulus and by their"|FALSE
15707|"catenation with the parts of the circle of actions, will be performed with"|FALSE
15707|"less and less energy. Thus if any person is exposed to cold at a certain"|FALSE
15707|"hour to-day, so long as to render some part of the system for a time"|FALSE
15707|"torpid; and is again exposed to it at the same hour to-morrow, and the next"|FALSE
15707|"day; he will be more and more affected by it, till at length a cold fit of"|FALSE
15707|"fever is completely formed, as happens at the beginning of many of those"|FALSE
15707|"fevers, which are called nervous or low fevers. Where the patient has"|FALSE
15707|"slight periodical shiverings and paleness for many days before the febrile"|FALSE
15707|"paroxysm is completely formed."|FALSE
15707|"4. On the contrary, if the exposure to cold be for so short a time, as not"|FALSE
15707|"to induce any considerable degree of torpor or quiescence, and is repeated"|FALSE
15707|"daily as above mentioned, it loses its effect more and more at every"|FALSE
15707|"repetition, till the constitution can bear it without inconvenience, or"|FALSE
15707|"indeed without being conscious of it. As in walking into the cold air in"|FALSE
15707|"frosty weather. The same rule is applicable to increased stimulus, as of"|FALSE
15707|"heat, or of vinous spirit, within certain limits, as is applied in the two"|FALSE
15707|"last paragraphs to Deficient Stimulus; as is further explained in Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XXXVI. on the Periods of Diseases."|FALSE
15707|"5. Where irritation coincides with sensation to produce the same"|FALSE
15707|"catenations of motion, as in inflammatory fevers, they are excited with"|FALSE
15707|"still greater energy than by the irritation alone. So when children expect"|FALSE
15707|"to be tickled in play, by a feather lightly passed over the lips, or by"|FALSE
15707|"gently vellicating the soles of their feet, laughter is most vehemently"|FALSE
15707|"excited; though they can stimulate these parts with their own fingers"|FALSE
15707|"unmoved. Here the pleasureable idea of playfulness coincides with the"|FALSE
15707|"vellication; and there is no voluntary exertion used to diminish the"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, as there would be, if a child should endeavour to tickle"|FALSE
15707|"himself. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"6. And lastly, the motions excited by the junction of voluntary exertion"|FALSE
15707|"with irritation are performed with more energy, than those by irritation"|FALSE
15707|"singly; as when we listen to small noises, as to the ticking of a watch in"|FALSE
15707|"the night, we perceive the most weak sounds, that are at other times"|FALSE
15707|"unheeded. So when we attend to the irritative ideas of sound in our ears,"|FALSE
15707|"which are generally not attended to, we can hear them; and can see the"|FALSE
15707|"spectra of objects, which remain in the eye, whenever we please to exert"|FALSE
15707|"our voluntary power in aid of those weak actions of the retina, or of the"|FALSE
15707|"auditory nerve."|FALSE
15707|"7. The temporary catenations of ideas, which are caused by the sensations"|FALSE
15707|"of pleasure or pain, are easily dissevered either by irritations, as when a"|FALSE
15707|"sudden noise disturbs a day-dream; or by the power of volition, as when we"|FALSE
15707|"awake from sleep. Hence in our waking hours, whenever an idea occurs, which"|FALSE
15707|"is incongruous to our former experience, we instantly dissever the train of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination by the power of volition, and compare the incongruous idea with"|FALSE
15707|"our previous knowledge of nature, and reject it. This operation of the mind"|FALSE
15707|"has not yet acquired a specific name, though it is exerted every minute of"|FALSE
15707|"our waking hours; unless it may be termed INTUITIVE ANALOGY. It is an act"|FALSE
15707|"of reasoning of which we are unconscious except from its effects in"|FALSE
15707|"preserving the congruity of our ideas, and bears the same relation to the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power of volition, that irritative ideas, of which we are"|FALSE
15707|"inconscious except by their effects, do to the sensorial power of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation; as the former is produced by volition without our attention to"|FALSE
15707|"it, and the latter by irritation without our attention to them."|FALSE
15707|"If on the other hand a train of imagination or of voluntary ideas are"|FALSE
15707|"excited with great energy, and passing on with great vivacity, and become"|FALSE
15707|"dissevered by some violent stimulus, as the discharge of a pistol near"|FALSE
15707|"one's ear, another circumstance takes place, which is termed SURPRISE;"|FALSE
15707|"which by exciting violent irritation, and violent sensation, employs for a"|FALSE
15707|"time the whole sensorial energy, and thus dissevers the passing trains of"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, before the power of volition has time to compare them with the usual"|FALSE
15707|"phenomena of nature. In this case fear is generally the companion of"|FALSE
15707|"surprise, and adds to our embarrassment, as every one experiences in some"|FALSE
15707|"degree when he hears a noise in the dark, which he cannot instantly account"|FALSE
15707|"for. This catenation of fear with surprise is owing to our perpetual"|FALSE
15707|"experience of injuries from external bodies in motion, unless we are upon"|FALSE
15707|"our guard against them. See Sect. XVIII. 17. XIX. 2."|FALSE
15707|"Many other examples of the catenations of animal motions are explained in"|FALSE

15707|"1. There are four situations of our system, which in their moderate degrees"|FALSE
15707|"are not usually termed diseases, and yet abound with many very curious and"|FALSE
15707|"instructive phenomena; these are sleep, reverie, vertigo, drunkenness."|FALSE
15707|"These we shall previously consider, before we step forwards to develop the"|FALSE
15707|"causes and cures of diseases with the modes of the operation of medicines."|FALSE
15707|"As all those trains and tribes of animal motion, which are subjected to"|FALSE
15707|"volition, were the last that were caused, their connection is weaker than"|FALSE
15707|"that of the other classes; and there is a peculiar circumstance attending"|FALSE
15707|"this causation, which is, that it is entirely suspended during sleep;"|FALSE
15707|"whilst the other classes of motion, which are more immediately necessary to"|FALSE
15707|"life, as those caused by internal stimuli, for instance the pulsations of"|FALSE
15707|"the heart and arteries, or those catenated with pleasurable sensation, as"|FALSE
15707|"the powers of digestion, continue to strengthen their habits without"|FALSE
15707|"interruption. Thus though man in his sleeping state is a much less perfect"|FALSE
15707|"animal, than in his waking hours; and though he consumes more than one"|FALSE
15707|"third of his life in this his irrational situation; yet is the wisdom of"|FALSE
15707|"the Author of nature manifest even in this seeming imperfection of his"|FALSE
15707|"work!"|FALSE
15707|"The truth of this assertion with respect to the large muscles of the body,"|FALSE
15707|"which are concerned in locomotion, is evident; as no one in perfect sanity"|FALSE
15707|"walks about in his sleep, or performs any domestic offices: and in respect"|FALSE
15707|"to the mind, we never exercise our reason or recollection in dreams; we may"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes seem distracted between contending passions, but we never compare"|FALSE
15707|"their objects, or deliberate about the acquisition of those objects, if our"|FALSE
15707|"sleep is perfect. And though many synchronous tribes or successive trains"|FALSE
15707|"of ideas may represent the houses or walks, which have real existence, yet"|FALSE
15707|"are they here introduced by their connection with our sensations, and are"|FALSE
15707|"in truth ideas of imagination, not of recollection."|FALSE
15707|"2. For our sensations of pleasure and pain are experienced with great"|FALSE
15707|"vivacity in our dreams; and hence all that motley group of ideas, which are"|FALSE
15707|"caused by them, called the ideas of imagination, with their various"|FALSE
15707|"associated trains, are in a very vivid manner acted over in the sensorium;"|FALSE
15707|"and these sometimes call into action the larger muscles, which have been"|FALSE
15707|"much associated with them; as appears from the muttering sentences, which"|FALSE
15707|"some people utter in their dreams, and from the obscure barking of sleeping"|FALSE
15707|"dogs, and the motions of their feet and nostrils."|FALSE
15707|"This perpetual flow of the trains of ideas, which constitute our dreams,"|FALSE
15707|"and which are caused by painful or pleasurable sensation, might at first"|FALSE
15707|"view be conceived to be an useless expenditure of sensorial power. But it"|FALSE
15707|"has been shewn, that those motions, which are perpetually excited, as those"|FALSE
15707|"of the arterial system by the stimulus of the blood, are attended by a"|FALSE
15707|"great accumulation of sensorial power, after they have been for a time"|FALSE
15707|"suspended; as the hot-fit of fever is the consequence of the cold one. Now"|FALSE
15707|"as these trains of ideas caused by sensation are perpetually excited during"|FALSE
15707|"our waking hours, if they were to be suspended in sleep like the voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"motions, (which are exerted only by intervals during our waking hours,) an"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of sensorial power would follow; and on our awaking a delirium"|FALSE
15707|"would supervene, since these ideas caused by sensation would be produced"|FALSE
15707|"with such energy, that we should mistake the trains of imagination for"|FALSE
15707|"ideas excited by irritation; as perpetually happens to people debilitated"|FALSE
15707|"by fevers on their first awaking; for in these fevers with debility the"|FALSE
15707|"general quantity of irritation being diminished, that of sensation is"|FALSE
15707|"increased. In like manner if the actions of the stomach, intestines, and"|FALSE
15707|"various glands, which are perhaps in part at least caused by or catenated"|FALSE
15707|"with agreeable sensation, and which perpetually exist during our waking"|FALSE
15707|"hours, were like the voluntary motions suspended in our sleep; the great"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of sensorial power, which would necessarily follow, would be"|FALSE
15707|"liable to excite inflammation in them."|FALSE
15707|"3. When by our continued posture in sleep, some uneasy sensations are"|FALSE
15707|"produced, we either gradually awake by the exertion of volition, or the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles connected by habit with such sensations alter the position of the"|FALSE
15707|"body; but where the sleep is uncommonly profound, and those uneasy"|FALSE
15707|"sensations great, the disease called the incubus, or nightmare, is"|FALSE
15707|"produced. Here the desire of moving the body is painfully exerted, by the"|FALSE
15707|"power of moving it, or volition, is incapable of action, till we awake."|FALSE
15707|"Many less disagreeable struggles in our dreams, as when we wish in vain to"|FALSE
15707|"fly from terrifying objects, constitute a slighter degree of this disease."|FALSE
15707|"In awaking from the nightmare I have more than once observed, that there"|FALSE
15707|"was no disorder in my pulse; nor do I believe the respiration is laborious,"|FALSE
15707|"as some have affirmed. It occurs to people whose sleep is too profound, and"|FALSE
15707|"some disagreeable sensation exists, which at other times would have"|FALSE
15707|"awakened them, and have thence prevented the disease of nightmare; as after"|FALSE
15707|"great fatigue or hunger with too large a supper and wine, which occasion"|FALSE
15707|"our sleep to be uncommonly profound. See No. 14, of this Section."|FALSE
15707|"4. As the larger muscles of the body are much more frequently excited by"|FALSE
15707|"volition than by sensation, they are but seldom brought into action in our"|FALSE
15707|"sleep: but the ideas of the mind are by habit much more frequently"|FALSE
15707|"connected with sensation than with volition; and hence the ceaseless flow"|FALSE
15707|"of our ideas in dreams. Every one's experience will teach him this truth,"|FALSE
15707|"for we all daily exert much voluntary muscular motion: but few of mankind"|FALSE
15707|"can bear the fatigue of much voluntary thinking."|FALSE
15707|"5. A very curious circumstance attending these our sleeping imaginations"|FALSE
15707|"is, that we seem to receive them by the senses. The muscles, which are"|FALSE
15707|"subservient to the external organs of sense, are connected with volition,"|FALSE
15707|"and cease to act in sleep; hence the eyelids are closed, and the tympanum"|FALSE
15707|"of the ear relaxed; and it is probable a similarity of voluntary exertion"|FALSE
15707|"may be necessary for the perceptions of the other nerves of sense; for it"|FALSE
15707|"is observed that the papillæ of the tongue can be seen to become erected,"|FALSE
15707|"when we attempt to taste any thing extremely grateful. Hewson Exper."|FALSE
15707|"Enquir. V. 2. 186. Albini Annot. Acad. L. i. c. 15. Add to this, that the"|FALSE
15707|"immediate organs of sense have no objects to excite them in the darkness"|FALSE
15707|"and silence of the night, but their nerves of sense nevertheless continue"|FALSE
15707|"to possess their perfect activity subservient to all their numerous"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive connections. This vivacity of our nerves of sense during the time"|FALSE
15707|"of sleep is evinced by a circumstance, which almost every one must at some"|FALSE
15707|"time or other have experienced; that is, if we sleep in the daylight, and"|FALSE
15707|"endeavour to see some object in our dream, the light is exceedingly painful"|FALSE
15707|"to our eyes; and after repeated struggles we lament in our sleep, that we"|FALSE
15707|"cannot see it. In this case I apprehend the eyelid is in some degree opened"|FALSE
15707|"by the vehemence of our sensations; and, the iris being dilated, the optic"|FALSE
15707|"nerve shews as great or greater sensibility than in our waking hours. See"|FALSE
15707|"No. 15. of this Section."|FALSE
15707|"When we are forcibly waked at midnight from profound sleep, our eyes are"|FALSE
15707|"much dazzled with the light of the candle for a minute or two, after there"|FALSE
15707|"has been sufficient time allowed for the contraction of the iris; which is"|FALSE
15707|"owing to the accumulation of sensorial power in the organ of vision during"|FALSE
15707|"its state of less activity. But when we have dreamt much of visible"|FALSE
15707|"objects, this accumulation of sensorial power in the organ of vision is"|FALSE
15707|"lessened or prevented, and we awake in the morning without being dazzled"|FALSE
15707|"with the light, after the iris has had time to contract itself. This is a"|FALSE
15707|"matter of great curiosity, and may be thus tried by any one in the"|FALSE
15707|"day-light. Close your eyes, and cover them with your hat; think for a"|FALSE
15707|"minute on a tune, which you are accustomed to, and endeavour to sing it"|FALSE
15707|"with as little activity of mind as possible. Suddenly uncover and open your"|FALSE
15707|"eyes, and in one second of time the iris will contract itself, but you will"|FALSE
15707|"perceive the day more luminous for several seconds, owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of sensorial power in the optic nerve."|FALSE
15707|"Then again close and cover your eyes, and think intensely on a cube of"|FALSE
15707|"ivory two inches diameter, attending first to the north and south sides of"|FALSE
15707|"it, and then to the other four sides of it; then get a clear image in your"|FALSE
15707|"mind's eye of all the sides of the same cube coloured red; and then of it"|FALSE
15707|"coloured green; and then of it coloured blue; lastly, open your eyes as in"|FALSE
15707|"the former experiment, and after the first second of time allowed for the"|FALSE
15707|"contraction of the iris, you will not perceive any increase of the light of"|FALSE
15707|"the day, or dazzling; because now there is no accumulation of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power in the optic nerve; that having been expended by its action in"|FALSE
15707|"thinking over visible objects."|FALSE
15707|"This experiment is not easy to be made at first, but by a few patient"|FALSE
15707|"trials the fact appears very certain; and shews clearly, that our ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination are repetitions of the motions of the nerve, which were"|FALSE
15707|"originally occasioned by the stimulus of external bodies; because they"|FALSE
15707|"equally expend the sensorial power in the organ of sense. See Sect. III. 4."|FALSE
15707|"which is analogous to our being as much fatigued by thinking as by labour."|FALSE
15707|"6. Nor is it in our dreams alone, but even in our waking reveries, and in"|FALSE
15707|"great efforts of invention, so great is the vivacity of our ideas, that we"|FALSE
15707|"do not for a time distinguish them from the real presence of substantial"|FALSE
15707|"objects; though the external organs of sense are open, and surrounded with"|FALSE
15707|"their usual stimuli. Thus whilst I am thinking over the beautiful valley,"|FALSE
15707|"through which I yesterday travelled, I do not perceive the furniture of my"|FALSE
15707|"room: and there are some, whose waking imaginations are so apt to run into"|FALSE
15707|"perfect reverie, that in their common attention to a favourite idea they do"|FALSE
15707|"not hear the voice of the companion, who accosts them, unless it is"|FALSE
15707|"repeated with unusual energy."|FALSE
15707|"This perpetual mistake in dreams and reveries, where our ideas of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination are attended with a belief of the presence of external objects,"|FALSE
15707|"evinces beyond a doubt, that all our ideas are repetitions of the motions"|FALSE
15707|"of the nerves of sense, by which they were acquired; and that this belief"|FALSE
15707|"is not, as some late philosophers contend, an instinct necessarily"|FALSE
15707|"connected only with our perceptions."|FALSE
15707|"7. A curious question demands our attention in this place; as we do not"|FALSE
15707|"distinguish in our dreams and reveries between our perceptions of external"|FALSE
15707|"objects, and our ideas of them in their absence, how do we distinguish them"|FALSE
15707|"at any time? In a dream, if the sweetness of sugar occurs to my"|FALSE
15707|"imagination, the whiteness and hardness of it, which were ideas usually"|FALSE
15707|"connected with the sweetness, immediately follow in the train; and I"|FALSE
15707|"believe a material lump of sugar present before my senses: but in my waking"|FALSE
15707|"hours, if the sweetness occurs to my imagination, the stimulus of the table"|FALSE
15707|"to my hand, or of the window to my eye, prevents the other ideas of the"|FALSE
15707|"hardness and whiteness of the sugar from succeeding; and hence I perceive"|FALSE
15707|"the fallacy, and disbelieve the existence of objects correspondent to those"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, whose tribes or trains are broken by the stimulus of other objects."|FALSE
15707|"And further in our waking hours, we frequently exert our volition in"|FALSE
15707|"comparing present appearances with such, as we have usually observed; and"|FALSE
15707|"thus correct the errors of one sense by our general knowledge of nature by"|FALSE
15707|"intuitive analogy. See Sect. XVII. 3. 7. Whereas in dreams the power of"|FALSE
15707|"volition is suspended, we can recollect and compare our present ideas with"|FALSE
15707|"none of our acquired knowledge, and are hence incapable of observing any"|FALSE
15707|"absurdities in them."|FALSE
15707|"By this criterion we distinguish our waking from our sleeping hours, we can"|FALSE
15707|"voluntarily recollect our sleeping ideas, when we are awake, and compare"|FALSE
15707|"them with our waking ones; but we cannot in our sleep _voluntarily_"|FALSE
15707|"recollect our waking ideas at all."|FALSE
15707|"8. The vast variety of scenery, novelty of combination, and distinctness of"|FALSE
15707|"imagery, are other curious circumstances of our sleeping imaginations. The"|FALSE
15707|"variety of scenery seems to arise from the superior activity and excellence"|FALSE
15707|"of our sense of vision; which in an instant unfolds to the mind extensive"|FALSE
15707|"fields of pleasurable ideas; while the other senses collect their objects"|FALSE
15707|"slowly, and with little combination; add to this, that the ideas, which"|FALSE
15707|"this organ presents us with, are more frequently connected with our"|FALSE
15707|"sensation than those of any other."|FALSE
15707|"9. The great novelty of combination is owing to another circumstance; the"|FALSE
15707|"trains of ideas, which are carried on in our waking thoughts, are in our"|FALSE
15707|"dreams dissevered in a thousand places by the suspension of volition, and"|FALSE
15707|"the absence of irritative ideas, and are hence perpetually falling into new"|FALSE
15707|"catenations. As explained in Sect. XVII. 1. 9. For the power of volition is"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually exerted during our waking hours in comparing our passing trains"|FALSE
15707|"of ideas with our acquired knowledge of nature, and thus forms many"|FALSE
15707|"intermediate links in their catenation. And the irritative ideas excited by"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus of the objects, with which we are surrounded, are every moment"|FALSE
15707|"intruded upon us, and form other links of our unceasing catenations of"|FALSE
15707|"ideas."|FALSE
15707|"10. The absence of the stimuli of external bodies, and of volition, in our"|FALSE
15707|"dreams renders the organs of sense liable to be more strongly affected by"|FALSE
15707|"the powers of sensation, and of association. For our desires or aversions,"|FALSE
15707|"or the obtrusions of surrounding bodies, dissever the sensitive and"|FALSE
15707|"associate tribes of ideas in our waking hours by introducing those of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation and volition amongst them. Hence proceeds the superior"|FALSE
15707|"distinctness of pleasurable or painful imagery in our sleep; for we recal"|FALSE
15707|"the figure and the features of a long lost friend, whom we loved, in our"|FALSE
15707|"dreams with much more accuracy and vivacity than in our waking thoughts."|FALSE
15707|"This circumstance contributes to prove, that our ideas of imagination are"|FALSE
15707|"reiterations of those motions of our organs of sense, which were excited by"|FALSE
15707|"external objects; because while we are exposed to the stimuli of present"|FALSE
15707|"objects, our ideas of absent objects cannot be so distinctly formed."|FALSE
15707|"11. The rapidity of the succession of transactions in our dreams is almost"|FALSE
15707|"inconceivable; insomuch that, when we are accidentally awakened by the"|FALSE
15707|"jarring of a door, which is opened into our bed-chamber, we sometimes dream"|FALSE
15707|"a whole history of thieves or fire in the very instant of awaking."|FALSE
15707|"During the suspension of volition we cannot compare our other ideas with"|FALSE
15707|"those of the parts of time in which they exist; that is, we cannot compare"|FALSE
15707|"the imaginary scene, which is before us, with those changes of it, which"|FALSE
15707|"precede or follow it: because this act of comparing requires recollection"|FALSE
15707|"or voluntary exertion. Whereas in our waking hours, we are perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"making this comparison, and by that means our waking ideas are kept"|FALSE
15707|"confident with each other by intuitive analogy; but this companion retards"|FALSE
15707|"the succession of them, by occasioning their repetition. Add to this, that"|FALSE
15707|"the transactions of our dreams consist chiefly of visible ideas, and that a"|FALSE
15707|"whole history of thieves and fire may be _beheld_ in an instant of time"|FALSE
15707|"like the figures in a picture."|FALSE
15707|"12. From this incapacity of attending to the parts of time in our dreams,"|FALSE
15707|"arises our ignorance of the length of the night; which, but from our"|FALSE
15707|"constant experience to the contrary, we should conclude was but a few"|FALSE
15707|"minutes, when our sleep is perfect. The same happens in our reveries; thus"|FALSE
15707|"when we are possessed with vehement joy, grief, or anger, time appears"|FALSE
15707|"short, for we exert no volition to compare the present scenery with the"|FALSE
15707|"past or future; but when we are compelled to perform those exercises of"|FALSE
15707|"mind or body, which, are unmixed with passion, as in travelling over a"|FALSE
15707|"dreary country, time appears long; for our desire to finish our journey"|FALSE
15707|"occasions us more frequently to compare our present situation with the"|FALSE
15707|"parts of time or place, which are before and behind us."|FALSE
15707|"So when we are enveloped in deep contemplation of any kind, or in reverie,"|FALSE
15707|"as in reading a very interesting play or romance, we measure time very"|FALSE
15707|"inaccurately; and hence, if a play greatly affects our passions, the"|FALSE
15707|"absurdities of passing over many days or years, and or perpetual changes of"|FALSE
15707|"place, are not perceived by the audience; as is experienced by every one,"|FALSE
15707|"who reads or sees some plays of the immortal Shakespear; but it is"|FALSE
15707|"necessary for inferior authors to observe those rules of the [Greek:"|FALSE
15707|"pithanon] and [Greek: prepon] inculcated by Aristotle, because their works"|FALSE
15707|"do not interest the passions sufficiently to produce complete reverie."|FALSE
15707|"Those works, however, whether a romance or a sermon, which do not interest"|FALSE
15707|"us so much as to induce reverie, may nevertheless incline us to sleep. For"|FALSE
15707|"those pleasurable ideas, which are presented to us, and are too gentle to"|FALSE
15707|"excite laughter, (which is attended with interrupted voluntary exertions,"|FALSE
15707|"as explained Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.) and which are not accompanied with any"|FALSE
15707|"other emotion, which usually excites some voluntary exertion, as anger, or"|FALSE
15707|"fear, are liable to produce sleep; which consists in a suspension of all"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary power. But if the ideas thus presented to us, and interest our"|FALSE
15707|"attention, are accompanied with so much pleasurable or painful sensation as"|FALSE
15707|"to excite our voluntary exertion at the same time, reverie is the"|FALSE
15707|"consequence. Hence an interesting play produces reverie, a tedious one"|FALSE
15707|"produces sleep: in the latter we become exhausted by attention, and are not"|FALSE
15707|"excited to any voluntary exertion, and therefore sleep; in the former we"|FALSE
15707|"are excited by some emotion, which prevents by its pain the suspension of"|FALSE
15707|"volition, and in as much as it interests us, induces reverie, as explained"|FALSE
15707|"in the next Section."|FALSE
15707|"But when our sleep is imperfect, as when we have determined to rise in half"|FALSE
15707|"an hour, time appears longer to us than in most other situations. Here our"|FALSE
15707|"solicitude not to oversleep the determined time induces us in this"|FALSE
15707|"imperfect sleep to compare the quick changes of imagined scenery with the"|FALSE
15707|"parts of time or place, they would have taken up, had they real exigence;"|FALSE
15707|"and that more frequently than in our waking hours; and hence the time"|FALSE
15707|"appears longer to us: and I make no doubt, but the permitted time appears"|FALSE
15707|"long to a man going to the gallows, as the fear of its quick lapse will"|FALSE
15707|"make him think frequently about it."|FALSE
15707|"13. As we gain our knowledge of time by comparing the present scenery with"|FALSE
15707|"the past and future, and of place by comparing the situations of objects"|FALSE
15707|"with each other; so we gain our idea of consciousness by comparing"|FALSE
15707|"ourselves with the scenery around us; and of identity by comparing our"|FALSE
15707|"present consciousness with our past consciousness: as we never think of"|FALSE
15707|"time or place, but when we make the companions above mentioned, so we never"|FALSE
15707|"think of consciousness, but when we compare our own existence with that of"|FALSE
15707|"other objects; nor of identity, but when we compare our present and our"|FALSE
15707|"past consciousness. Hence the consciousness of our own existence, and of"|FALSE
15707|"our identity, is owing to a voluntary exertion of our minds: and on that"|FALSE
15707|"account in our complete dreams we neither measure time, are surprised at"|FALSE
15707|"the sudden changes of place, nor attend to our own existence, or identity;"|FALSE
15707|"because our power of volition is suspended. But all these circumstances are"|FALSE
15707|"more or less observable in our incomplete ones; for then we attend a little"|FALSE
15707|"to the lapse of time, and the changes of place, and to our own existence;"|FALSE
15707|"and even to our identity of person; for a lady seldom dreams, that she is a"|FALSE
15707|"soldier; nor a man, that he is brought to bed."|FALSE
15707|"14. As long as our sensations only excite their sensual motions, or ideas,"|FALSE
15707|"our sleep continues sound; but as soon as they excite desires or aversions,"|FALSE
15707|"our sleep becomes imperfect; and when that desire or aversion is so strong,"|FALSE
15707|"as to produce voluntary motions, we begin to awake; the larger muscles of"|FALSE
15707|"the body are brought into action to remove that irritation or sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"which a continued posture has caused; we stretch our limbs, and yawn, and"|FALSE
15707|"our sleep is thus broken by the accumulation of voluntary power."|FALSE
15707|"Sometimes it happens, that the act of waking is suddenly produced, and this"|FALSE
15707|"soon after the commencement of sleep; which is occasioned by some sensation"|FALSE
15707|"so disagreeable, as instantaneously to excite the power of volition; and a"|FALSE
15707|"temporary action of all the voluntary motions suddenly succeeds, and we"|FALSE
15707|"start awake. This is sometimes accompanied with loud noise in the ears, and"|FALSE
15707|"with some degree of fear; and when it is in great excess, so as to produce"|FALSE
15707|"continued convulsive motions of those muscles, which are generally"|FALSE
15707|"subservient to volition, it becomes epilepsy: the fits of which in some"|FALSE
15707|"patients generally commence during sleep. This differs from the night-mare"|FALSE
15707|"described in No. 3. of this Section, because in that the disagreeable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation is not so great as to excite the power of volition into action;"|FALSE
15707|"for as soon as that happens, the disease ceases."|FALSE
15707|"Another circumstance, which sometimes awakes people soon after the"|FALSE
15707|"commencement of their sleep, is where the voluntary power is already so"|FALSE
15707|"great in quantity as almost to prevent them from falling asleep, and then a"|FALSE
15707|"little accumulation of it soon again awakens them; this happens in cases of"|FALSE
15707|"insanity, or where the mind has been lately much agitated by fear or anger."|FALSE
15707|"There is another circumstance in which sleep is likewise of short duration,"|FALSE
15707|"which arises from great debility, as after great over-fatigue, and in some"|FALSE
15707|"fevers, where the strength of the patient is greatly diminished, as in"|FALSE
15707|"these cases the pulse intermits or flutters, and the respiration is"|FALSE
15707|"previously affected, it seems to originate from the want of some voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"efforts to facilitate respiration, as when we are awake. And is further"|FALSE
15707|"treated of in Vol. II. Class I. 2. 1. 2. on the Diseases of the Voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"Power. Art. Somnus interruptus."|FALSE
15707|"15. We come now to those motions which depend on irritation. The motions of"|FALSE
15707|"the arterial and glandular systems continue in our sleep, proceeding slower"|FALSE
15707|"indeed, but stronger and more uniformly, than in our waking hours, when"|FALSE
15707|"they are incommoded by external stimuli, or by the movements of volition;"|FALSE
15707|"the motions of the muscles subservient to respiration continue to be"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated into action, and the other internal senses of hunger, thirst,"|FALSE
15707|"and lust, are not only occasionally excited in our sleep, but their"|FALSE
15707|"irritative motions are succeeded by their usual sensations, and make a part"|FALSE
15707|"of the farrago of our dreams. These sensations of the want of air, of"|FALSE
15707|"hunger, thirst, and lust, in our dreams, contribute to prove, that the"|FALSE
15707|"nerves of the external senses are also alive and excitable in our sleep;"|FALSE
15707|"but as the stimuli of external objects are either excluded from them by the"|FALSE
15707|"darkness and silence of the night, or their access to them is prevented by"|FALSE
15707|"the suspension of volition, these nerves of sense fall more readily into"|FALSE
15707|"their connexions with sensation and with association; because much"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power, which during the day was expended in moving the external"|FALSE
15707|"organs of sense in consequence of irritation from external stimuli, or in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of volition, becomes now in some degree accumulated, and"|FALSE
15707|"renders the internal or immediate organs of sense more easily excitable by"|FALSE
15707|"the other sensorial powers. Thus in respect to the eye, the irritation from"|FALSE
15707|"external stimuli, and the power of volition during our waking hours,"|FALSE
15707|"elevate the eye-lids, adapt the aperture of the iris to the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"light, the focus of the crystalline humour, and the angle of the optic"|FALSE
15707|"axises to the distance of the object, all which perpetual activity during"|FALSE
15707|"the day expends much sensorial power, which is saved during our sleep."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, that not only those parts of the system, which are always"|FALSE
15707|"excited by internal stimuli, as the stomach, intestinal canal, bile-ducts,"|FALSE
15707|"and the various glands, but the organs of sense also may be more violently"|FALSE
15707|"excited into action by the irritation from internal stimuli, or by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, during our sleep than in our waking hours; because during the"|FALSE
15707|"suspension of volition, there is a greater quantity of the spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"animation to be expended by the other sensorial powers. On this account our"|FALSE
15707|"irritability to internal stimuli, and our sensibility to pain or pleasure,"|FALSE
15707|"is not only greater in sleep, but increases as our sleep is prolonged."|FALSE
15707|"Whence digestion and secretion are performed better in sleep, than in our"|FALSE
15707|"waking hours, and our dreams in the morning have greater variety and"|FALSE
15707|"vivacity, as our sensibility increases, than at night when we first lie"|FALSE
15707|"down. And hence epileptic fits, which are always occasioned by some"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation, so frequently attack those, who are subject to"|FALSE
15707|"them, in their sleep; because at this time the system is more excitable by"|FALSE
15707|"painful sensation in consequence of internal stimuli; and the power of"|FALSE
15707|"volition is then suddenly exerted to relieve this pain, as explained Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XXXIV. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"There is a disease, which frequently affects children in the cradle, which"|FALSE
15707|"is termed ecstasy, and seems to consist in certain exertions to relieve"|FALSE
15707|"painful sensation, in which the voluntary power is not so far excited as"|FALSE
15707|"totally to awaken them, and yet is sufficient to remove the disagreeable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, which excites it; in this case changing the posture of the child"|FALSE
15707|"frequently relieves it."|FALSE
15707|"I have at this time under my care an elegant young man about twenty-two"|FALSE
15707|"years of age, who seldom sleeps more than an hour without experiencing a"|FALSE
15707|"convulsion fit; which ceases in about half a minute without any subsequent"|FALSE
15707|"stupor. Large doses of opium only prevented the paroxysms, so long as they"|FALSE
15707|"prevented him from sleeping by the intoxication, which they induced. Other"|FALSE
15707|"medicines had no effect on him. He was gently awakened every half hour for"|FALSE
15707|"one night, but without good effect, as he soon slept again, and the fit"|FALSE
15707|"returned at about the same periods of time, for the accumulated sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, which occasioned the increased sensibility to pain, was not thus"|FALSE
15707|"exhausted. This case evinces, that the sensibility of the system to"|FALSE
15707|"internal excitation increases, as our sleep is prolonged; till the pain"|FALSE
15707|"thus occasioned produces voluntary exertion; which, when it is in its usual"|FALSE
15707|"degree, only awakens us; but when it is more violent, it occasions"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions."|FALSE
15707|"The cramp in the calf of the leg is another kind of convulsion, which"|FALSE
15707|"generally commences in sleep, occasioned by the continual increase of"|FALSE
15707|"irritability from internal stimuli, or of sensibility, during that state of"|FALSE
15707|"our existence. The cramp is a violent exertion to relieve pain, generally"|FALSE
15707|"either of the skin from cold, or of the bowels, as in some diarrhoeas, or"|FALSE
15707|"from the muscles having been previously overstretched, as in walking up or"|FALSE
15707|"down steep hills. But in these convulsions of the muscles, which form the"|FALSE
15707|"calf of the leg, the contraction is so violent as to occasion another pain"|FALSE
15707|"in consequence of their own too violent contraction; as soon as the"|FALSE
15707|"original pain, which caused the contraction, is removed. And hence the"|FALSE
15707|"cramp, or spasm, of these muscles is continued without intermission by this"|FALSE
15707|"new pain, unlike the alternate convulsions and remissions in epileptic"|FALSE
15707|"fits. The reason, that the contraction of these muscles of the calf of the"|FALSE
15707|"leg is more violent during their convulsion than that of others, depends on"|FALSE
15707|"the weakness of their antagonist muscles; for after these have been"|FALSE
15707|"contracted in their usual action, as at every step in walking, they are"|FALSE
15707|"again extended, not, as most other muscles are, by their antagonists, but"|FALSE
15707|"by the weight of the whole body on the balls of the toes; and that weight"|FALSE
15707|"applied to great mechanical advantage on the heel, that is, on the other"|FALSE
15707|"end of the bone of the foot, which thus acts as a lever."|FALSE
15707|"Another disease, the periods of which generally commence during our sleep,"|FALSE
15707|"is the asthma. Whatever may be the remote cause of paroxysms of asthma, the"|FALSE
15707|"immediate cause of the convulsive respiration, whether in the common"|FALSE
15707|"asthma, or in what is termed the convulsive asthma, which are perhaps only"|FALSE
15707|"different degrees of the same disease, must be owing to violent voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"exertions to relieve pain, as in other convulsions; and the increase of"|FALSE
15707|"irritability to internal stimuli, or of sensibility, during sleep must"|FALSE
15707|"occasion them to commence at this time."|FALSE
15707|"Debilitated people, who have been unfortunately accustomed to great"|FALSE
15707|"ingurgitation of spirituous potation, frequently part with a great quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of water during the night, but with not more than usual in the day-time."|FALSE
15707|"This is owing to a beginning torpor of the absorbent system, and precedes"|FALSE
15707|"anasarca, which commences in the day, but is cured in the night by the"|FALSE
15707|"increase of the irritability of the absorbent system during sleep, which"|FALSE
15707|"thus imbibes from the cellular membrane the fluids, which had been"|FALSE
15707|"accumulated there during the day; though it is possible the horizontal"|FALSE
15707|"position of the body may contribute something to this purpose, and also the"|FALSE
15707|"greater irritability of some branches of the absorbent vessels, which open"|FALSE
15707|"their mouths in the cells of the cellular membrane, than that of other"|FALSE
15707|"branches."|FALSE
15707|"As soon as a person begins to sleep, the irritability and sensibility of"|FALSE
15707|"the system begins to increase, owing to the suspension of volition and the"|FALSE
15707|"exclusion of external stimuli. Hence the actions of the vessels in"|FALSE
15707|"obedience to internal stimulation become stronger and more energetic,"|FALSE
15707|"though less frequent in respect to number. And as many of the secretions"|FALSE
15707|"are increased, so the heat of the system is gradually increased, and the"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of feeble people, which had been cold during the day, become"|FALSE
15707|"warm. Till towards morning many people become so warm, as to find it"|FALSE
15707|"necessary to throw off some of their bed-clothes, as soon as they awake;"|FALSE
15707|"and in others sweats are so liable to occur towards morning during their"|FALSE
15707|"sleep."|FALSE
15707|"Thus those, who are not accustomed to sleep in the open air, are very"|FALSE
15707|"liable to take cold, if they happen to fall asleep on a garden bench, or in"|FALSE
15707|"a carriage with the window open. For as the system is warmer during sleep,"|FALSE
15707|"as above explained, if a current of cold air affects any part of the body,"|FALSE
15707|"a torpor of that part is more effectually produced, as when a cold blast of"|FALSE
15707|"air through a key-hole or casement falls upon a person in a warm room. In"|FALSE
15707|"those cases the affected part possesses less irritability in respect to"|FALSE
15707|"heat, from its having previously been exposed to a greater stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"heat, as in the warm room, or during sleep; and hence, when the stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"heat is diminished, a torpor is liable to ensue; that is, we take cold."|FALSE
15707|"Hence people who sleep in the open air, generally feel chilly both at the"|FALSE
15707|"approach of sleep, and on their awaking; and hence many people are"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually subject to catarrhs if they sleep in a less warm head-dress,"|FALSE
15707|"than that which they wear in the day."|FALSE
15707|"16. Not only the sensorial powers of irritation and of sensation, but that"|FALSE
15707|"of association also appear to act with greater vigour during the suspension"|FALSE
15707|"of volition in sleep. It will be shewn in another place, that the gout"|FALSE
15707|"generally first attacks the liver, and that afterwards an inflammation of"|FALSE
15707|"the ball of the great toe commences by association, and that of the liver"|FALSE
15707|"ceases. Now as this change or metastasis of the activity of the system"|FALSE
15707|"generally commences in sleep, it follows, that these associations of motion"|FALSE
15707|"exist with greater energy at that time; that is, that the sensorial faculty"|FALSE
15707|"of association, like those of irritation and of sensation, becomes in some"|FALSE
15707|"measure accumulated during the suspension of volition."|FALSE
15707|"Other associate tribes and trains of motions, as well as the irritative and"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive ones, appear to be increased in their activity during the"|FALSE
15707|"suspension of volition in sleep. As those which contribute to circulate the"|FALSE
15707|"blood, and to perform the various secretions; as well as the associate"|FALSE
15707|"tribes and trains of ideas, which contribute to furnish the perpetual"|FALSE
15707|"dreams of our dreaming imaginations."|FALSE
15707|"In sleep the secretions have generally been supposed to be diminished, as"|FALSE
15707|"the expectorated mucus in coughs, the fluids discharged in diarrhoeas, and"|FALSE
15707|"in salivation, except indeed the secretion of sweat, which is often visibly"|FALSE
15707|"increased. This error seems to have arisen from attention to the excretions"|FALSE
15707|"rather than to the secretions. For the secretions, except that of sweat,"|FALSE
15707|"are generally received into reservoirs, as the urine into the bladder, and"|FALSE
15707|"the mucus of the intestines and lungs into their respective cavities; but"|FALSE
15707|"these reservoirs do not exclude these fluids immediately by their stimulus,"|FALSE
15707|"but require at the same time some voluntary efforts, and therefore permit"|FALSE
15707|"them to remain during sleep. And as they thus continue longer in those"|FALSE
15707|"receptacles in our sleeping hours, a greater part is absorbed from them,"|FALSE
15707|"and the remainder becomes thicker, and sometimes in less quantity, though"|FALSE
15707|"at the time it was secreted the fluid was in greater quantity than in our"|FALSE
15707|"waking hours. Thus the urine is higher coloured after long sleep; which"|FALSE
15707|"shews that a greater quantity has been secreted, and that more of the"|FALSE
15707|"aqueous and saline part has been reabsorbed, and the earthy part left in"|FALSE
15707|"the bladder; hence thick urine in fevers shews only a greater action of the"|FALSE
15707|"vessels which secrete it in the kidneys, and of those which absorb it from"|FALSE
15707|"the bladder."|FALSE
15707|"The same happens to the mucus expectorated in coughs, which is thus"|FALSE
15707|"thickened by absorption of its aqueous and saline parts; and the same of"|FALSE
15707|"the feces of the intestines. From hence it appears, and from what has been"|FALSE
15707|"said in No. 15. of this Section concerning the increase of irritability and"|FALSE
15707|"of sensibility during sleep, that the secretions are in general rather"|FALSE
15707|"increased than diminished during these hours of our existence; and it is"|FALSE
15707|"probable that nutrition is almost entirely performed in sleep; and that"|FALSE
15707|"young animals grow more at this time than in their waking hours, as young"|FALSE
15707|"plants have long since been observed to grow more in the night, which is"|FALSE
15707|"their time of sleep."|FALSE
15707|"17. Two other remarkable circumstances of our dreaming ideas are their"|FALSE
15707|"inconsistency, and the total absence of surprise. Thus we seem to be"|FALSE
15707|"present at more extraordinary metamorphoses of animals or trees, than are"|FALSE
15707|"to be met with in the fables of antiquity; and appear to be transported"|FALSE
15707|"from place to place, which seas divide, as quickly as the changes of"|FALSE
15707|"scenery are performed in a play-house; and yet are not sensible of their"|FALSE
15707|"inconsistency, nor in the least degree affected with surprise."|FALSE
15707|"We must consider this circumstance more minutely. In our waking trains of"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, those that are inconsistent with the usual order of nature, so"|FALSE
15707|"rarely have occurred to us, that their connexion is the slightest of all"|FALSE
15707|"others: hence, when a consistent train of ideas is exhausted, we attend to"|FALSE
15707|"the external stimuli, that usually surround us, rather than to any"|FALSE
15707|"inconsistent idea, which might otherwise present itself; and if an"|FALSE
15707|"inconsistent idea should intrude itself, we immediately compare it with the"|FALSE
15707|"preceding one, and voluntarily reject the train it would introduce; this"|FALSE
15707|"appears further in the Section on Reverie, in which state of the mind"|FALSE
15707|"external stimuli are not attended to, and yet the streams of ideas are kept"|FALSE
15707|"consistent by the efforts of volition. But as our faculty of volition is"|FALSE
15707|"suspended, and all external stimuli are excluded in sleep, this slighter"|FALSE
15707|"connexion of ideas takes place; and the train is said to be inconsistent;"|FALSE
15707|"that is, dissimilar to the usual order of nature."|FALSE
15707|"But, when any consistent train of sensitive or voluntary ideas is flowing"|FALSE
15707|"along, if any external stimulus affects us so violently, as to intrude"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas forcibly into the mind, it disunites the former train of"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, and we are affected with surprise. These stimuli of unusual energy"|FALSE
15707|"or novelty not only disunite our common trains of ideas, but the trains of"|FALSE
15707|"muscular motions also, which have not been long established by habit, and"|FALSE
15707|"disturb those that have. Some people become motionless by great surprise,"|FALSE
15707|"the fits of hiccup and or ague have been often removed by it, and it even"|FALSE
15707|"affects the movements of the heart, and arteries; but in our sleep, all"|FALSE
15707|"external stimuli are excluded, and in consequence no surprise can exist."|FALSE
15707|"See Section XVII. 3. 7."|FALSE
15707|"18. We frequently awake with pleasure from a dream, which has delighted us,"|FALSE
15707|"without being able to recollect the transactions of it; unless perhaps at a"|FALSE
15707|"distance of time, some analogous idea may introduce afresh this forgotten"|FALSE
15707|"train: and in our waking reveries we sometimes in a moment lose the train"|FALSE
15707|"of thought, but continue to feel the glow of pleasure, or the depression of"|FALSE
15707|"spirits, it occasioned: whilst at other times we can retrace with ease"|FALSE
15707|"these histories of our reveries and dreams."|FALSE
15707|"The above explanation of surprise throws light upon this subject. When we"|FALSE
15707|"are suddenly awaked by any violent stimulus, the surprise totally disunites"|FALSE
15707|"the trains of our sleeping ideas from these of our waking ones; but if we"|FALSE
15707|"gradually awake, this does not happen; and we readily unravel the preceding"|FALSE
15707|"trains of imagination."|FALSE
15707|"19. There are various degrees of surprise; the more intent we are upon the"|FALSE
15707|"train of ideas, which we are employed about, the more violent must be the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus that interrupts them, and the greater is the degree of surprise. I"|FALSE
15707|"have observed dogs, who have slept by the fire, and by their obscure"|FALSE
15707|"barking and struggling have appeared very intent on their prey, that shewed"|FALSE
15707|"great surprise for a few seconds after their awaking by looking eagerly"|FALSE
15707|"around them; which they did not do at other times of waking. And an"|FALSE
15707|"intelligent friend of mine has remarked, that his lady, who frequently"|FALSE
15707|"speaks much and articulately in her sleep, could never recollect her dreams"|FALSE
15707|"in the morning, when this happened to her: but that when she did not speak"|FALSE
15707|"in her sleep, she could always recollect them."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, when our sensations act so strongly in sleep as to influence the"|FALSE
15707|"larger muscles, as in those, who talk or struggle in their dreams; or in"|FALSE
15707|"those, who are affected with complete reverie (as described in the next"|FALSE
15707|"Section), great surprise is produced, when they awake; and these as well as"|FALSE
15707|"those, who are completely drunk or delirious, totally forget afterwards"|FALSE
15707|"their imaginations at those times."|FALSE
15707|"20. As the immediate cause of sleep consists in the suspension of volition,"|FALSE
15707|"it follows, that whatever diminishes the general quantity of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, or derives it from the faculty of volition, will constitute a remote"|FALSE
15707|"cause of sleep; such as fatigue from muscular or mental exertion, which"|FALSE
15707|"diminishes the general quantity of sensorial power; or an increase of the"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive motions, as by attending to soft music, which diverts the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power from the faculty of volition; or lastly, by increase of the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative motions, as by wine, or food; or warmth; which not only by their"|FALSE
15707|"expenditure of sensorial power diminish the quantity of volition; but also"|FALSE
15707|"by their producing pleasureable sensations (which occasion other muscular"|FALSE
15707|"or sensual motions in consequence), doubly decrease the voluntary power,"|FALSE
15707|"and thus more forcibly produce sleep. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"Another method of inducing sleep is delivered in a very ingenious work"|FALSE
15707|"lately published by Dr. Beddoes. Who, after lamenting that opium frequently"|FALSE
15707|"occasions restlessness, thinks, \"that in most cases it would be better to"|FALSE
15707|"induce sleep by the abstraction of stimuli, than by exhausting the"|FALSE
15707|"excitability;\" and adds, \"upon this principle we could not have a better"|FALSE
15707|"soporific than an atmosphere with a diminished proportion of oxygene air,"|FALSE
15707|"and that common air might be admitted after the patient was asleep.\""|FALSE
15707|"(Observ. on Calculus, &c. by Dr. Beddoes, Murray.) If it should be found to"|FALSE
15707|"be true, that the excitability of the system depends on the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"oxygene absorbed by the lungs in respiration according to the theory of Dr."|FALSE
15707|"Beddoes, and of M. Girtanner, this idea of sleeping in an atmosphere with"|FALSE
15707|"less oxygene in its composition might be of great service in epileptic"|FALSE
15707|"cases, and in cramp, and even in fits of the asthma, where their periods"|FALSE
15707|"commence from the increase of irritability during sleep."|FALSE
15707|"Sleep is likewise said to be induced by mechanic pressure on the brain in"|FALSE
15707|"the cases of spina bifida. Where there has been a defect of one of the"|FALSE
15707|"vertebræ of the back, a tumour is protruded in consequence; and, whenever"|FALSE
15707|"this tumour has been compressed by the hand, sleep is said to be induced,"|FALSE
15707|"because the whole of the brain both within the head and spine becomes"|FALSE
15707|"compressed by the retrocession of the fluid within the tumour. But by what"|FALSE
15707|"means a compression of the brain induces sleep has not been explained, but"|FALSE
15707|"probably by diminishing the secretion of sensorial power, and then the"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary motions become suspended previously to the irritative ones, as"|FALSE
15707|"occurs in most dying persons."|FALSE
15707|"Another way of procuring sleep mechanically was related to me by Mr."|FALSE
15707|"Brindley, the famous canal engineer, who was brought up to the business of"|FALSE
15707|"a mill-wright; he told me, that he had more than once seen the experiment"|FALSE
15707|"of a man extending himself across the large stone of a corn-mill, and that"|FALSE
15707|"by gradually letting the stone whirl, the man fell asleep, before the stone"|FALSE
15707|"had gained its full velocity, and he supposed would have died without pain"|FALSE
15707|"by the continuance or increase of the motion. In this case the centrifugal"|FALSE
15707|"motion of the head and feet must accumulate the blood in both those"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of the body, and thus compress the brain."|FALSE
15707|"Lastly, we should mention the application of cold; which, when in a less"|FALSE
15707|"degree, produces watchfulness by the pain it occasions, and the tremulous"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions of the subcutaneous muscles; but when it is applied in great"|FALSE
15707|"degree, is said to produce sleep. To explain this effect it has been said,"|FALSE
15707|"that as the vessels of the skin and extremities become first torpid by the"|FALSE
15707|"want of the stimulus of heat, and as thence less blood is circulated"|FALSE
15707|"through them, as appears from their paleness, a greater quantity of blood"|FALSE
15707|"poured upon the brain produces sleep by its compression of that organ. But"|FALSE
15707|"I should rather imagine, that the sensorial power becomes exhausted by the"|FALSE
15707|"convulsive actions in consequence of the pain of cold, and of the voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"exercise previously used to prevent it, and that the sleep is only the"|FALSE
15707|"beginning to die, as the suspension of voluntary power in lingering deaths"|FALSE
15707|"precedes for many hours the extinction of the irritative motions."|FALSE
15707|"21. The following are the characteristic circumstances attending perfect"|FALSE
15707|"sleep."|FALSE
15707|"1. The power of volition is totally suspended."|FALSE
15707|"2. The trains of ideas caused by sensation proceed with greater facility"|FALSE
15707|"and vivacity; but become inconsistent with the usual order of nature. The"|FALSE
15707|"muscular motions caused by sensation continue; as those concerned in our"|FALSE
15707|"evacuations during infancy, and afterwards in digestion, and in priapismus."|FALSE
15707|"3. The irritative muscular motions continue, as those concerned in the"|FALSE
15707|"circulation, in secretion, in respiration. But the irritative sensual"|FALSE
15707|"motions, or ideas, are not excited; as the immediate organs of sense are"|FALSE
15707|"not stimulated into action by external objects, which are excluded by the"|FALSE
15707|"external organs of sense; which are not in sleep adapted to their reception"|FALSE
15707|"by the power of volition, as in our waking hours."|FALSE
15707|"4. The associate motions continue; but their first link is not excited into"|FALSE
15707|"action by volition, or by external stimuli. In all respects, except those"|FALSE
15707|"above mentioned, the three last sensorial powers are somewhat increased in"|FALSE
15707|"energy during the suspension of volition, owing to the consequent"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of the spirit of animation."|FALSE

15707|"this interesting train of ideas becomes exhausted, or the appulses of"|FALSE
15707|"external objects are applied with unusual violence, and we return with"|FALSE
15707|"surprise, or with regret, into the common track of life. This is termed"|FALSE
15707|"reverie or studium."|FALSE
15707|"In some constitutions these reveries continue a considerable time, and are"|FALSE
15707|"not to be removed without greater difficulty, but are experienced in a less"|FALSE

15707|"reverie to so great a degree, that it becomes a formidable disease; the"|FALSE

15707|"Transactions. I shall here subjoin an account of such a case, with its"|FALSE
15707|"cure, for the better illustration of this subject."|FALSE
15707|"A very ingenious and elegant young lady, with light eyes and hair, about"|FALSE
15707|"the age of seventeen, in other respects well, was suddenly seized soon"|FALSE
15707|"after her usual menstruation with this very wonderful malady. The disease"|FALSE
15707|"began with vehement convulsions of almost every muscle of her body, with"|FALSE
15707|"great but vain efforts to vomit, and the most violent hiccoughs, that can"|FALSE
15707|"be conceived: these were succeeded in about an hour with a fixed spasm; in"|FALSE
15707|"which one hand was applied to her head, and the other to support it: in"|FALSE
15707|"about half an hour these ceased, and the reverie began suddenly, and was at"|FALSE
15707|"first manifest by the look of her eyes and countenance, which seemed to"|FALSE
15707|"express attention. Then she conversed aloud with imaginary persons with her"|FALSE
15707|"eyes open, and could not for about an hour be brought to attend to the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of external objects by any kind of violence, which it was proper"|FALSE
15707|"to use; these symptoms returned in this order every day for five or six"|FALSE
15707|"weeks."|FALSE
15707|"These conversations were quite consistent, and we could understand, what"|FALSE
15707|"she supposed her imaginary companions to answer, by the continuation of her"|FALSE

15707|"it; when she came to the forgotten word, it was shouted aloud in her ear,"|FALSE
15707|"and this repeatedly, to no purpose; but by many trials she at length"|FALSE
15707|"regained it herself."|FALSE
15707|"These paroxysms were terminated with the appearance of inexpressible"|FALSE
15707|"surprise, and great fear, from which she was some minutes in recovering"|FALSE
15707|"herself, calling on her sister with great agitation, and very frequently"|FALSE
15707|"underwent a repetition of convulsions, apparently from the pain of fear."|FALSE
15707|"See Sect. XVII. 3. 7."|FALSE
15707|"After having thus returned for about an hour every day for two or three"|FALSE
15707|"weeks, the reveries seemed to become less complete, and some of their"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances varied; so that she could walk about the room in them without"|FALSE
15707|"running against any of the furniture; though these motions were at first"|FALSE
15707|"very unsteady and tottering. And afterwards she once drank a dish of tea,"|FALSE
15707|"when the whole apparatus of the tea-table was set before her; and expressed"|FALSE
15707|"some suspicion, that a medicine was put into it, and once seemed to smell"|FALSE
15707|"of a tuberose, which was in flower in her chamber, and deliberated aloud"|FALSE
15707|"about breaking it from the stem, saying, \"it would make her sister so"|FALSE
15707|"charmingly angry.\" At another time in her melancholy moments she heard the"|FALSE
15707|"sound of a passing bell, \"I wish I was dead,\" she cried, listening to the"|FALSE
15707|"bell, and then taking off one of her shoes, as she sat upon the bed, \"I"|FALSE
15707|"love the colour black,\" says she, \"a little wider, and a little longer,"|FALSE
15707|"even this might make me a coffin!\"--Yet it is evident, she was not sensible"|FALSE
15707|"at this time, any more than formerly, of seeing or hearing any person about"|FALSE
15707|"her; indeed when great light was thrown upon her by opening the shutters of"|FALSE
15707|"the window, her trains of ideas seemed less melancholy; and when I have"|FALSE
15707|"forcibly held her hands, or covered her eyes, she appeared to grow"|FALSE
15707|"impatient, and would say, she could not tell what to do, for she could"|FALSE
15707|"neither see nor move. In all these circumstances her pulse continued"|FALSE
15707|"unaffected as in health. And when the paroxysm was over, she could never"|FALSE
15707|"recollect a single idea of what had passed in it."|FALSE
15707|"This astonishing disease, after the use of many other medicines and"|FALSE
15707|"applications in vain, was cured by very large doses of opium given about an"|FALSE
15707|"hour before the expected returns of the paroxysms; and after a few"|FALSE
15707|"relapses, at the intervals of three or four months, entirely disappeared."|FALSE
15707|"But she continued at times to have other symptoms of epilepsy."|FALSE
15707|"3. We shall only here consider, what happened during the time of her"|FALSE
15707|"reveries, as that is our present subject; the fits of convulsion belong to"|FALSE
15707|"another part of this treatise. Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"There seems to have been no suspension of volition during the fits of"|FALSE
15707|"reverie, because she endeavoured to regain the lost idea in repeating the"|FALSE
15707|"lines of poetry, and deliberated about breaking the tuberose, and suspected"|FALSE
15707|"the tea to have been medicated."|FALSE
15707|"4. The ideas and muscular movements depending on sensation were exerted"|FALSE
15707|"with their usual vivacity, and were kept from being inconsistent by the"|FALSE
15707|"power of volition, as appeared from her whole conversation, and was"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XVII. 3. 7. and XVIII. 16."|FALSE
15707|"5. The ideas and motions dependant on irritation during the first weeks of"|FALSE
15707|"her disease, whilst the reverie was complete, were never succeeded by the"|FALSE
15707|"sensation of pleasure or pain; as she neither saw, heard, nor felt any of"|FALSE
15707|"the surrounding objects. Nor was it certain that any irritative motions"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded the stimulus of external objects, till the reverie became less"|FALSE
15707|"complete, and then she could walk about the room without running against"|FALSE
15707|"the furniture of it. Afterwards, when the reverie became still less"|FALSE
15707|"complete from the use of opium, some few irritations were at times"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded by her attention to them. As when she smelt at a tuberose, and"|FALSE
15707|"drank a dish of tea, but this only when she seemed voluntarily to attend to"|FALSE
15707|"them."|FALSE
15707|"6. In common life when we listen to distant sounds, or wish to distinguish"|FALSE
15707|"objects in the night, we are obliged strongly to exert our volition to"|FALSE
15707|"dispose the organs of sense to perceive them, and to suppress the other"|FALSE
15707|"trains of ideas, which might interrupt these feeble sensations. Hence in"|FALSE
15707|"the present history the strongest stimuli were not perceived, except when"|FALSE
15707|"the faculty of volition was exerted on the organ of sense; and then even"|FALSE
15707|"common stimuli were sometimes perceived: for her mind was so strenuously"|FALSE
15707|"employed in pursuing its own trains of voluntary or sensitive ideas, that"|FALSE
15707|"no common stimuli could so far excite her attention as to disunite them;"|FALSE
15707|"that is, the quantity of volition or of sensation already existing was"|FALSE
15707|"greater than any, which could be produced in consequence of common degrees"|FALSE
15707|"of stimulation. But the few stimuli of the tuberose, and of the tea, which"|FALSE
15707|"she did perceive, were such, as accidentally coincided with the trains of"|FALSE
15707|"thought, which were passing in her mind; and hence did not disunite those"|FALSE
15707|"trains, and create surprise. And their being perceived at all was owing to"|FALSE
15707|"the power of volition preceding or coinciding with that of irritation."|FALSE
15707|"This explication is countenanced by a fact mentioned concerning a"|FALSE
15707|"somnambulist in the Lausanne Transactions, who sometimes opened his eyes"|FALSE
15707|"for a short time to examine, where he was, or where his ink-pot stood, and"|FALSE
15707|"then shut them again, dipping his pen into the pot every now and then, and"|FALSE
15707|"writing on, but never opening his eyes afterwards, although he wrote on"|FALSE
15707|"from line to line regularly, and corrected some errors of the pen, or in"|FALSE
15707|"spelling: so much easier was it to him to refer to his ideas of the"|FALSE
15707|"positions of things, than to his perceptions of them."|FALSE
15707|"7. The associated motions persisted in their usual channel, as appeared by"|FALSE
15707|"the combinations of her ideas, and the use of her muscles, and the equality"|FALSE
15707|"of her pulse; for the natural motions of the arterial system, though"|FALSE
15707|"originally excited like other motions by stimulus, seem in part to continue"|FALSE
15707|"by their association with each other. As the heart of a viper pulsates long"|FALSE
15707|"after it is cut out of the body, and removed from the stimulus of the"|FALSE
15707|"blood."|FALSE
15707|"8. In the section on sleep, it was observed that the nerves of sense are"|FALSE
15707|"equally alive and susceptible to irritation in that state, as when we are"|FALSE
15707|"awake; but that they are secluded from stimulating objects, or rendered"|FALSE
15707|"unfit to receive them: but in complete reverie the reverse happens, the"|FALSE
15707|"immediate organs of sense are exposed to their usual stimuli; but are"|FALSE
15707|"either not excited into action at all, or not into so great action, as to"|FALSE
15707|"produce attention or sensation."|FALSE
15707|"The total forgetfulness of what passes in reveries; and the surprise on"|FALSE
15707|"recovering from them, are explained in Section XVIII. 19. and in Section"|FALSE
15707|"XVII. 3. 7."|FALSE
15707|"9. It appears from hence, that reverie is a disease of the epileptic or"|FALSE
15707|"cataleptic kind, since the paroxysms of this young lady always began and"|FALSE
15707|"frequently terminated with convulsions; and though in its greatest degree"|FALSE
15707|"it has been called somnambulation, or sleep-walking, it is totally"|FALSE
15707|"different from sleep; because the essential character of sleep consists in"|FALSE
15707|"the total suspension of volition, which in reverie is not affected; and the"|FALSE
15707|"essential character of reverie consists not in the absence of those"|FALSE
15707|"irritative motions of our senses, which are occasioned by the stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"external objects, but in their never being productive of sensation. So that"|FALSE
15707|"during a fit of reverie that strange event happens to the whole system of"|FALSE
15707|"nerves, which occurs only to some particular branches of them in those, who"|FALSE
15707|"are a second time exposed to the action of contagious matter. If the matter"|FALSE
15707|"of the small-pox be inserted into the arm of one, who has previously had"|FALSE
15707|"that disease, it will stimulate the wound, but the general sensation or"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation of the system does not follow, which constitutes the disease."|FALSE
15707|"See Sect. XII. 3. 6. XXXIII. 2. 8."|FALSE
15707|"10. The following is the definition or character of complete reverie. 1."|FALSE
15707|"The irritative motions occasioned by internal stimuli continue, those from"|FALSE
15707|"the stimuli of external objects are either not produced at all, or are"|FALSE
15707|"never succeeded by sensation or attention, unless they are at the same time"|FALSE
15707|"excited by volition. 2. The sensitive motions continue, and are kept"|FALSE
15707|"consistent by the power of volition. 3. The voluntary motions continue"|FALSE
15707|"undisturbed. 4. The associate motions continue undisturbed."|FALSE
15707|"Two other cases of reverie are related in Section XXXIV. 3. which further"|FALSE
15707|"evince, that reverie is an effort of the mind to relieve some painful"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, and is hence allied to convulsion, and to insanity. Another case"|FALSE
15707|"is related in Class III. 1. 2. 2."|FALSE

15707|"1. In learning to walk we judge of the distances of the objects, which we"|FALSE
15707|"approach, by the eye; and by observing their perpendicularity determine our"|FALSE
15707|"own. This circumstance not having been attended to by the writers on"|FALSE
15707|"vision, the disease called vertigo or dizziness has been little understood."|FALSE
15707|"When any person loses the power of muscular action, whether he is erect or"|FALSE
15707|"in a sitting posture, he sinks down upon the ground; as is seen in fainting"|FALSE
15707|"fits, and other instances of great debility. Hence it follows, that some"|FALSE
15707|"exertion of muscular power is necessary to preserve our perpendicular"|FALSE
15707|"attitude. This is performed by proportionally exerting the antagonist"|FALSE
15707|"muscles of the trunk, neck, and limbs; and if at any time in our"|FALSE
15707|"locomotions we find ourselves inclining to one side, we either restore our"|FALSE
15707|"equilibrium by the efforts of the muscles on the other side, or by moving"|FALSE
15707|"one of our feet extend the base, which we rest upon, to the new center of"|FALSE
15707|"gravity."|FALSE
15707|"But the most easy and habitual manner of determining our want of"|FALSE
15707|"perpendicularity, is by attending to the apparent motion of the objects"|FALSE
15707|"within the sphere of distinct vision; for this apparent motion of objects,"|FALSE
15707|"when we incline from our perpendicularity, or begin to fall, is as much"|FALSE
15707|"greater than the real motion of the eye, as the diameter of the sphere of"|FALSE
15707|"distinct vision is to our perpendicular height."|FALSE
15707|"Hence no one, who is hood-winked, can walk in a straight line for a hundred"|FALSE
15707|"steps together; for he inclines so greatly, before he is warned of his want"|FALSE
15707|"of perpendicularity by the sense of touch, not having the apparent motions"|FALSE
15707|"of ambient objects to measure this inclination by, that he is necessitated"|FALSE
15707|"to move one of his feet outwards, to the right or to the left, to support"|FALSE
15707|"the new centre of gravity, and thus errs from the line he endeavours to"|FALSE
15707|"proceed in."|FALSE
15707|"For the same reason many people become dizzy, when they look from the"|FALSE
15707|"summit of a tower, which is raised much above all other objects, as these"|FALSE
15707|"objects are out of the sphere of distinct vision, and they are obliged to"|FALSE
15707|"balance their bodies by the less accurate feelings of their muscles."|FALSE
15707|"There is another curious phenomenon belonging to this place, if the"|FALSE
15707|"circumjacent visible objects are so small, that we do not distinguish their"|FALSE
15707|"minute parts; or so similar, that we do not know them from each other; we"|FALSE
15707|"cannot determine our perpendicularity by them. Thus in a room hung with a"|FALSE
15707|"paper, which is coloured over with similar small black lozenges or"|FALSE
15707|"rhomboids, many people become dizzy; for when they begin to fall, the next"|FALSE
15707|"and the next lozenge succeeds upon the eye; which they mistake for the"|FALSE
15707|"first, and are not aware, that they have any apparent motion. But if you"|FALSE
15707|"fix a sheet of paper, or draw any other figure, in the midst of these"|FALSE
15707|"lozenges, the charm ceases, and no dizziness is perceptible.--The same"|FALSE
15707|"occurs, when we ride over a plain covered with snow without trees or other"|FALSE
15707|"eminent objects."|FALSE
15707|"2. But after having compared visible objects at rest with the sense of"|FALSE
15707|"touch, and learnt to distinguish their shapes and shades, and to measure"|FALSE
15707|"our want of perpendicularity by their apparent motions, we come to consider"|FALSE
15707|"them in real motion. Here a new difficulty occurs, and we require some"|FALSE
15707|"experience to learn the peculiar mode of motion of any moving objects,"|FALSE
15707|"before we can make use of them for the purposes of determining our"|FALSE
15707|"perpendicularity. Thus some people become dizzy at the sight of a whirling"|FALSE
15707|"wheel, or by gazing on the fluctuations of a river, if no steady objects"|FALSE
15707|"are at the same time within the sphere of their distinct vision; and when a"|FALSE
15707|"child first can stand erect upon his legs, if you gain his attention to a"|FALSE
15707|"white handkerchief steadily extended like a sail, and afterwards make it"|FALSE
15707|"undulate, he instantly loses his perpendicularity, and tumbles on the"|FALSE
15707|"ground."|FALSE
15707|"3. A second difficulty we have to encounter is to distinguish our own real"|FALSE
15707|"movements from the apparent motions of objects. Our daily practice of"|FALSE
15707|"walking and riding on horseback soon instructs us with accuracy to discern"|FALSE
15707|"these modes of motion, and to ascribe the apparent motions of the ambient"|FALSE
15707|"objects to ourselves; but those, which we have not acquired by repeated"|FALSE
15707|"habit, continue to confound us. So as we ride on horseback the trees and"|FALSE
15707|"cottages, which occur to us, appear at rest; we can measure their distances"|FALSE
15707|"with our eye, and regulate our attitude by them; yet if we carelessly"|FALSE
15707|"attend to distant hills or woods through a thin hedge, which is near us, we"|FALSE
15707|"observe the jumping and progressive motions of them; as this is increased"|FALSE
15707|"by the paralax of these objects; which we have not habituated ourselves to"|FALSE
15707|"attend to. When first an European mounts an elephant sixteen feet high, and"|FALSE
15707|"whose mode of motion he is not accustomed to, the objects seem to undulate,"|FALSE
15707|"as he passes, and he frequently becomes sick and vertiginous, as I am well"|FALSE
15707|"informed. Any other unusual movement of our bodies has the same effect, as"|FALSE
15707|"riding backwards in a coach, swinging on a rope, turning round swiftly on"|FALSE
15707|"one leg, scating on the ice, and a thousand others. So after a patient has"|FALSE
15707|"been long confined to his bed, when he first attempts to walk, he finds"|FALSE
15707|"himself vertiginous, and is obliged by practice to learn again the"|FALSE
15707|"particular modes of the apparent motions of objects, as he walks by them."|FALSE
15707|"4. A third difficulty, which occurs to us in learning to balance ourselves"|FALSE
15707|"by the eye, is, when both ourselves and the circumjacent objects are in"|FALSE
15707|"real motion. Here it is necessary, that we should be habituated to both"|FALSE
15707|"these modes of motion in order to preserve our perpendicularity. Thus on"|FALSE
15707|"horseback we accurately observe another person, whom we meet, trotting"|FALSE
15707|"towards us, without confounding his jumping and progressive motion with our"|FALSE
15707|"own, because we have been accustomed to them both; that is, to undergo the"|FALSE
15707|"one, and to see the other at the same time. But in riding over a broad and"|FALSE
15707|"fluctuating stream, though we are well experienced in the motions of our"|FALSE
15707|"horse, we are liable to become dizzy from our inexperience in that of the"|FALSE
15707|"water. And when first we go on ship-board, where the movements of"|FALSE
15707|"ourselves, and the movements of the large waves are both new to us, the"|FALSE
15707|"vertigo is almost unavoidable with the terrible sickness, which attends it."|FALSE
15707|"And this I have been assured has happened to several from being removed"|FALSE
15707|"from a large ship into a small one; and again from a small one into a man"|FALSE
15707|"of war."|FALSE
15707|"5. From the foregoing examples it is evident, that, when we are surrounded"|FALSE
15707|"with unusual motions, we lose our perpendicularity: but there are some"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar circumstances attending this effect of moving objects, which we"|FALSE
15707|"come now to mention, and shall hope from the recital of them to gain some"|FALSE
15707|"insight into the manner of their production."|FALSE
15707|"When a child moves round quick upon one foot, the circumjacent objects"|FALSE
15707|"become quite indistinct, as their distance increases their apparent"|FALSE
15707|"motions; and this great velocity confounds both their forms, and their"|FALSE
15707|"colours, as is seen in whirling round a many coloured wheel; he then loses"|FALSE
15707|"his usual method of balancing himself by vision, and begins to stagger, and"|FALSE
15707|"attempts to recover himself by his muscular feelings. This staggering adds"|FALSE
15707|"to the instability of the visible objects by giving a vibratory motion"|FALSE
15707|"besides their rotatory one. The child then drops upon the ground, and the"|FALSE
15707|"neighbouring objects seem to continue for some seconds of time to circulate"|FALSE
15707|"around him, and the earth under him appears to librate like a balance. In"|FALSE
15707|"some seconds of time these sensations of a continuation of the motion of"|FALSE
15707|"objects vanish; but if he continues turning round somewhat longer, before"|FALSE
15707|"he falls, sickness and vomiting are very liable to succeed. But none of"|FALSE
15707|"these circumstances affect those who have habituated themselves to this"|FALSE
15707|"kind of motion, as the dervises in Turkey, amongst whom these swift"|FALSE
15707|"gyrations are a ceremony of religion."|FALSE
15707|"In an open boat passing from Leith to Kinghorn in Scotland, a sudden change"|FALSE
15707|"of the wind shook the undistended sail, and stopt our boat; from this"|FALSE
15707|"unusual movement the passengers all vomited except myself. I observed, that"|FALSE
15707|"the undulation of the ship, and the instability of all visible objects,"|FALSE
15707|"inclined me strongly to be sick; and this continued or increased, when I"|FALSE
15707|"closed my eyes, but as often as I bent my attention with energy on the"|FALSE
15707|"management and mechanism of the ropes and sails, the sickness ceased; and"|FALSE
15707|"recurred again, as often as I relaxed this attention; and I am assured by a"|FALSE
15707|"gentleman of observation and veracity, that he has more than once observed,"|FALSE
15707|"when the vessel has been in immediate danger, that the sea-sickness of the"|FALSE
15707|"passengers has instantaneously ceased, and recurred again, when the danger"|FALSE
15707|"was over."|FALSE
15707|"Those, who have been upon the water in a boat or ship so long, that they"|FALSE
15707|"have acquired the necessary habits of motion upon that unstable element, at"|FALSE
15707|"their return on land frequently think in their reveries, or between"|FALSE
15707|"sleeping and waking, that they observe the room, they sit in, or some of"|FALSE
15707|"its furniture, to librate like the motion of the vessel. This I have"|FALSE
15707|"experienced myself, and have been told, that after long voyages, it is some"|FALSE
15707|"time before these ideas entirely vanish. The same is observable in a less"|FALSE
15707|"degree after having travelled some days in a stage coach, and particularly"|FALSE
15707|"when we lie down in bed, and compose ourselves to sleep; in this case it is"|FALSE
15707|"observable, that the rattling noise of the coach, as well as the undulatory"|FALSE
15707|"motion, haunts us. The drunken vertigo, and the vulgar custom of rocking"|FALSE
15707|"children, will be considered in the next Section."|FALSE
15707|"6. The motions, which are produced by the power of volition, may be"|FALSE
15707|"immediately stopped by the exertion of the same power on the antagonist"|FALSE
15707|"muscles; otherwise these with all the other classes of motion continue to"|FALSE
15707|"go on, some time after they are excited, as the palpitation of the heart"|FALSE
15707|"continues after the object of fear, which occasioned it, is removed. But"|FALSE
15707|"this circumstance is in no class of motions more remarkable than in those"|FALSE
15707|"dependent on irritation; thus if any one looks at the sun, and then covers"|FALSE
15707|"his eyes with his hand, he will for many seconds of time, perceive the"|FALSE
15707|"image of the sun marked on his retina: a similar image of all other visible"|FALSE
15707|"objects would remain some time formed on the retina, but is extinguished by"|FALSE
15707|"the perpetual change of the motions of this nerve in our attention to other"|FALSE
15707|"objects. To this must be added, that the longer time any movements have"|FALSE
15707|"continued to be excited without fatigue to the organ, the longer will they"|FALSE
15707|"continue spontaneously, after the excitement is withdrawn: as the taste of"|FALSE
15707|"tobacco in the mouth after a person has been smoaking it."|FALSE
15707|"This taste remains so strong, that if a person continues to draw air"|FALSE
15707|"through a tobacco pipe in the dark, after having been smoking some time, he"|FALSE
15707|"cannot distinguish whether his pipe be lighted or not."|FALSE
15707|"From these two considerations it appears, that the dizziness felt in the"|FALSE
15707|"head, after seeing objects in unusual motion, is no other than a"|FALSE
15707|"continuation of the motions of the optic nerve excited by those objects and"|FALSE
15707|"which engage our attention. Thus on turning round on one foot, the vertigo"|FALSE
15707|"continues for some seconds of time after the person is fallen on the"|FALSE
15707|"ground; and the longer he has continued to revolve, the longer will"|FALSE
15707|"continue these successive motions of the parts of the optic nerve."|FALSE

15707|"    with your eyes closed, and open them immediately at the time of your"|FALSE
15707|"    ceasing to turn; and even during the whole time of revolving, as may be"|FALSE
15707|"    felt by your hand pressed lightly on your closed eyelids. To these"|FALSE
15707|"    movements of the eyes, of which he supposes the observer to be"|FALSE
15707|"    inconscious, Dr. Wells ascribes the apparent circumgyration of objects"|FALSE
15707|"    on ceasing to revolve."|FALSE
15707|"    The cause of thus turning our eyes forwards, and then back again, after"|FALSE
15707|"    our body is at rest, depends, I imagine, on the same circumstance,"|FALSE
15707|"    which induces us to follow the indistinct spectra, which are formed on"|FALSE
15707|"    one side of the center of the retina, when we observe them apparently"|FALSE
15707|"    on clouds, as described in Sect. XL. 2. 2.; and then not being able to"|FALSE
15707|"    gain a more distinct vision of them, we turn our eyes back, and again"|FALSE
15707|"    and again pursue the flying shade."|FALSE
15707|"    But this rolling of the eyes, after revolving till we become"|FALSE
15707|"    vertiginous, cannot cause the apparent circumgyration of objects, in a"|FALSE
15707|"    direction contrary to that in which we have been revolving, for the"|FALSE
15707|"    following reasons. 1. Because in pursuing a spectrum in the sky, or on"|FALSE
15707|"    the ground, as above mentioned, we perceive no retrograde motions of"|FALSE
15707|"    objects. 2. Because the apparent retrograde motions of objects, when we"|FALSE
15707|"    have revolved till we are vertiginous, continues much longer than the"|FALSE
15707|"    rolling of the eyes above described."|FALSE
15707|"    3. When we have revolved from right to left, the apparent motion of"|FALSE
15707|"    objects, when we stop, is from left to right; and when we have revolved"|FALSE
15707|"    from left to right, the apparent circulation of objects is from right"|FALSE
15707|"    to left; yet in both these cases the eyes of the revolver are seen"|FALSE
15707|"    equally to roll forwards and backwards."|FALSE
15707|"    4. Because this rolling of the eyes backwards and forwards takes place"|FALSE
15707|"    during our revolving, as may be perceived by the hand lightly pressed"|FALSE
15707|"    on the closed eyelids, and therefore exists before the effect ascribed"|FALSE
15707|"    to it."|FALSE
15707|"    And fifthly, I now come to relate an experiment, in which the rolling"|FALSE
15707|"    of the eyes does not take place at all after revolving, and yet the"|FALSE
15707|"    vertigo is more distressing than in the situations above mentioned. If"|FALSE
15707|"    any one looks steadily at a spot in the ceiling over his head, or"|FALSE
15707|"    indeed at his own finger held up high over his head, and in that"|FALSE
15707|"    situation turns round till he becomes giddy; and then stops, and looks"|FALSE
15707|"    horizontally; he now finds, that the apparent rotation of objects is"|FALSE
15707|"    from above downwards, or from below upwards; that is, that the apparent"|FALSE
15707|"    circulation of objects is now vertical instead of horizontal, making"|FALSE
15707|"    part of a circle round the axis of his _eye_; and this without any"|FALSE
15707|"    rolling of his eyeballs. The reason of there being no rolling of the"|FALSE
15707|"    eyeballs, perceived after this experiment, is, because the images of"|FALSE
15707|"    objects are formed in rotation round the axis of the eye, and not from"|FALSE
15707|"    one side to the other of the axis of it; so that, as the eyeball has"|FALSE
15707|"    not power to turn in its socket round its own axis, it cannot follow"|FALSE
15707|"    the apparent motions of these evanescent spectra, either before or"|FALSE
15707|"    after the body is at rest. From all which arguments it is manifest,"|FALSE
15707|"    that these apparent retrograde gyrations of objects are not caused by"|FALSE
15707|"    the rolling of the eyeballs; first, because no apparent retrogression"|FALSE
15707|"    of objects is observed in other rollings of the eyes: secondly, because"|FALSE
15707|"    the apparent retrogression of objects continues many seconds after the"|FALSE
15707|"    rolling of the eyeballs ceases. Thirdly, because the apparent"|FALSE
15707|"    retrogression of objects is sometimes one way, and sometimes another,"|FALSE
15707|"    yet the rolling of the eyeballs is the same. Fourthly, because the"|FALSE
15707|"    rolling of the eyeballs exists before the apparent retrograde motions"|FALSE
15707|"    of objects is observed; that is, before the revolving person stops. And"|FALSE
15707|"    fifthly, because the apparent retrograde gyration of objects is"|FALSE
15707|"    produced, when there is no rolling of the eyeballs at all."|FALSE
15707|"    Doctor Wells imagines, that no spectra can be gained in the eye, if a"|FALSE
15707|"    person revolves with his eyelids closed, and thinks this a sufficient"|FALSE
15707|"    argument against the opinion, that the apparent progression of the"|FALSE
15707|"    spectra of light or colours in the eye can cause the apparent"|FALSE
15707|"    retrogression of objects in the vertigo above described; but it is"|FALSE
15707|"    certain, when any person revolves in a light room with his eyes closed,"|FALSE
15707|"    that he nevertheless perceives differences of light both in quantity"|FALSE
15707|"    and colour through his eyelids, as he turns round; and readily gains"|FALSE
15707|"    spectra of those differences. And these spectra are not very different"|FALSE
15707|"    except in vivacity from those, which he acquires, when he revolves with"|FALSE
15707|"    unclosed eyes, since if he then revolves very rapidly the colours and"|FALSE
15707|"    forms of surrounding objects are as it were mixed together in his eye;."|FALSE
15707|"    as when, the prismatic colours are painted on a wheel, they appear"|FALSE
15707|"    white as they revolve. The truth of this is evinced by the staggering"|FALSE
15707|"    or vertigo of men perfectly blind, when they turn round; which is not"|FALSE
15707|"    attended with apparent circulation of objects, but is a vertiginous"|FALSE
15707|"    disorder of the sense of touch. Blind men balance themselves by their"|FALSE
15707|"    sense of touch; which, being less adapted for perceiving small"|FALSE
15707|"    deviations from their perpendicular, occasions them to carry themselves"|FALSE
15707|"    more erect in walking. This method of balancing themselves by the"|FALSE
15707|"    direction of their pressure against the floor, becomes disordered by"|FALSE
15707|"    the unusual mode of action in turning round, and they begin to lose"|FALSE
15707|"    their perpendicularity, that is, they become vertiginous; but without"|FALSE
15707|"    any apparent circular motions of visible objects."|FALSE
15707|"    It will appear from the following experiments, that the apparent"|FALSE
15707|"    progression of the ocular spectra of light or colours is the cause of"|FALSE
15707|"    the apparent retrogression of objects, after a person has revolved,"|FALSE
15707|"    till he is vertiginous."|FALSE
15707|"    First, when a person turns round in a light room with his eyes open,"|FALSE
15707|"    but closes them before he stops, he will seem to be carried forwards in"|FALSE
15707|"    the direction he was turning for a short time after he stops. But if he"|FALSE
15707|"    opens his eyes again, the objects before him instantly appear to move"|FALSE
15707|"    in a retrograde direction, and he loses the sensation of being carried"|FALSE
15707|"    forwards. The same occurs if a person revolves in a light room with his"|FALSE
15707|"    eyes closed; when he stops, he seems to be for a time carried forwards,"|FALSE
15707|"    if his eyes are still closed; but the instant he opens them, the"|FALSE
15707|"    surrounding objects appear to move in retrograde gyration. From hence"|FALSE
15707|"    it may be concluded, that it is the sensation or imagination of our"|FALSE
15707|"    continuing to go forwards in the direction in which we were turning,"|FALSE
15707|"    that causes the apparent retrograde circulation of objects."|FALSE
15707|"    Secondly, though there is an audible vertigo, as is known by the"|FALSE
15707|"    battement, or undulations of sound in the ears, which many vertiginous"|FALSE
15707|"    people experience; and though there is also a tangible vertigo, as when"|FALSE
15707|"    a blind person turns round, as mentioned above; yet as this"|FALSE
15707|"    circumgyration of objects is an hallucination or deception of the sense"|FALSE
15707|"    of sight, we are to look for the cause of our appearing to move"|FALSE
15707|"    forward, when we stop with our eyes closed after gyration, to some"|FALSE
15707|"    affection of this sense. Now, thirdly, if the spectra formed in the eye"|FALSE
15707|"    during our rotation, continue to change, when we stand still, like the"|FALSE
15707|"    spectra described in Sect. III. 3. 6. such changes must suggest to us"|FALSE
15707|"    the idea or sensation of our still continuing to turn round; as is the"|FALSE
15707|"    case, when we revolve in a light room, and close our eyes before we"|FALSE
15707|"    stop. And lastly, on opening our eyes in the situation above described,"|FALSE
15707|"    the objects we chance to view amid these changing spectra in the eye,"|FALSE
15707|"    must seem to move in a contrary direction; as the moon sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"    appears to move retrograde, when swift-gliding clouds are passing"|FALSE
15707|"    forwards so much nearer the eye of the beholder."|FALSE
15707|"    To make observations on faint ocular spectra requires some degree of"|FALSE
15707|"    habit, and composure of mind, and even patience; some of those"|FALSE
15707|"    described in Sect. XL. were found difficult to see, by many, who tried"|FALSE
15707|"    them; now it happens, that the mind, during the confusion of vertigo,"|FALSE
15707|"    when all the other irritative tribes of motion, as well as those of"|FALSE
15707|"    vision, are in some degree disturbed, together with the fear of"|FALSE
15707|"    falling, is in a very unfit state for the contemplation of such weak"|FALSE
15707|"    sensations, as are occasioned by faint ocular spectra. Yet after"|FALSE
15707|"    frequently revolving, both with my eyes closed, and with them open, and"|FALSE
15707|"    attending to the spectra remaining in them, by shading the light from"|FALSE
15707|"    my eyelids more or less with my hand, I at length ceased to have the"|FALSE
15707|"    idea of going forward, after I stopped with my eyes closed; and saw"|FALSE
15707|"    changing spectra in my eyes, which seemed to move, as it were, over the"|FALSE
15707|"    field of vision; till at length, by repeated trials on sunny days, I"|FALSE
15707|"    persuaded myself, on opening my eyes, after revolving some time, on a"|FALSE
15707|"    shelf of gilded books in my library, that I could perceive the spectra"|FALSE
15707|"    in my eyes move forwards over one or two of the books, like the vapours"|FALSE
15707|"    in the air of a summer's day; and could so far undeceive myself, as to"|FALSE
15707|"    perceive the books to stand still. After more trials I sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"    brought myself to believe, that I saw changing spectra of lights and"|FALSE
15707|"    shades moving in my eyes, after turning round for some time, but did"|FALSE
15707|"    not imagine either the spectra or the objects to be in a state of"|FALSE
15707|"    gyration. I speak, however, with diffidence of these facts, as I could"|FALSE
15707|"    not always make the experiments succeed, when there was not a strong"|FALSE
15707|"    light in my room, or when my eyes were not in the most proper state for"|FALSE
15707|"    such observations."|FALSE
15707|"    The ingenious and learned M. Sauvage has mentioned other theories to"|FALSE
15707|"    account for the apparent circumgyration of objects in vertiginous"|FALSE
15707|"    people. As the retrograde motions of the particles of blood in the"|FALSE
15707|"    optic arteries, by spasm, or by fear, as is seen in the tails of"|FALSE
15707|"    tadpoles, and membranes between the fingers of frogs. Another cause he"|FALSE
15707|"    thinks may be from the librations to one side, and to the other, of the"|FALSE
15707|"    crystalline lens in the eye, by means of involuntary actions of the"|FALSE
15707|"    muscles, which constitute the ciliary process. Both these theories lie"|FALSE
15707|"    under the same objection as that of Dr. Wells before mentioned; namely,"|FALSE
15707|"    that the apparent motions of objects, after the observer has revolved"|FALSE
15707|"    for some time, should appear to vibrate this way and that; and not to"|FALSE
15707|"    circulate uniformly in a direction contrary to that, in which the"|FALSE
15707|"    observer had revolved."|FALSE
15707|"    M. Sauvage has, lastly, mentioned the theory of colours left in the"|FALSE
15707|"    eye, which he has termed impressions on the retina. He says,"|FALSE
15707|"    \"Experience teaches us, that impressions made on the retina by a"|FALSE
15707|"    visible object remain some seconds after the object is removed; as"|FALSE
15707|"    appears from the circle of fire which we see, when a fire-stick is"|FALSE
15707|"    whirled round in the dark; therefore when we are carried round our own"|FALSE
15707|"    axis in a circle, we undergo a temporary vertigo, when we stop; because"|FALSE
15707|"    the impressions of the circumjacent objects remain for a time"|FALSE
15707|"    afterwards on the retina.\" Nosolog. Method. Clas. VIII. I. 1. We have"|FALSE
15707|"    before observed, that the changes of these colours remaining in the"|FALSE
15707|"    eye, evinces them to be motions of the fine terminations of the retina,"|FALSE
15707|"    and not impressions on it; as impressions on a passive substance must"|FALSE
15707|"    either remain, or cease intirely. See an additional note at the end of"|FALSE
15707|"    the second volume."|FALSE
15707|"Any one, who stands alone on the top of a high tower, if he has not been"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed to balance himself by objects placed at such distances and with"|FALSE
15707|"such inclinations, begins to stagger, and endeavours to recover himself by"|FALSE
15707|"his muscular feelings. During this time the apparent motion of objects at a"|FALSE
15707|"distance below him is very great, and the spectra of these apparent motions"|FALSE
15707|"continue a little time after he has experienced them; and he is persuaded"|FALSE
15707|"to incline the contrary way to counteract their effects; and either"|FALSE
15707|"immediately falls, or applying his hands to the building, uses his muscular"|FALSE
15707|"feelings to preserve his perpendicular attitude, contrary to the erroneous"|FALSE
15707|"persuasions of his eyes. Whilst the person, who walks in the dark,"|FALSE
15707|"staggers, but without dizziness; for he neither has the sensation of moving"|FALSE
15707|"objects to take off his attention from his muscular feelings, nor has he"|FALSE
15707|"the spectra of those motions continued on his retina to add to his"|FALSE
15707|"confusion. It happens indeed sometimes to one landing on a tower, that the"|FALSE
15707|"idea of his not having room to extend his base by moving one of his feet"|FALSE
15707|"outwards, when he begins to incline, superadds fears to his other"|FALSE
15707|"inconveniences; which like surprise, joy, or any great degree of sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"enervates him in a moment, by employing the whole sensorial power, and by"|FALSE
15707|"thus breaking all the associated trains and tribes of motion."|FALSE
15707|"7. The irritative ideas of objects, whilst we are awake, are perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"present to our sense of sight; as we view the furniture of our rooms, or"|FALSE
15707|"the ground, we tread upon, throughout the whole day without attending to"|FALSE
15707|"it. And as our bodies are never at perfect rest during our waking hours,"|FALSE
15707|"these irritative ideas of objects are attended perpetually with irritative"|FALSE
15707|"ideas of their apparent motions. The ideas of apparent motions are always"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas, because we never attend to them, whether we attend to the"|FALSE
15707|"objects themselves, or to their real motions, or to neither. Hence the"|FALSE
15707|"ideas of the apparent motions of objects are a complete circle of"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas, which continue throughout the day."|FALSE
15707|"Also during all our waking hours, there is a perpetual confused sound of"|FALSE
15707|"various bodies, as of the wind in our rooms, the fire, distant"|FALSE
15707|"conversations, mechanic business; this continued buzz, as we are seldom"|FALSE
15707|"quite motionless, changes its loudness perpetually, like the sound of a"|FALSE
15707|"bell; which rises and falls as long as it continues, and seems to pulsate"|FALSE
15707|"on the ear. This any one may experience by turning himself round near a"|FALSE
15707|"waterfall; or by striking a glass bell, and then moving the direction of"|FALSE
15707|"its mouth towards the ears, or from them, as long as its vibrations"|FALSE
15707|"continue. Hence this undulation of indistinct sound makes another"|FALSE
15707|"concomitant circle of irritative ideas, which continues throughout the day."|FALSE
15707|"We hear this undulating sound, when we are perfectly at rest ourselves,"|FALSE
15707|"from other sonorous bodies besides bells; as from two organ-pipes, which"|FALSE
15707|"are nearly but not quite in unison, when they are sounded together. When a"|FALSE
15707|"bell is struck, the circular form is changed into an eliptic one; the"|FALSE
15707|"longest axis of which, as the vibrations continue, moves round the"|FALSE
15707|"periphery of the bell; and when either axis of this elipse is pointed"|FALSE
15707|"towards our ears, the sound is louder; and less when the intermediate parts"|FALSE
15707|"of the elipse are opposite to us. The vibrations of the two organ-pipes may"|FALSE
15707|"be compared to Nonius's rule; the sound is louder, when they coincide, and"|FALSE
15707|"less at the intermediate times. But, as the sound of bells is the most"|FALSE
15707|"familiar of those sounds, which have a considerable battement, the"|FALSE
15707|"vertiginous patients, who attend to the irritative circles of sounds above"|FALSE
15707|"described, generally compare it to the noise of bells."|FALSE
15707|"The peristaltic motions of our stomach and intestines, and the secretions"|FALSE
15707|"of the various glands, are other circles of irritative motions, some of"|FALSE
15707|"them more or less complete, according to our abstinence or satiety."|FALSE
15707|"So that the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of objects, the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative battements of sounds, and the movements of our bowels and glands"|FALSE
15707|"compose a great circle of irritative tribes of motion: and when one"|FALSE
15707|"considerable part of this circle of motions becomes interrupted, the whole"|FALSE
15707|"proceeds in confusion, as described in Section XVII. 1. 7. on Catenation of"|FALSE
15707|"Motions."|FALSE
15707|"8. Hence a violent vertigo, from whatever cause it happens, is generally"|FALSE
15707|"attended with undulating noise in the head, perversions of the motions of"|FALSE
15707|"the stomach and duodenum, unusual excretion of bile and gastric juice, with"|FALSE
15707|"much pale urine, sometimes with yellowness of the skin, and a disordered"|FALSE
15707|"secretion of almost every gland of the body, till at length the arterial"|FALSE
15707|"system is affected, and fever succeeds."|FALSE
15707|"Thus bilious vomitings accompany the vertigo occasioned by the motion of a"|FALSE
15707|"ship; and when the brain is rendered vertiginous by a paralytic affection"|FALSE
15707|"of any part of the body, a vomiting generally ensues, and a great discharge"|FALSE
15707|"of bile: and hence great injuries of the head from external violence are"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded with bilious vomitings, and sometimes with abscesses of the"|FALSE
15707|"liver. And hence, when a patient is inclined to vomit from other causes, as"|FALSE
15707|"in some fevers, any motions of the attendants in his room, or of himself"|FALSE
15707|"when he is raised or turned in his bed, presently induces the vomiting by"|FALSE
15707|"superadding a degree of vertigo."|FALSE
15707|"9. And conversely it is very usual with those, whose stomachs are affected"|FALSE
15707|"from internal causes, to be afflicted with vertigo, and noise in the head;"|FALSE
15707|"such is the vertigo of drunken people, which continues, when their eyes are"|FALSE
15707|"closed, and themselves in a recumbent posture, as well as when they are in"|FALSE
15707|"an erect posture, and have their eyes open. And thus the irritation of a"|FALSE
15707|"stone in the bile-duct, or in the ureter, or an inflammation of any of the"|FALSE
15707|"intestines, are accompanied with vomitings and vertigo."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the irritative motions of the stomach, which are in general"|FALSE
15707|"not attended to, become so changed by some unnatural stimulus, as to become"|FALSE
15707|"uneasy, and excite our sensation or attention. And thus the other"|FALSE
15707|"irritative trains of motions, which are associated with it, become"|FALSE
15707|"disordered by their sympathy. The same happens, when a piece of gravel"|FALSE
15707|"sticks in the ureter, or when some part of the intestinal canal becomes"|FALSE
15707|"inflamed. In these cases the irritative muscular motions are first"|FALSE
15707|"disturbed by unusual stimulus, and a disordered action of the sensual"|FALSE
15707|"motions, or dizziness ensues. While in sea-sickness the irritative sensual"|FALSE
15707|"motions, as vertigo, precedes; and the disordered irritative muscular"|FALSE
15707|"motions, as those of the stomach in vomiting, follow."|FALSE
15707|"10. When these irritative motions are disturbed, if the degree be not very"|FALSE
15707|"great, the exertion of voluntary attention to any other object, or any"|FALSE
15707|"sudden sensation, will disjoin these new habits of motion. Thus some"|FALSE
15707|"drunken people have become sober immediately, when any accident has"|FALSE
15707|"strongly excited their attention; and sea-sickness has vanished, when the"|FALSE
15707|"ship has been in danger. Hence when our attention to other objects is most"|FALSE
15707|"relaxed, as just before we fall asleep, or between our reveries when awake,"|FALSE
15707|"these irritative ideas of motion and sound are most liable to be perceived;"|FALSE
15707|"as those, who have been at sea, or have travelled long in a coach, seem to"|FALSE
15707|"perceive the vibrations of the ship, or the rattling of the wheels, at"|FALSE
15707|"these intervals; which cease again, as soon as they exert their attention."|FALSE
15707|"That is, at those intervals they attend to the apparent motions, and to the"|FALSE
15707|"battement of sounds of the bodies around them, and for a moment mistake"|FALSE
15707|"them for those real motions of the ship, and noise of wheels, which they"|FALSE
15707|"had lately been accustomed to: or at these intervals of reverie, or on the"|FALSE
15707|"approach of sleep, these supposed motions or sounds may be produced"|FALSE
15707|"entirely by imagination."|FALSE
15707|"We may conclude from this account of vertigo, that sea-sickness is not an"|FALSE
15707|"effort of nature to relieve herself, but a necessary consequence of the"|FALSE
15707|"associations or catenations of animal motions. And may thence infer, that"|FALSE
15707|"the vomiting, which attends the gravel in the ureter, inflammations of the"|FALSE
15707|"bowels, and the commencement of some fevers, has a similar origin, and is"|FALSE
15707|"not always an effort of the vis medicatrix naturæ. But where the action of"|FALSE
15707|"the organ is the immediate consequence of the stimulating cause, it is"|FALSE
15707|"frequently exerted to dislodge that stimulus, as in vomiting up an emetic"|FALSE
15707|"drug; at other times, the action of an organ is a general effort to relieve"|FALSE
15707|"pain, as in convulsions of the locomotive muscles; other actions drink up"|FALSE
15707|"and carry on the fluids, as in absorption and secretion; all which may be"|FALSE
15707|"termed efforts of nature to relieve, or to preserve herself."|FALSE
15707|"11. The cure of vertigo will frequently depend on our previously"|FALSE
15707|"investigating the cause of it, which from what has been delivered above may"|FALSE
15707|"originate from the disorder of any part of the great tribes of irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions, and of the associate motions catenated with them."|FALSE
15707|"Many people, when they arrive at fifty or sixty years of age, are affected"|FALSE
15707|"with slight vertigo; which is generally but wrongly ascribed to"|FALSE
15707|"indigestion, but in reality arises from a beginning defect of their sight;"|FALSE
15707|"as about this time they also find it necessary to begin to use spectacles,"|FALSE
15707|"when they read small prints, especially in winter, or by candle light, but"|FALSE
15707|"are yet able to read without them during the summer days, when the light is"|FALSE
15707|"stronger. These people do not see objects so distinctly as formerly, and by"|FALSE

15707|"succeeded by sensation; and thus the other parts of the trains of"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas, or irritative muscular motions, become disordered, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained above. In these cases of slight vertigo I have always promised my"|FALSE
15707|"patients, that they would get free from it in two or three months, as they"|FALSE
15707|"should acquire the habit of balancing their bodies by less distinct"|FALSE

15707|"There is an auditory vertigo, which is called a noise in the head,"|FALSE
15707|"explained in No. 7. of this section, which also is very liable to affect"|FALSE
15707|"people in the advance of life, and is owing to their hearing less perfectly"|FALSE
15707|"than before. This is sometimes called a ringing, and sometimes a singing,"|FALSE
15707|"or buzzing, in the ears, and is occasioned by our first experiencing a"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation from our not being able distinctly to hear the"|FALSE
15707|"sounds, we used formerly to hear distinctly. And this disagreeable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation excites desire and consequent volition; and when we voluntarily"|FALSE
15707|"attend to small indistinct sounds, even the whispering of the air in a"|FALSE
15707|"room, and the pulsations of the arteries of the ear are succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; which minute sounds ought only to have produced irritative"|FALSE
15707|"sensual motions, or unperceived ideas. See Section XVII. 3. 6. These"|FALSE
15707|"patients after a while lose this auditory vertigo, by acquiring a new habit"|FALSE
15707|"of not attending voluntarily to these indistinct sounds, but contenting"|FALSE
15707|"themselves with the less accuracy of their sense of hearing."|FALSE
15707|"Another kind of vertigo begins with the disordered action of some"|FALSE
15707|"irritative muscular motions, as those of the stomach from intoxication, or"|FALSE
15707|"from emetics; or those of the ureter, from the stimulus of a stone lodged"|FALSE

15707|"The juices of some bitter vegetables, as of the poppy and the laurocerasus,"|FALSE

15707|"effect, by presenting indistinct ideas of inconsequential sounds, and by"|FALSE
15707|"thus stealing our attention from other objects, whilst by their continued"|FALSE
15707|"reiterations they become familiar themselves, and we cease gradually to"|FALSE
15707|"attend to any thing, and sleep ensues."|FALSE
15707|"2. After great fatigue or inanition, when the stomach is suddenly filled"|FALSE
15707|"with flesh and vegetable food, the inattention to external stimuli, and the"|FALSE

15707|"or opium to our common meals; or by taking these separately in considerable"|FALSE
15707|"quantity; and this more efficaciously after fatigue or inanition; because a"|FALSE
15707|"less quantity of any stimulating material will excite an organ into"|FALSE
15707|"energetic action, after it has lately been torpid from defect of stimulus;"|FALSE
15707|"as objects appear more luminous, after we have been in the dark; and"|FALSE
15707|"because the suspension of volition, which is the immediate cause of sleep,"|FALSE
15707|"is sooner induced, after a continued voluntary exertion has in part"|FALSE
15707|"exhausted the sensorial power of volition; in the same manner as we cannot"|FALSE
15707|"contract a single muscle long together without intervals of inaction."|FALSE
15707|"3. In the beginning of intoxication we are inclined to sleep, as mentioned"|FALSE
15707|"above, but by the excitement of external circumstances, as of noise, light,"|FALSE
15707|"business, or by the exertion of volition, we prevent the approaches of it,"|FALSE
15707|"and continue to take into our stomach greater quantities of the inebriating"|FALSE
15707|"materials. By these means the irritative movements of the stomach are"|FALSE
15707|"excited into greater action than is natural; and in consequence all the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative tribes and trains of motion, which are catenated with them,"|FALSE
15707|"become susceptible of stronger action from their accustomed stimuli;"|FALSE
15707|"because these motions are excited both by their usual irritation, and by"|FALSE
15707|"their association with the increased actions of the stomach and lacteals."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the skin glows, and the heat of the body is increased, by the more"|FALSE
15707|"energetic action of the whole glandular system; and pleasure is introduced"|FALSE
15707|"in consequence of these increased motions from internal stimulus. According"|FALSE
15707|"to Law 5. Sect. IV. on Animal Causation."|FALSE
15707|"From this great increase of irritative motions from internal stimulus, and"|FALSE
15707|"the increased sensation introduced into the system in consequence; and"|FALSE
15707|"secondly, from the increased sensitive motions in consequence of this"|FALSE
15707|"additional quantity of sensation, so much sensorial power is expended, that"|FALSE
15707|"the voluntary power becomes feebly exerted, and the irritation from the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of external objects is less forcible; the external parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye are not therefore voluntarily adapted to the distances of objects,"|FALSE
15707|"whence the apparent motions of those objects either are seen double, or"|FALSE
15707|"become too indistinct for the purpose of balancing the body, and vertigo is"|FALSE
15707|"induced."|FALSE
15707|"Hence we become acquainted with that very curious circumstance, why the"|FALSE
15707|"drunken vertigo is attended with an increase of pleasure; for the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas and motions occasioned by internal stimulus, that were not"|FALSE
15707|"attended to in our sober hours, are now just so much increased as to be"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded by pleasurable sensation, in the same manner as the more violent"|FALSE
15707|"motions of our organs are succeeded by painful sensation. And hence a"|FALSE
15707|"greater quantity of pleasurable sensation is introduced into the"|FALSE
15707|"constitution; which is attended in some people with an increase of"|FALSE
15707|"benevolence and good humour."|FALSE
15707|"If the apparent motions of objects is much increased, as when we revolve on"|FALSE
15707|"one foot, or are swung on a rope, the ideas of these apparent motions are"|FALSE
15707|"also attended to, and are succeeded with pleasureable sensation, till they"|FALSE
15707|"become familiar to us by frequent use. Hence children are at first"|FALSE
15707|"delighted with these kinds of exercise, and with riding, and failing, and"|FALSE
15707|"hence rocking young children inclines them to sleep. For though in the"|FALSE
15707|"vertigo from intoxication the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of"|FALSE
15707|"objects are indistinct from their decrease of energy: yet in the vertigo"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned by rocking or swinging the irritative ideas of the apparent"|FALSE
15707|"motions of objects are increased in energy, and hence they induce pleasure"|FALSE
15707|"into the system, but are equally indistinct, and in consequence equally"|FALSE
15707|"unfit to balance ourselves by. This addition of pleasure precludes desire"|FALSE
15707|"or aversion, and in consequence the voluntary power is feebly exerted, and"|FALSE
15707|"on this account rocking young children inclines them to sleep."|FALSE
15707|"In what manner opium and wine act in relieving pain is another article,"|FALSE
15707|"that well deserves our attention. There are many pains that originate from"|FALSE
15707|"defect as well as from excess of stimulus; of these are those of the six"|FALSE
15707|"appetites of hunger, thirst, lust, the want of heat, of distention, and of"|FALSE
15707|"fresh air. Thus if our cutaneous capillaries cease to act from the"|FALSE
15707|"diminished stimulus of heat, when we are exposed to cold weather, or our"|FALSE
15707|"stomach is uneasy for want of food; these are both pains from defect of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, and in consequence opium, which stimulates all the moving system"|FALSE
15707|"into increased action, must relieve them. But this is not the case in those"|FALSE
15707|"pains, which arise from excess of stimulus, as in violent inflammations: in"|FALSE
15707|"these the exhibition of opium is frequently injurious by increasing the"|FALSE
15707|"action of the system already too great, as in inflammation of the bowels"|FALSE
15707|"mortification is often produced by the stimulus of opium. Where, however,"|FALSE
15707|"no such bad consequences follow; the stimulus of opium, by increasing all"|FALSE
15707|"the motions of the system, expends so much of the sensorial power, that the"|FALSE
15707|"actions of the whole system soon become feebler, and in consequence those"|FALSE
15707|"which produced the pain and inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"4. When intoxication proceeds a little further, the quantity of pleasurable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation is so far increased, that all desire ceases, for there is no pain"|FALSE
15707|"in the system to excite it. Hence the voluntary exertions are diminished,"|FALSE
15707|"staggering and stammering succeed; and the trains of ideas become more and"|FALSE
15707|"more inconsistent from this defect of voluntary exertion, as explained in"|FALSE
15707|"the sections on sleep and reverie, whilst those passions which are unmixed"|FALSE
15707|"with volition are more vividly felt, and shewn with less reserve; hence"|FALSE
15707|"pining love, or superstitious fear, and the maudling tear dropped on the"|FALSE
15707|"remembrance of the most trifling distress."|FALSE
15707|"5. At length all these circumstances are increased; the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure introduced into the system by the increased irritative muscular"|FALSE
15707|"motions of the whole sanguiferous, and glandular, and absorbent systems,"|FALSE
15707|"becomes so great, that the organs of sense are more forcibly excited into"|FALSE
15707|"action by this internal pleasurable sensation, than by the irritation from"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus of external objects. Hence the drunkard ceases to attend to"|FALSE
15707|"external stimuli, and as volition is now also suspended, the trains of his"|FALSE
15707|"ideas become totally inconsistent as in dreams, or delirium: and at length"|FALSE
15707|"a stupor succeeds from the great exhaustion of sensorial power, which"|FALSE
15707|"probably does not even admit of dreams, and in which, as in apoplexy, no"|FALSE
15707|"motions continue but those from internal stimuli, from sensation, and from"|FALSE
15707|"association."|FALSE
15707|"6. In other people a paroxysm of drunkenness has another termination; the"|FALSE
15707|"inebriate, as soon as he begins to be vertiginous, makes pale urine in"|FALSE
15707|"great quantities and very frequently, and at length becomes sick, vomits"|FALSE
15707|"repeatedly, or purges, or has profuse sweats, and a temporary fever ensues"|FALSE
15707|"with a quick strong pulse. This in some hours is succeeded by sleep; but"|FALSE
15707|"the unfortunate bacchanalian does not perfectly recover himself till about"|FALSE
15707|"the same time of the succeeding day, when his course of inebriation began."|FALSE
15707|"As shewn in Sect. XVII. 1. 7. on Catenation. The temporary fever with"|FALSE
15707|"strong pulse is owing to the same cause as the glow on the skin mentioned"|FALSE
15707|"in the third paragraph of this Section: the flow of urine and sickness"|FALSE
15707|"arises from the whole system of irritative motions being thrown into"|FALSE
15707|"confusion by their associations with each other; as in sea-sickness,"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned in Sect. XX. 4. on Vertigo; and which is more fully explained in"|FALSE
15707|"Section XXIX. on Diabetes."|FALSE
15707|"7. In this vertigo from internal causes we see objects double, as two"|FALSE
15707|"candles instead of one, which is thus explained. Two lines drawn through"|FALSE
15707|"the axes of our two eyes meet at the object we attend to: this angle of the"|FALSE
15707|"optic axes increases or diminishes with the less or greater distances of"|FALSE
15707|"objects. All objects before or behind the place where this angle is formed,"|FALSE
15707|"appear double; as any one may observe by holding up a pen between his eyes"|FALSE
15707|"and the candle; when he looks attentively at a spot on the pen, and"|FALSE
15707|"carelessly at the candle, it will appear double; and the reverse when he"|FALSE
15707|"looks attentively at the candle and carelessly at the pen; so that in this"|FALSE
15707|"case the muscles of the eye, like those of the limbs, stagger and are"|FALSE
15707|"disobedient to the expiring efforts of volition. Numerous objects are"|FALSE
15707|"indeed sometimes seen by the inebriate, occasioned by the refractions made"|FALSE
15707|"by the tears, which stand upon his eye-lids."|FALSE
15707|"8. This vertigo also continues, when the inebriate lies in his bed, in the"|FALSE
15707|"dark, or with his eyes closed; and this more powerfully than when he is"|FALSE
15707|"erect, and in the light. For the irritative ideas of the apparent motions"|FALSE
15707|"of objects are now excited by irritation from internal stimulus, or by"|FALSE
15707|"association with other irritative motions; and the inebriate, like one in a"|FALSE
15707|"dream, believes the objects of these irritative motions to be present, and"|FALSE
15707|"feels himself vertiginous. I have observed in this situation, so long as my"|FALSE
15707|"eyes and mind were intent upon a book, the sickness and vertigo ceased, and"|FALSE
15707|"were renewed again the moment I discontinued this attention; as was"|FALSE
15707|"explained in the preceding account of sea-sickness. Some drunken people"|FALSE
15707|"have been known to become sober instantly from some accident, that has"|FALSE
15707|"strongly excited their attention, as the pain of a broken bone, or the news"|FALSE
15707|"of their house being on fire."|FALSE
15707|"9. Sometimes the vertigo from internal causes, as from intoxication, or at"|FALSE
15707|"the beginning of some fevers, becomes so universal, that the irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions which belong to other organs of sense are succeeded by sensation or"|FALSE
15707|"attention, as well as those of the eye. The vertiginous noise in the ears"|FALSE
15707|"has been explained in Section XX. on Vertigo. The taste of the saliva,"|FALSE
15707|"which in general is not attended to, becomes perceptible, and the patients"|FALSE
15707|"complain of a bad taste in their mouth."|FALSE
15707|"The common smells of the surrounding air sometimes excite the attention of"|FALSE
15707|"these patients, and bad smells are complained of, which to other people are"|FALSE
15707|"imperceptible. The irritative motions that belong to the sense of pressure,"|FALSE
15707|"or of touch, are attended to, and the patient conceives the bed to librate,"|FALSE
15707|"and is fearful of falling out of it. The irritative motions belonging to"|FALSE
15707|"the senses of distention, and of heat, like those above mentioned, become"|FALSE
15707|"attended to at this time: hence we feel the pulsation of our arteries all"|FALSE
15707|"over us, and complain of heat, or of cold, in parts of the body where there"|FALSE
15707|"is no accumulation or diminution of actual heat. All which are to be"|FALSE
15707|"explained, as in the last paragraph, by the irritative ideas belonging to"|FALSE
15707|"the various senses being now excited by internal stimuli, or by their"|FALSE
15707|"associations with other irritative motions. And that the inebriate, like"|FALSE
15707|"one in a dream, believes the external objects, which usually caused these"|FALSE
15707|"irritative ideas, to be now present."|FALSE
15707|"10. The diseases in consequence of frequent inebriety, or of daily taking"|FALSE
15707|"much vinous spirit without inebriety, consist in the paralysis, which is"|FALSE
15707|"liable to succeed violent stimulation. Organs, whose actions are associated"|FALSE
15707|"with others, are frequently more affected than the organ, which is"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated into too violent action. See Sect. XXIV. 2. 8. Hence in drunken"|FALSE
15707|"people it generally happens, that the secretory vessels of the liver become"|FALSE
15707|"first paralytic, and a torpor with consequent gall-stones or schirrus of"|FALSE
15707|"this viscus is induced with concomitant jaundice; otherwise it becomes"|FALSE
15707|"inflamed in consequence of previous torpor, and this inflammation is"|FALSE
15707|"frequently transferred to a more sensible part, which is associated with"|FALSE
15707|"it, and produces the gout, or the rosy eruption of the face, or some other"|FALSE
15707|"leprous eruption on the head, or arms, or legs. Sometimes the stomach is"|FALSE
15707|"first affected, and paralysis of the lacteal system is induced: whence a"|FALSE
15707|"total abhorrence from flesh-food, and general emaciation. In others the"|FALSE
15707|"lymphatic system is affected with paralysis, and dropsy is the consequence."|FALSE
15707|"In some inebriates the torpor of the liver produces pain without apparent"|FALSE
15707|"schirrus, or gall stones, or inflammation, or consequent gout, and in these"|FALSE
15707|"epilepsy or insanity are often the consequence. All which will be more"|FALSE
15707|"fully treated of in the course of the work."|FALSE
15707|"I am well aware, that it is a common opinion, that the gout is as"|FALSE
15707|"frequently owing to gluttony in eating, as to intemperance in drinking"|FALSE
15707|"fermented or spirituous liquors. To this I answer, that I have seen no"|FALSE
15707|"person afflicted with the gout, who has not drank freely of fermented"|FALSE
15707|"liquor, as wine and water, or small beer; though as the disposition to all"|FALSE
15707|"the diseases, which have originated from intoxication, is in some degree"|FALSE
15707|"hereditary, a less quantity of spirituous potation will induce the gout in"|FALSE
15707|"those, who inherit the disposition from their parents. To which I must add,"|FALSE
15707|"that in young people the rheumatism is frequently mistaken for the gout."|FALSE
15707|"Spice is seldom taken in such quantity as to do any material injury to the"|FALSE
15707|"system, flesh-meats as well as vegetables are the natural diet of mankind;"|FALSE
15707|"with these a glutton may be crammed up to the throat, and fed fat like a"|FALSE
15707|"stalled ox; but he will not be diseased, unless he adds spirituous or"|FALSE
15707|"fermented liquor to his food. This is well known in the distilleries, where"|FALSE
15707|"the swine, which are fattened by the spirituous sediments of barrels,"|FALSE
15707|"acquire diseased livers. But mark what happens to a man, who drinks a quart"|FALSE
15707|"of wine or of ale, if he has not been habituated to it. He loses the use"|FALSE
15707|"both of his limbs and of his understanding! He becomes a temporary idiot,"|FALSE
15707|"and has a temporary stroke of the palsy! And though he slowly recovers"|FALSE
15707|"after some hours, is it not reasonable to conclude, that a perpetual"|FALSE
15707|"repetition of so powerful a poison must at length permanently affect"|FALSE
15707|"him?--If a person accidentally becomes intoxicated by eating a few"|FALSE
15707|"mushrooms of a peculiar kind, a general alarm is excited, and he is said to"|FALSE
15707|"be poisoned, and emetics are exhibited; but so familiarised are we to the"|FALSE
15707|"intoxication from vinous spirit, that it occasions laughter rather than"|FALSE
15707|"alarm."|FALSE
15707|"There is however considerable danger in too hastily discontinuing the use"|FALSE
15707|"of so strong a stimulus, lest the torpor of the system, or paralysis,"|FALSE
15707|"should sooner be induced by the omission than by the continuance of this"|FALSE
15707|"habit, when unfortunately acquired. A golden rule for determining the"|FALSE
15707|"quantity, which may with safety be discontinued, is delivered in Sect. XII."|FALSE

15707|"Besides the very great quantity of sensorial power perpetually produced and"|FALSE

15707|"also a constant expenditure of it by the action of our locomotive muscles"|FALSE

15707|"together, according to Law the seventh, Section IV. on Animal Causation."|FALSE
15707|"And because their frequency of repetition, if as much sensorial power be"|FALSE

15707|"If a stimulus be repeated at uniform intervals of time, as described in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XII. 3. 3. the action, whether of our muscles or organs of sense, is"|FALSE
15707|"produced with still greater facility or energy; because the sensorial power"|FALSE

15707|"power of the stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"This not only obtains in the annual, lunar, and diurnal catenations of"|FALSE

15707|"receive from the rhimes and alliterations of modern verification; the"|FALSE
15707|"source of which without this key would be difficult to discover. And to"|FALSE
15707|"this likewise should be ascribed the beauty of the duplicature in the"|FALSE
15707|"perfect tense of the Greek verbs, and of some Latin ones, as tango tetegi,"|FALSE
15707|"mordeo momordi."|FALSE
15707|"There is no variety of notes referable to the gamut in the beating of the"|FALSE
15707|"drum, yet if it be performed in musical time, it is agreeable to our ears;"|FALSE
15707|"and therefore this pleasurable sensation must be owing to the repetition of"|FALSE
15707|"the divisions of the sounds at certain intervals of time, or musical bars."|FALSE
15707|"Whether these times or bars are distinguished by a pause, or by an"|FALSE
15707|"emphasis, or accent, certain it is, that this distinction is perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"repeated; otherwise the ear could not determine instantly, whether the"|FALSE
15707|"successions of sound were in common or in triple time. In common time there"|FALSE
15707|"is a division between every two crotchets, or other notes of equivalent"|FALSE
15707|"time; though the bar in written music is put after every fourth crotchet,"|FALSE
15707|"or notes equivalent in time; in triple time the division or bar is after"|FALSE
15707|"every three crotchets, or notes equivalent; so that in common time the"|FALSE
15707|"repetition recurs more frequently than in triple time. The grave or heroic"|FALSE
15707|"verses of the Greek and Latin poets are written in common time; the French"|FALSE
15707|"heroic verses, and Mr. Anstie's humorous verses in his Bath Guide, are"|FALSE
15707|"written in the same time as the Greek and Latin verses, but are one bar"|FALSE
15707|"shorter. The English grave or heroic verses are measured by triple time, as"|FALSE
15707|"Mr. Pope's translation of Homer."|FALSE
15707|"But besides these little circles of musical time, there are the greater"|FALSE
15707|"returning periods, and the still more distant choruses, which, like the"|FALSE
15707|"rhimes at the ends of verses, owe their beauty to repetition; that is, to"|FALSE
15707|"the facility and distinctness with which we perceive sounds, which we"|FALSE
15707|"expect to perceive, or have perceived before; or in the language of this"|FALSE
15707|"work, to the greater ease and energy with which our organ is excited by the"|FALSE

15707|"singly."|FALSE
15707|"A certain uniformity or repetition of parts enters the very composition of"|FALSE
15707|"harmony. Thus two octaves nearest to each other in the scale commence their"|FALSE
15707|"vibrations together after every second vibration of the higher one. And"|FALSE
15707|"where the first, third, and fifth compose a chord the vibrations concur or"|FALSE

15707|"This kind of pleasure arising from repetition, that is from the facility"|FALSE
15707|"and distinctness, with which we perceive and understand repeated"|FALSE

15707|"excess is termed formality. The art of dancing like that of music depends"|FALSE
15707|"for a great part of the pleasure, it affords, on repetition; architecture,"|FALSE
15707|"especially the Grecian, consists of one part being a repetition of another;"|FALSE
15707|"and hence the beauty of the pyramidal outline in landscape-painting; where"|FALSE
15707|"one side of the picture may be said in some measure to balance the other."|FALSE
15707|"So universally does repetition contribute to our pleasure in the fine arts,"|FALSE
15707|"that beauty itself has been defined by some writers to consist in a due"|FALSE
15707|"combination of uniformity and variety. See Sect. XVI. 6."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Man is termed by Aristotle an imitative animal; this propensity to"|FALSE
15707|"imitation not only appears in the actions of children, but in all the"|FALSE
15707|"customs and fashions of the world: many thousands tread in the beaten paths"|FALSE
15707|"of others, for one who traverses regions of his own discovery. The origin"|FALSE
15707|"of this propensity of imitation has not, that I recollect, been deduced"|FALSE
15707|"from any known principle; when any action presents itself to the view of a"|FALSE
15707|"child, as of whetting a knife, or threading a needle, the parts of this"|FALSE
15707|"action in respect of time, motion, figure, is imitated by a part of the"|FALSE
15707|"retina of his eye; to perform this action therefore with his hands is"|FALSE
15707|"easier to him than to invent any new action, because it consists in"|FALSE
15707|"repeating with another set of fibres, viz. with the moving muscles, what he"|FALSE
15707|"had just performed by some parts of the retina; just as in dancing we"|FALSE
15707|"transfer the times of motion from the actions of the auditory nerves to the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles of the limbs. Imitation therefore consists of repetition, which we"|FALSE
15707|"have shewn above to be the easiest kind of animal action, and which we"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually fall into, when we possess an accumulation of sensorial power,"|FALSE
15707|"which is not otherwise called into exertion."|FALSE
15707|"It has been shewn, that our ideas are configurations of the organs of"|FALSE
15707|"sense, produced originally in consequence of the stimulus of external"|FALSE
15707|"bodies. And that these ideas, or configurations of the organs of sense,"|FALSE
15707|"referable in some property a correspondent property of external matter; as"|FALSE
15707|"the parts of the senses of light and of touch, which are excited into"|FALSE
15707|"action, resemble in figure the figure of the stimulating body; and probably"|FALSE
15707|"also the colour, and the quantity of density, which they perceive. As"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XIV. 2. 2. Hence it appears, that our perceptions"|FALSE
15707|"themselves are copies, that is, imitations of some properties of external"|FALSE
15707|"matter; and the propensity to imitation is thus interwoven with our"|FALSE
15707|"existence, as it is produced by the stimuli of external bodies, and is"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards repeated by our volitions and sensations, and thus constitutes"|FALSE
15707|"all the operations of our minds."|FALSE
15707|"2. Imitations resolve themselves into four kinds, voluntary, sensitive,"|FALSE
15707|"irritative, and associate. The voluntary imitations are, when we imitate"|FALSE
15707|"deliberately the actions of others, either by mimicry, as in acting a play,"|FALSE
15707|"or in delineating a flower; or in the common actions of our lives, as in"|FALSE
15707|"our dress, cookery, language, manners, and even in our habits of thinking."|FALSE
15707|"Not only the greatest part of mankind learn all the common arts of life by"|FALSE
15707|"imitating others, but brute animals seem capable of acquiring knowledge"|FALSE
15707|"with greater facility by imitating each other, than by any methods by which"|FALSE
15707|"we can teach them; as dogs and cats, when they are sick, learn of each"|FALSE
15707|"other to eat grass; and I suppose, that by making an artificial dog perform"|FALSE
15707|"certain tricks, as in dancing on his hinder legs, a living dog might be"|FALSE
15707|"easily induced to imitate them; and that the readiest way of instructing"|FALSE
15707|"dumb animals is by practising them with others of the same species, which"|FALSE
15707|"have already learned the arts we wish to teach them. The important use of"|FALSE
15707|"imitation in acquiring natural language is mentioned in Section XVI. 7. and"|FALSE
15707|"8. on Instinct."|FALSE
15707|"3. The sensitive imitations are the immediate consequences of pleasure or"|FALSE
15707|"pain, and these are often produced even contrary to the efforts of the"|FALSE
15707|"will. Thus many young men on seeing cruel surgical operations become sick,"|FALSE
15707|"and some even feel pain in the parts of their own bodies, which they see"|FALSE
15707|"tortured or wounded in others; that is, they in some measure imitate by the"|FALSE
15707|"exertions of their own fibres the violent actions, which they witnessed in"|FALSE
15707|"those of others. In this case a double imitation takes place, first the"|FALSE
15707|"observer imitates with the extremities of the optic nerve the mangled"|FALSE
15707|"limbs, which are present before his eyes; then by a second imitation he"|FALSE
15707|"excites to violent action of the fibres of his own limbs as to produce pain"|FALSE
15707|"in those parts of his own body, which he saw wounded in another. In these"|FALSE
15707|"pains produced by imitation the effect has some similarity to the cause,"|FALSE
15707|"which distinguishes them from those produced by association; as the pains"|FALSE
15707|"of the teeth, called tooth-edge, which are produced by association with"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sounds, as explained in Sect. XVI. 10."|FALSE
15707|"The effect of this powerful agent, imitation, in the moral world, is"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned in Sect. XVI. 7. as it is the foundation of all our intellectual"|FALSE
15707|"sympathies with the pains and pleasures of others, and is in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"the source of all our virtues. For in what consists our sympathy with the"|FALSE
15707|"miseries, or with the joys, of our fellow creatures, but in an involuntary"|FALSE
15707|"excitation of ideas in some measure similar or imitative of those, which we"|FALSE
15707|"believe to exist in the minds of the persons, whom we commiserate or"|FALSE
15707|"congratulate?"|FALSE
15707|"There are certain concurrent or successive actions of some of the glands,"|FALSE
15707|"or other parts of the body, which are possessed of sensation, which become"|FALSE
15707|"intelligible from this propensity to imitation. Of these are the production"|FALSE
15707|"of matter by the membranes of the fauces, or by the skin, in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"the venereal disease previously affecting the parts of generation. Since as"|FALSE
15707|"no fever is excited, and as neither the blood of such patients, nor even"|FALSE
15707|"the matter from ulcers of the throat, or from cutaneous ulcers, will by"|FALSE
15707|"inoculation produce the venereal disease in others, as observed by Mr."|FALSE
15707|"Hunter, there is reason to conclude, that no contagious matter is conveyed"|FALSE
15707|"thither by the blood-vessels, but that a milder matter is formed by the"|FALSE
15707|"actions of the fine vessels in those membranes imitating each other. See"|FALSE
15707|"Section XXXIII. 2. 9. In this disease the actions of these vessels"|FALSE
15707|"producing ulcers on the throat and skin are imperfect imitations of those"|FALSE
15707|"producing chanker, or gonorrhoea; since the matter produced by them is not"|FALSE
15707|"infectious, while the imitative actions in the hydrophobia appear to be"|FALSE
15707|"perfect resemblances, as they produce a material equally infectious with"|FALSE
15707|"the original one, which induced them."|FALSE
15707|"The contagion from the bite of a mad dog differs from other contagious"|FALSE
15707|"materials, from its being communicable from other animals to mankind, and"|FALSE
15707|"from many animals to each other; the phenomena attending the hydrophobia"|FALSE
15707|"are in some degree explicable on the foregoing theory. The infectious"|FALSE
15707|"matter does not appear to enter the circulation, as it cannot be traced"|FALSE
15707|"along the course of the lymphatics from the wound, nor is there any"|FALSE
15707|"swelling of the lymphatic glands, nor does any fever attend, as occurs in"|FALSE
15707|"the small-pox, and in many other contagious diseases; yet by some unknown"|FALSE
15707|"process the disease is communicated from the wound to the throat, and that"|FALSE
15707|"many months after the injury, so as to produce pain and hydrophobia, with a"|FALSE
15707|"secretion of infectious saliva of the same kind, as that of the mad dog,"|FALSE
15707|"which inflicted the wound."|FALSE
15707|"This subject is very intricate.--It would appear, that by certain morbid"|FALSE
15707|"actions of the salivary glands of the mad dog, a peculiar kind of saliva is"|FALSE
15707|"produced; which being instilled into a wound of another animal stimulates"|FALSE
15707|"the cutaneous or mucous glands into morbid actions, but which are"|FALSE
15707|"ineffectual in respect to the production of a similar contagious material;"|FALSE
15707|"but the salivary glands by irritative sympathy are thrown into similar"|FALSE
15707|"action, and produce an infectious saliva similar to that instilled into the"|FALSE
15707|"wound."|FALSE
15707|"Though in many contagious fevers a material similar to that which produced"|FALSE
15707|"the disease, is thus generated by imitation; yet there are other infectious"|FALSE
15707|"materials, which do not thus propagate themselves, but which seem to act"|FALSE
15707|"like slow poisons. Of this kind was the contagious matter, which produced"|FALSE
15707|"the jail-fever at the assizes at Oxford about a century ago. Which, though"|FALSE
15707|"fatal to so many, was not communicated to their nurses or attendants. In"|FALSE
15707|"these cases, the imitations of the fine vessels, as above described, appear"|FALSE
15707|"to be imperfect, and do not therefore produce a matter similar to that,"|FALSE
15707|"which stimulates them; in this circumstance resembling the venereal matter"|FALSE
15707|"in ulcers of the throat or skin, according to the curious discovery of Mr."|FALSE
15707|"Hunter above related, who found, by repeated inoculations, that it would"|FALSE
15707|"not infect. Hunter on Venereal Disease, Part vi. ch. 1."|FALSE
15707|"Another example of morbid imitation is in the production of a great"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of contagious matter, as in the inoculated small-pox, from a small"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of it inserted into the arm, and probably diffused in the blood."|FALSE
15707|"These particles of contagious matter stimulate the extremities of the fine"|FALSE
15707|"arteries of the skin, and cause them to imitate some properties of those"|FALSE
15707|"particles of contagious matter, so as to produce a thousandfold of a"|FALSE
15707|"similar material. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 6. Other instances are mentioned in"|FALSE
15707|"the Section on Generation, which shew the probability that the extremities"|FALSE
15707|"of the seminal glands may imitate certain ideas of the mind, or actions of"|FALSE
15707|"the organs of sense, and thus occasion the male or female sex of the"|FALSE
15707|"embryon. See Sect. XXXIX. 6."|FALSE
15707|"4. We come now to those imitations, which are not attended with sensation."|FALSE
15707|"Of these are all the irritative ideas already explained, as when the retina"|FALSE
15707|"of the eye imitates by its action or configuration the tree or the bench,"|FALSE
15707|"which I shun in walking past without attending to them. Other examples of"|FALSE
15707|"these irritative imitations are daily observable in common life; thus one"|FALSE
15707|"yawning person shall set a whole company a yawning; and some have acquired"|FALSE
15707|"winking of the eyes or impediments of speech by imitating their companions"|FALSE
15707|"without being conscious of it."|FALSE
15707|"5. Besides the three species of imitations above described there may be"|FALSE
15707|"some associate motions, which may imitate each other in the kind as well as"|FALSE
15707|"in the quantity of their action; but it is difficult to distinguish them"|FALSE
15707|"from the associations of motions treated of in Section XXXV. Where the"|FALSE
15707|"actions of other persons are imitated there can be no doubt, or where we"|FALSE
15707|"imitate a preconceived idea by exertion of our locomotive muscles, as in"|FALSE
15707|"painting a dragon; all these imitations may aptly be referred to the"|FALSE
15707|"sources above described of the propensity to activity, and the facility of"|FALSE
15707|"repetition; at the same time I do not affirm, that all those other apparent"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive and irritative imitations may not be resolvable into associations"|FALSE
15707|"of a peculiar kind, in which certain distant parts of similar irritability"|FALSE
15707|"or sensibility, and which have habitually acted together, may affect each"|FALSE
15707|"other exactly with the same kinds of motion; as many parts are known to"|FALSE
15707|"sympathise in the quantity of their motions. And that therefore they may be"|FALSE

15707|"convenience perhaps of the distribution of a subtile ethereal fluid for the"|FALSE

15707|"grosser fluids for the purposes of nutrition, communicate with each other"|FALSE
15707|"by the heart."|FALSE
15707|"The heart and arteries are hollow muscles, and are therefore indued with"|FALSE
15707|"power of contraction in consequence of stimulus, like all other muscular"|FALSE
15707|"fibres; but, as they have no antagonist muscles, the cavities of the"|FALSE
15707|"vessels, which they form, would remain for ever closed, after they have"|FALSE
15707|"contracted themselves, unless some extraneous power be applied to again"|FALSE

15707|"of blood, which is perpetually absorbed by the veins from the various"|FALSE

15707|"glands and capillaries."|FALSE
15707|"In the vessels of the liver there is no intervention of the heart; but the"|FALSE
15707|"vena portarum, which does the office of an artery, is distended by the"|FALSE
15707|"blood poured into it from the mesenteric veins, and is by this distention"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated to contract itself, and propel the blood to the mouths of the"|FALSE
15707|"numerous glands, which compose that viscus."|FALSE
15707|"II. The glandular system of vessels may be divided into those, which take"|FALSE
15707|"some fluid from the circulation; and those, which give something to it."|FALSE
15707|"Those, which take their fluid from the circulation are the various glands,"|FALSE
15707|"by which the tears, bile, urine, perspiration, and many other secretions"|FALSE
15707|"are produced; these glands probably consist of a mouth to select, a belly"|FALSE
15707|"to digest, and an excretory aperture to emit their appropriated fluids; the"|FALSE
15707|"blood is conveyed by the power of the heart and arteries to the mouths of"|FALSE
15707|"these glands, it is there taken up by the living power of the gland, and"|FALSE
15707|"carried forwards to its belly, and excretory aperture, where a part is"|FALSE
15707|"separated, and the remainder absorbed by the veins for further purposes."|FALSE
15707|"Some of these glands are furnished with long convoluted necks or tubes, as"|FALSE
15707|"the seminal ones, which are curiously seen when injected with quicksilver."|FALSE
15707|"Others seem to consist of shorter tubes, as that great congeries of glands,"|FALSE
15707|"which constitute the liver, and those of the kidneys. Some have their"|FALSE
15707|"excretory apertures opening into reservoirs, as the urinary and"|FALSE
15707|"gall-bladders. And others on the external body, as those which secrete the"|FALSE
15707|"tears, and perspirable matter."|FALSE
15707|"Another great system of glands, which have very short necks, are the"|FALSE
15707|"capillary vessels; by which the insensible perspiration is secreted on the"|FALSE
15707|"skin; and the mucus of various consistences, which lubricates the"|FALSE
15707|"interstices of the cellular membrane, of the muscular fibres, and of all"|FALSE
15707|"the larger cavities of the body. From the want of a long convolution of"|FALSE
15707|"vessels some have doubted, whether these capillaries should be considered"|FALSE
15707|"as glands, and have been led to conclude, that the perspirable matter"|FALSE
15707|"rather exuded than was secreted. But the fluid of perspiration is not"|FALSE
15707|"simple water, though that part of it, which exhales into the air may be"|FALSE
15707|"such; for there is another part of it, which in a state of health is"|FALSE
15707|"absorbed again; but which, when the absorbents are diseased, remains on the"|FALSE
15707|"surface of the skin, in the form of scurf, or indurated mucus. Another"|FALSE
15707|"thing, which shews their similitude to other glands, is their sensibility"|FALSE
15707|"to certain affections of the mind; as is seen in the deeper colour of the"|FALSE
15707|"skin in the blush of shame, or the greater paleness of it from fear."|FALSE
15707|"III. Another series of glandular vessels is called the absorbent system;"|FALSE
15707|"these open their mouths into all the cavities, and upon all those surfaces"|FALSE
15707|"of the body, where the excretory apertures of the other glands pour out"|FALSE
15707|"their fluids. The mouths of the absorbent system drink up a part or the"|FALSE
15707|"whole of these fluids, and carry them forwards by their living power to"|FALSE
15707|"their respective glands, which are called conglobate glands. There these"|FALSE
15707|"fluids undergo some change, before they pass on into the circulation; but"|FALSE
15707|"if they are very acrid, the conglobate gland swells, and sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"suppurates, as in inoculation of the small-pox, in the plague, and in"|FALSE
15707|"venereal absorptions; at other times the fluid may perhaps continue there,"|FALSE
15707|"till it undergoes some chemical change, that renders it less noxious; or,"|FALSE
15707|"what is more likely, till it is regurgitated by the retrograde motion of"|FALSE
15707|"the gland in spontaneous sweats or diarrhoeas, as disagreeing food is"|FALSE
15707|"vomited from the stomach."|FALSE
15707|"IV. As all the fluids, that pass through these glands, and capillary"|FALSE
15707|"vessels, undergo a chemical change, acquiring new combinations, the matter"|FALSE
15707|"of heat is at the same time given out; this is apparent, since whatever"|FALSE
15707|"increases insensible perspiration, increases the heat of the skin; and when"|FALSE
15707|"the action of these vessels is much increased but for a moment, as in"|FALSE
15707|"blushing, a vivid heat on the skin is the immediate consequence. So when"|FALSE
15707|"great bilious secretions, or those of any other gland, are produced, heat"|FALSE
15707|"is generated in the part in proportion to the quantity of the secretion."|FALSE
15707|"The heat produced on the skin by blushing may be thought by some too sudden"|FALSE
15707|"to be pronounced a chemical effect, as the fermentations or new"|FALSE
15707|"combinations taking place in a fluid is in general a slower process. Yet"|FALSE
15707|"are there many chemical mixtures in which heat is given out as"|FALSE
15707|"instantaneously; as in solutions of metals in acids, or in mixtures of"|FALSE
15707|"essential oils and acids, as of oil of cloves and acid of nitre. So the"|FALSE
15707|"bruised parts of an unripe apple become almost instantaneously sweet; and"|FALSE
15707|"if the chemico-animal process of digestion be stopped for but a moment, as"|FALSE
15707|"by fear, or even by voluntary eructation, a great quantity of air is"|FALSE
15707|"generated, by the fermentation, which instantly succeeds the stop of"|FALSE
15707|"digestion. By the experiments of Dr. Hales it appears, that an apple during"|FALSE
15707|"fermentation gave up above six hundred times its bulk of air; and the"|FALSE
15707|"materials in the stomach are such, and in such a situation, as immediately"|FALSE
15707|"to run into fermentation, when digestion is impeded."|FALSE
15707|"As the blood passes through the small vessels of the lungs, which connect"|FALSE
15707|"the pulmonary artery and vein, it undergoes a change of colour from a dark"|FALSE
15707|"to a light red; which may be termed a chemical change, as it is known to be"|FALSE
15707|"effected by an admixture of oxygene, or vital air; which, according to a"|FALSE
15707|"discovery of Dr. Priestley, passes through the moist membranes, which"|FALSE
15707|"constitute the sides of these vessels. As the blood passes through the"|FALSE
15707|"capillary vessels, and glands, which connect the aorta and its various"|FALSE
15707|"branches with their correspondent veins in the extremities of the body, it"|FALSE
15707|"again loses the bright red colour, and undergoes some new combinations in"|FALSE
15707|"the glands or capillaries, in which the matter of heat is given out from"|FALSE
15707|"the secreted fluids. This process therefore, as well as the process of"|FALSE
15707|"respiration, has some analogy to combustion, as the vital air or oxygene"|FALSE
15707|"seems to become united to some inflammable base, and the matter of heat"|FALSE
15707|"escapes from the new acid, which is thus produced."|FALSE
15707|"V. After the blood has passed these glands and capillaries, and parted with"|FALSE
15707|"whatever they chose to take from it, the remainder is received by the"|FALSE
15707|"veins, which are a set of blood-absorbing vessels in general corresponding"|FALSE
15707|"with the ramifications of the arterial system. At the extremity of the fine"|FALSE
15707|"convolutions of the glands the arterial force ceases; this in respect to"|FALSE
15707|"the capillary vessels, which unite the extremities of the arteries with the"|FALSE
15707|"commencement of the veins, is evident to the eye, on viewing the tail of a"|FALSE
15707|"tadpole by means of a solar, or even by a common microscope, for globules"|FALSE
15707|"of blood are seen to endeavour to pass, and to return again and again,"|FALSE
15707|"before they become absorbed by the mouths of the veins; which returning of"|FALSE
15707|"these globules evinces, that the arterial force behind them has ceased. The"|FALSE
15707|"veins are furnished with valves like the lymphatic absorbents; and the"|FALSE
15707|"great trunks of the veins, and of the lacteals and lymphatics, join"|FALSE
15707|"together before the ingress of their fluids into the left chamber of the"|FALSE
15707|"heart; both which evince, that the blood in the veins, and the lymph and"|FALSE
15707|"chyle in the lacteals and lymphatics, are carried on by a similar force;"|FALSE
15707|"otherwise the stream, which was propelled with a less power, could not"|FALSE
15707|"enter the vessels, which contained the stream propelled with a greater"|FALSE
15707|"power. From whence it appears, that the veins are a system of vessels"|FALSE
15707|"absorbing blood, as the lacteals and lymphatics are a system of vessels"|FALSE
15707|"absorbing chyle and lymph. See Sect. XXVII. 1."|FALSE
15707|"VI. The movements of their adapted fluids in the various vessels of the"|FALSE
15707|"body are carried forwards by the actions of those vessels in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"two kinds of stimulus, one of which may be compared to a pleasurable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation or desire inducing the vessel to seize, and, as it were, to"|FALSE
15707|"swallow the particles thus selected from the blood; as is done by the"|FALSE
15707|"mouths of the various glands, veins, and other absorbents, which may be"|FALSE
15707|"called glandular appetency. The other kind of stimulus may be compared to"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation, or aversion, as when the heart has received the"|FALSE
15707|"blood, and is stimulated by it to push it forwards into the arteries; the"|FALSE
15707|"same again stimulates the arteries to contract, and carry forwards the"|FALSE
15707|"blood to their extremities, the glands and capillaries. Thus the mesenteric"|FALSE
15707|"veins absorb the blood from the intestines by glandular appetency, and"|FALSE
15707|"carry it forward to the vena portarum; which acting as an artery contracts"|FALSE
15707|"itself by disagreeable stimulus, and pushes it to its ramified extremities,"|FALSE
15707|"the various glands, which constitute the liver."|FALSE
15707|"It seems probable, that at the beginning of the formation of these vessels"|FALSE
15707|"in the embryon, an agreeable sensation was in reality felt by the glands"|FALSE
15707|"during secretion, as is now felt in the act of swallowing palatable food;"|FALSE
15707|"and that a disagreeable sensation was originally felt by the heart from the"|FALSE
15707|"distention occasioned by the blood, or by its chemical stimulus; but that"|FALSE
15707|"by habit these are all become irritative motions; that is, such motions as"|FALSE
15707|"do not affect the whole system, except when the vessels are diseased by"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation."|FALSE

15707|"I. The salival glands drink up a certain fluid from the circumfluent blood,"|FALSE
15707|"and pour it into the mouth. They are sometimes stimulated into action by"|FALSE
15707|"the blood, that surrounds their origin, or by some part of that"|FALSE
15707|"heterogeneous fluid: for when mercurial salts, or oxydes, are mixed with"|FALSE
15707|"the blood, they stimulate these glands into unnatural exertions; and then"|FALSE
15707|"an unusual quantity of saliva is separated."|FALSE
15707|"1. As the saliva secreted by these glands is most wanted during the"|FALSE
15707|"mastication of our food, it happens, when the terminations of their ducts"|FALSE
15707|"in the mouth are stimulated into action, the salival glands themselves are"|FALSE
15707|"brought into increased action at the same time by association, and separate"|FALSE
15707|"a greater quantity of their juices from the blood; in the same manner as"|FALSE
15707|"tears are produced in greater abundance during the stimulus of the vapour"|FALSE
15707|"of onions, or of any other acrid material in the eye."|FALSE
15707|"The saliva is thus naturally poured into the mouth only during the stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"of our food in mastication; for when there is too great an exhalation of"|FALSE
15707|"the mucilaginous secretion from the membranes, which line the mouth, or too"|FALSE
15707|"great an absorption of it, the mouth becomes dry, though there is no"|FALSE
15707|"deficiency in the quantity of saliva; as in those who sleep with their"|FALSE
15707|"mouths open, and in some fevers."|FALSE
15707|"2. Though during the mastication of our natural food the salival glands are"|FALSE
15707|"excited into action by the stimulus on their excretory ducts, and a due"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of saliva is separated from the blood, and poured into the mouth;"|FALSE
15707|"yet as this mastication of our food is always attended with a degree of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure; and that pleasurable sensation is also connected with our ideas"|FALSE
15707|"of certain kinds of aliment; it follows, that when these ideas are"|FALSE
15707|"reproduced, the pleasurable sensation arises along with them, and the"|FALSE
15707|"salival glands are excited into action, and fill the mouth with saliva from"|FALSE
15707|"this sensitive association, as is frequently seen in dogs, who slaver at"|FALSE
15707|"the sight of food."|FALSE
15707|"3. We have also a voluntary power over the action of these salival glands,"|FALSE
15707|"for we can at any time produce a flow of saliva into our mouth, and spit"|FALSE
15707|"out, or swallow it at will."|FALSE
15707|"4. If any very acrid material be held in the mouth, as the root of"|FALSE
15707|"pyrethrum, or the leaves of tobacco, the salival glands are stimulated into"|FALSE
15707|"stronger action than is natural, and thence secrete a much larger quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of saliva; which is at the same time more viscid than in its natural state;"|FALSE
15707|"because the lymphatics, that open their mouths into the ducts of the"|FALSE
15707|"salival glands, and on the membranes, which line the mouth, are likewise"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated into stronger action, and absorb the more liquid parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"saliva with greater avidity; and the remainder is left both in greater"|FALSE
15707|"quantity and more viscid."|FALSE
15707|"The increased absorption in the mouth by some stimulating substances, which"|FALSE
15707|"are called astringents, as crab juice, is evident from the instant dryness"|FALSE
15707|"produced in the mouth by a small quantity of them."|FALSE
15707|"As the extremities of the glands are of exquisite tenuity, as appears by"|FALSE
15707|"their difficulty of injection, it was necessary for them to secrete their"|FALSE
15707|"fluids in a very dilute state; and, probably for the purpose of stimulating"|FALSE
15707|"them into action, a quantity of neutral salt is likewise secreted or formed"|FALSE
15707|"by the gland. This aqueous and saline part of all secreted fluids is again"|FALSE
15707|"reabsorbed into the habit. More than half of some secreted fluids is thus"|FALSE
15707|"imbibed from the reservoirs, into which they are poured; as in the urinary"|FALSE
15707|"bladder much more than half of what is secreted by the kidneys becomes"|FALSE
15707|"reabsorbed by the lymphatics, which are thickly dispersed around the neck"|FALSE
15707|"of the bladder. This seems to be the purpose of the urinary bladders of"|FALSE
15707|"fish, as otherwise such a receptacle for the urine could have been of no"|FALSE
15707|"use to an animal immersed in water."|FALSE
15707|"5. The idea of substances disagreeably acrid will also produce a quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of saliva in the mouth; as when we smell very putrid vapours, we are"|FALSE
15707|"induced to spit out our saliva, as if something disagreeable was actually"|FALSE
15707|"upon our palates."|FALSE
15707|"6. When disagreeable food in the stomach produces nausea, a flow of saliva"|FALSE
15707|"is excited in the mouth by association; as efforts to vomit are frequently"|FALSE
15707|"produced by disagreeable drugs in the mouth by the same kind of"|FALSE
15707|"association."|FALSE
15707|"7. A preternatural flow of saliva is likewise sometimes occasioned by a"|FALSE
15707|"disease of the voluntary power; for if we think about our saliva, and"|FALSE
15707|"determine not to swallow it, or not to spit it out, an exertion is produced"|FALSE
15707|"by the will, and more saliva is secreted against our wish; that is, by our"|FALSE
15707|"aversion, which bears the same analogy to desire, as pain does to pleasure;"|FALSE
15707|"as they are only modifications of the same disposition of the sensorium."|FALSE
15707|"See Class IV. 3. 2. 1."|FALSE
15707|"8. The quantity of saliva may also be increased beyond what is natural, by"|FALSE
15707|"the catenation of the motions of these glands with other motions, or"|FALSE
15707|"sensations, as by an extraneous body in the ear; of which I have known an"|FALSE
15707|"instance; or by the application of stizolobium, siliqua hirsuta, cowhage,"|FALSE
15707|"to the seat of the parotis, as some writers have affirmed."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The lacrymal gland drinks up a certain fluid from the circumfluent"|FALSE
15707|"blood, and pours it on the ball of the eye, on the upper part of the"|FALSE
15707|"external corner of the eyelids. Though it may perhaps be stimulated into"|FALSE
15707|"the performance of its natural action by the blood, which surrounds its"|FALSE
15707|"origin, or by some part of that heterogeneous fluid; yet as the tears"|FALSE
15707|"secreted by this gland are more wanted at some times than at others, its"|FALSE
15707|"secretion is variable, like that of the saliva above mentioned, and is"|FALSE
15707|"chiefly produced when its excretory duct is stimulated; for in our common"|FALSE
15707|"sleep there seems to be little or no secretion of tears; though they are"|FALSE
15707|"occasionally produced by our sensations in dreams."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when any extraneous material on the eye-ball, or the dryness of the"|FALSE
15707|"external covering of it, or the coldness of the air, or the acrimony of"|FALSE
15707|"some vapours, as of onions, stimulates the excretory duct of the lacrymal"|FALSE
15707|"gland, it discharges its contents upon the ball; a quicker secretion takes"|FALSE
15707|"place in the gland, and abundant tears succeed, to moisten, clean, and"|FALSE
15707|"lubricate the eye. These by frequent nictitation are diffused over the"|FALSE
15707|"whole ball, and as the external angle of the eye in winking is closed"|FALSE
15707|"sooner than the internal angle, the tears are gradually driven forwards,"|FALSE
15707|"and downwards from the lacrymal gland to the puncta lacrymalia."|FALSE
15707|"2. The lacrymal sack, with its puncta lacrymalia, and its nasal duct, is a"|FALSE
15707|"complete gland; and is singular in this respect, that it neither derives"|FALSE
15707|"its fluid from, nor disgorges it into the circulation. The simplicity of"|FALSE
15707|"the structure of this gland, and both the extremities of it being on the"|FALSE
15707|"surface of the body, makes it well worthy our minuter observation; as the"|FALSE
15707|"actions of more intricate and concealed glands may be better understood"|FALSE
15707|"from their analogy to this."|FALSE
15707|"3. This simple gland consists of two absorbing mouths, a belly, and an"|FALSE
15707|"excretory duct. As the tears are brought to the internal angle of the eye,"|FALSE
15707|"these two mouths drink them up, being stimulated into action by this fluid,"|FALSE
15707|"which they absorb. The belly of the gland, or lacrymal sack, is thus"|FALSE
15707|"filled, in which the saline part of the tears is absorbed, and when the"|FALSE
15707|"other end of the gland, or nasal duct, is stimulated by the dryness, or"|FALSE
15707|"pained by the coldness of the air, or affected by any acrimonious dust or"|FALSE
15707|"vapour in the nostrils, it is excited into action together with the sack,"|FALSE
15707|"and the tears are disgorged upon the membrane, which lines the nostrils;"|FALSE
15707|"where they serve a second purpose to moisten, clean, and lubricate, the"|FALSE
15707|"organ of smell."|FALSE
15707|"4. When the nasal duct of this gland is stimulated by any very acrid"|FALSE
15707|"material, as the powder of tobacco, or volatile spirits, it not only"|FALSE
15707|"disgorges the contents of its belly or receptacle (the lacrymal sack), and"|FALSE
15707|"absorbs hastily all the fluid, that is ready for it in the corner of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye; but by the association of its motions with those of the lacrymal"|FALSE
15707|"gland, it excites that also into increased action, and a large flow of"|FALSE
15707|"tears is poured into the eye."|FALSE
15707|"5. This nasal duct is likewise excited into strong action by sensitive"|FALSE
15707|"ideas, as in grief, or joy, and then also by its associations with the"|FALSE
15707|"lacrymal gland it produces a great flow of tears without any external"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus; as is more fully explained in Sect. XVI. 8. on Instinct."|FALSE
15707|"6. There are some, famous in the arts of exciting compassion, who are said"|FALSE
15707|"to have acquired a voluntary power of producing a flow of tears in the eye;"|FALSE
15707|"which, from what has been said in the section on Instinct above mentioned,"|FALSE
15707|"I should suspect, is performed by acquiring a voluntary power over the"|FALSE
15707|"action of this nasal duct."|FALSE
15707|"7. There is another circumstance well worthy our attention, that when by"|FALSE
15707|"any accident this nasal duct is obstructed, the lacrymal sack, which is the"|FALSE
15707|"belly or receptacle of this gland, by slight pressure of the finger is"|FALSE
15707|"enabled to disgorge its contents again into the eye; perhaps the bile in"|FALSE
15707|"the same manner, when the biliary ducts are obstructed, is returned into"|FALSE
15707|"the blood by the vessels which secrete it?"|FALSE
15707|"8. A very important though minute occurrence must here be observed, that"|FALSE
15707|"though the lacrymal gland is only excited into action, when we weep at a"|FALSE
15707|"distressful tale, by its association with this nasal duct, as is more fully"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XVI. 8; yet the quantity of tears secreted at once is"|FALSE
15707|"more than the puncta lacrymalia can readily absorb; which shews _that the"|FALSE
15707|"motions occasioned by associations are frequently more energetic than the"|FALSE
15707|"original motions, by which they were occasioned_. Which we shall have"|FALSE
15707|"occasion to mention hereafter, to illustrate, why pains frequently exist in"|FALSE
15707|"a part distant from the cause of them, as in the other end of the urethra,"|FALSE
15707|"when a stone stimulates the neck of the bladder. And why inflammations"|FALSE
15707|"frequently arise in parts distant from their cause, as the gutta rosea of"|FALSE
15707|"drinking people, from an inflamed liver."|FALSE
15707|"The inflammation of a part is generally preceded by a torpor or quiescence"|FALSE
15707|"of it; if this exists in any large congeries of glands, as in the liver, or"|FALSE
15707|"any membranous part, as the stomach, pain is produced and chilliness in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of the torpor of the vessels. In this situation sometimes an"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation of the parts succeeds the torpor; at other times a distant"|FALSE
15707|"more sensible part becomes inflamed; whose actions have previously been"|FALSE
15707|"associated with it; and the torpor of the first part ceases. This I"|FALSE
15707|"apprehend happens, when the gout of the foot succeeds a pain of the biliary"|FALSE
15707|"duct, or of the stomach. Lastly, it sometimes happens, that the pain of"|FALSE
15707|"torpor exists without any consequent inflammation of the affected part, or"|FALSE
15707|"of any distant part associated with it, as in the membranes about the"|FALSE
15707|"temple and eye-brows in hemicrania, and in those pains, which occasion"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions; if this happens to gouty people, when it affects the liver, I"|FALSE
15707|"suppose epileptic fits are produced; and, when it affects the stomach,"|FALSE
15707|"death is the consequence. In these cases the pulse is weak, and the"|FALSE

15707|"to the sensitive class of motions, for the pleasure of its taste induces"|FALSE
15707|"the muscles of the jaw into action; yet the deglutition of it when"|FALSE
15707|"masticated is generally, if not always, an irritative motion, occasioned by"|FALSE
15707|"the application of the food already masticated to the origin of the"|FALSE

15707|"in chewing the cud; and appears to the eye of any one, who attends to them,"|FALSE
15707|"whilst they are employed in this second mastication of their food."|FALSE
15707|"2. When our natural aliment arrives into the stomach, this organ is"|FALSE
15707|"simulated into its proper vermicular action; which beginning at the upper"|FALSE
15707|"orifice of it, and terminating at the lower one, gradually mixes together"|FALSE
15707|"and pushes forwards the digesting materials into the intestine beneath it."|FALSE
15707|"At the same time the glands, that supply the gastric juices, which are"|FALSE
15707|"necessary to promote the chemical part of the process of digestion, are"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated to discharge their contained fluids, and to separate a further"|FALSE
15707|"supply from the blood-vessels: and the lacteals or lymphatics, which open"|FALSE
15707|"their mouths into the stomach, are stimulated into action, and take up some"|FALSE
15707|"part of the digesting materials."|FALSE
15707|"3. The remainder of these digesting materials is carried forwards into the"|FALSE
15707|"upper intestines, and stimulates them into their peristaltic motion similar"|FALSE
15707|"to that of the stomach; which continues gradually to mix the changing"|FALSE
15707|"materials, and pass them along through the valve of the colon to the"|FALSE
15707|"excretory end of this great gland, the sphincter ani."|FALSE
15707|"The digesting materials produce a flow of bile, and of pancreatic juice, as"|FALSE
15707|"they pass along the duodenum, by stimulating the excretory ducts of the"|FALSE
15707|"liver and pancreas, which terminate in that intestine: and other branches"|FALSE
15707|"of the absorbent or lymphatic system, called lacteals, are excited to drink"|FALSE
15707|"up, as it passes, those parts of the digesting materials, that are proper"|FALSE
15707|"for their purpose, by its stimulus on their mouths."|FALSE
15707|"4. When the stomach and intestines are thus filled with their proper food,"|FALSE
15707|"not only the motions of the gastric glands, the pancreas, liver, and"|FALSE
15707|"lacteal vessels, are excited into action; but at the same time the whole"|FALSE
15707|"tribe of irritative motions are exerted with greater energy, a greater"|FALSE
15707|"degree of warmth, colour, plumpness, and moisture, is given to the skin"|FALSE
15707|"from the increased action of those glands called capillary vessels;"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable sensation is excited, the voluntary motions are less easily"|FALSE
15707|"exerted, and at length suspended; and sleep succeeds, unless it be"|FALSE
15707|"prevented by the stimulus of surrounding objects, or by voluntary exertion,"|FALSE
15707|"or by an acquired habit, which was originally produced by one or other of"|FALSE
15707|"these circumstances, as is explained in Sect. XXI. on Drunkenness."|FALSE
15707|"At this time also, as the blood-vessels become replete with chyle, more"|FALSE
15707|"urine is separated into the bladder, and less of it is reabsorbed; more"|FALSE
15707|"mucus poured into the cellular membranes, and less of it reabsorbed; the"|FALSE
15707|"pulse becomes fuller, and softer, and in general quicker. The reason why"|FALSE
15707|"less urine and cellular mucus is absorbed after a full meal with sufficient"|FALSE
15707|"drink is owing to the blood-vessels being fuller: hence one means to"|FALSE
15707|"promote absorption is to decrease the resistance by emptying the vessels by"|FALSE
15707|"venesection. From this decreased absorption the urine becomes pale as well"|FALSE
15707|"as copious, and the skin appears plump as well as florid."|FALSE
15707|"By daily repetition of these movements they all become connected together,"|FALSE
15707|"and make a diurnal circle of irritative action, and if one of this chain be"|FALSE
15707|"disturbed, the whole is liable to be put into disorder. See Sect. XX. on"|FALSE
15707|"Vertigo."|FALSE
15707|"5. When the stomach and intestines receive a quantity of food, whose"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus is greater than usual, all their motions, and those of the glands"|FALSE
15707|"and lymphatics, are stimulated into stronger action than usual, and perform"|FALSE
15707|"their offices with greater vigour and in less time: such are the effects of"|FALSE
15707|"certain quantities of spice or of vinous spirit."|FALSE
15707|"6. But if the quantity or duration of these stimuli are still further"|FALSE
15707|"increased, the stomach and throat are stimulated into a motion, whose"|FALSE
15707|"direction is contrary to the natural one above described; and they"|FALSE
15707|"regurgitate the materials, which they contain, instead of carrying them"|FALSE
15707|"forwards. This retrograde motion of the stomach may be compared to the"|FALSE
15707|"stretchings of wearied limbs the contrary way, and is well elucidated by"|FALSE
15707|"the following experiment. Look earnestly for a minute or two on an area an"|FALSE
15707|"inch square of pink silk, placed in a strong light, the eye becomes"|FALSE
15707|"fatigued, the colour becomes faint, and at length vanishes, for the"|FALSE
15707|"fatigued eye can no longer be stimulated into direct motions; then on"|FALSE
15707|"closing the eye a green spectrum will appear in it, which is a colour"|FALSE
15707|"directly contrary to pink, and which will appear and disappear repeatedly,"|FALSE
15707|"like the efforts in vomiting. See Section XXIX. 11."|FALSE
15707|"Hence all those drugs, which by their bitter or astringent stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"increase the action of the stomach, as camomile and white vitriol, if their"|FALSE
15707|"quantity is increased above a certain dose become emetics."|FALSE
15707|"These inverted motions of the stomach and throat are generally produced"|FALSE
15707|"from the stimulus of unnatural food, and are attended with the sensation of"|FALSE
15707|"nausea or sickness: but as this sensation is again connected with an idea"|FALSE
15707|"of the distasteful food, which induced it; so an idea of nauseous food will"|FALSE
15707|"also sometimes excite the action of nausea; and that give rise by"|FALSE
15707|"association to the inversion of the motions of the stomach and throat. As"|FALSE
15707|"some, who have had horse-flesh or dogs-flesh given them for beef or mutton,"|FALSE
15707|"are said to have vomited many hours afterwards, when they have been told of"|FALSE
15707|"the imposition."|FALSE
15707|"I have been told of a person, who had gained a voluntary command over these"|FALSE
15707|"inverted motions of the stomach and throat, and supported himself by"|FALSE
15707|"exhibiting this curiosity to the public. At these exhibitions he swallowed"|FALSE
15707|"a pint of red rough gooseberries, and a pint of white smooth ones, brought"|FALSE
15707|"them up in small parcels into his mouth, and restored them separately to"|FALSE
15707|"the spectators, who called for red or white as they pleased, till the whole"|FALSE
15707|"were redelivered."|FALSE
15707|"7. At the same time that these motions of the stomach and throat are"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated into inversion, some of the other irritative motions, that had"|FALSE
15707|"acquired more immediate connexions with the stomach, as those of the"|FALSE
15707|"gastric glands, are excited into stronger action by this association; and"|FALSE
15707|"some other of these motions, which are more easily excited, as those of the"|FALSE
15707|"gastric lymphatics, are inverted by their association with the retrograde"|FALSE
15707|"motions of the stomach, and regurgitate their contents, and thus a greater"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of mucus, and of lymph, or chyle, is poured into the stomach, and"|FALSE
15707|"thrown up along with its contents."|FALSE
15707|"8. These inversions of the motion of the stomach in vomiting are performed"|FALSE
15707|"by intervals, for the same reason that many other motions are reciprocally"|FALSE
15707|"exerted and relaxed; for during the time of exertion the stimulus, or"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, which caused this exertion, is not perceived; but begins to be"|FALSE
15707|"perceived again, as soon as the exertion ceases, and is some time in again"|FALSE
15707|"producing its effect. As explained in Sect. XXXIV. on Volition, where it is"|FALSE
15707|"shewn, that the contractions of the fibres, and the sensation of pain,"|FALSE
15707|"which occasioned that exertion, cannot exist at the same time. The exertion"|FALSE
15707|"ceases from another cause also, which is the exhaustion of the sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power of the part, and these two causes frequently operate together."|FALSE
15707|"9. At the times of these inverted efforts of the stomach not only the"|FALSE
15707|"lymphatics, which open their mouths into the stomach, but those of the skin"|FALSE
15707|"also, are for a time inverted; for sweats are sometimes pushed out during"|FALSE
15707|"the efforts of vomiting without an increase of heat."|FALSE
15707|"10. But if by a greater stimulus the motions of the stomach are inverted"|FALSE
15707|"still more violently or more permanently, the duodenum has its peristaltic"|FALSE
15707|"motions inverted at the same time by their association with those of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach; and the bile and pancreatic juice, which it contains, are by the"|FALSE
15707|"inverted motions brought up into the stomach, and discharged along with its"|FALSE
15707|"contents; while a greater quantity of bile and pancreatic juice is poured"|FALSE
15707|"into this intestine; as the glands, that secrete them, are by their"|FALSE
15707|"association with the motions of the intestine excited into stronger action"|FALSE
15707|"than usual."|FALSE
15707|"11. The other intestines are by association excited into more powerful"|FALSE
15707|"action, while the lymphatics, that open their mouths into them, suffer an"|FALSE
15707|"inversion of their motions corresponding with the lymphatics of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, and duodenum; which with a part of the abundant secretion of bile"|FALSE
15707|"is carried downwards, and contributes both to stimulate the bowels, and to"|FALSE
15707|"increase the quantity of the evacuations. This inversion of the motion of"|FALSE
15707|"the lymphatics appears from the quantity of chyle, which comes away by"|FALSE
15707|"stools; which is otherwise absorbed as soon as produced, and by the immense"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of thin fluid, which is evacuated along with it."|FALSE
15707|"12. But if the stimulus, which inverts the stomach, be still more powerful,"|FALSE
15707|"or more permanent, it sometimes happens, that the motions of the biliary"|FALSE
15707|"glands, and of their excretory ducts, are at the same time inverted, and"|FALSE
15707|"regurgitate their contained bile into the blood-vessels, as appears by the"|FALSE
15707|"yellow colour of the skin, and of the urine; and it is probable the"|FALSE
15707|"pancreatic secretion may suffer an inversion at the same time, though we"|FALSE
15707|"have yet no mark by which this can be ascertained."|FALSE
15707|"13. Mr. ---- eat two putrid pigeons out of a cold pigeon-pye, and drank"|FALSE
15707|"about a pint of beer and ale along with them, and immediately rode about"|FALSE
15707|"five miles. He was then seized with vomiting, which was after a few periods"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded by purging; these continued alternately for two hours; and the"|FALSE
15707|"purging continued by intervals for six or eight hours longer. During this"|FALSE
15707|"time he could not force himself to drink more than one pint in the whole;"|FALSE
15707|"this great inability to drink was owing to the nausea, or inverted motions"|FALSE
15707|"of the stomach, which the voluntary exertion of swallowing could seldom and"|FALSE
15707|"with difficulty overcome; yet he discharged in the whole at least six"|FALSE
15707|"quarts; whence came this quantity of liquid? First, the contents of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach were emitted, then of the duodenum, gall-bladder, and pancreas, by"|FALSE
15707|"vomiting. After this the contents of the lower bowels, then the chyle, that"|FALSE
15707|"was in the lacteal vessels, and in the receptacle of chyle, was"|FALSE
15707|"regurgitated into the intestines by a retrograde motion of these vessels."|FALSE
15707|"And afterwards the mucus deposited in the cellular membrane, and on the"|FALSE
15707|"surface of all the other membranes, seems to have been absorbed; and with"|FALSE
15707|"the fluid absorbed from the air to have been carried up their respective"|FALSE
15707|"lymphatic branches by the increased energy of their natural motions, and"|FALSE
15707|"down the visceral lymphatics, or lacteals, by the inversion of their"|FALSE
15707|"motions."|FALSE
15707|"14. It may be difficult to invent experiments to demonstrate the truth of"|FALSE
15707|"this inversion of some branches of the absorbent system, and increased"|FALSE
15707|"absorption of others, but the analogy of these vessels to the intestinal"|FALSE
15707|"canal, and the symptoms of many diseases, render this opinion more probable"|FALSE
15707|"than many other received opinions of the animal oeconomy."|FALSE
15707|"In the above instance, after the yellow excrement was voided, the fluid"|FALSE
15707|"ceased to have any smell, and appeared like curdled milk, and then a"|FALSE
15707|"thinner fluid, and some mucus, were evacuated; did not these seem to"|FALSE
15707|"partake of the chyle, of the mucous fluid from all the cells of the body,"|FALSE
15707|"and lastly, of the atmospheric moisture? All these facts may be easily"|FALSE
15707|"observed by any one, who takes a brisk purge."|FALSE
15707|"15. Where the stimulus on the stomach, or on some other part of the"|FALSE
15707|"intestinal canal, is still more permanent, not only the lacteal vessels,"|FALSE
15707|"but the whole canal itself, becomes inverted from its associations: this is"|FALSE
15707|"the iliac passion, in which all the fluids mentioned above are thrown up by"|FALSE
15707|"the mouth. At this time the valve in the colon, from the inverted motions"|FALSE
15707|"of that bowel, and the inverted action of this living valve, does not"|FALSE
15707|"prevent the regurgitation of its contents."|FALSE
15707|"The structure of this valve may be represented by a flexile leathern pipe"|FALSE
15707|"standing up from the bottom of a vessel of water: its sides collapse by the"|FALSE
15707|"pressure of the ambient fluid, as a small part of that fluid passes through"|FALSE
15707|"it; but if it has a living power, and by its inverted action keeps itself"|FALSE
15707|"open, it becomes like a rigid pipe, and will admit the whole liquid to"|FALSE
15707|"pass. See Sect. XXIX. 2. 5."|FALSE
15707|"In this case the patient is averse to drink, from the constant inversion of"|FALSE
15707|"the motions of the stomach, and yet many quarts are daily ejected from the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, which at length smell of excrement, and at last seem to be only a"|FALSE
15707|"thin mucilaginous or aqueous liquor."|FALSE
15707|"From whence is it possible, that this great quantity of fluid for many"|FALSE
15707|"successive days can be supplied, after the cells of the body have given up"|FALSE
15707|"their fluids, but from the atmosphere? When the cutaneous branch of"|FALSE
15707|"absorbents acts with unnatural strength, it is probable the intestinal"|FALSE
15707|"branch has its motions inverted, and thus a fluid is supplied without"|FALSE
15707|"entering the arterial system. Could oiling or painting the skin give a"|FALSE
15707|"check to this disease?"|FALSE
15707|"So when the stomach has its motions inverted, the lymphatics of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, which are most strictly associated with it, invert their motions"|FALSE
15707|"at the same time. But the more distant branches of lymphatics, which are"|FALSE
15707|"less strictly associated with it, act with increased energy; as the"|FALSE
15707|"cutaneous lymphatics in the cholera, or iliac passion, above described. And"|FALSE
15707|"other irritative motions become decreased, as the pulsations of the"|FALSE
15707|"arteries, from the extra-derivation or exhaustion of the sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"Sometimes when stronger vomiting takes place the more distant branches of"|FALSE
15707|"the lymphatic system invert their motions with those of the stomach, and"|FALSE
15707|"loose stools are produced, and cold sweats."|FALSE
15707|"So when the lacteals have their motions inverted, as during the operation"|FALSE
15707|"of strong purges, the urinary and cutaneous absorbents have their motions"|FALSE
15707|"increased to supply the want of fluid in the blood, as in great thirst; but"|FALSE
15707|"after a meal with sufficient potation the urine is pale, that is, the"|FALSE
15707|"urinary absorbents act weakly, no supply of water being wanted for the"|FALSE
15707|"blood. And when the intestinal absorbents act too violently, as when too"|FALSE
15707|"great quantities of fluid have been drank, the urinary absorbents invert"|FALSE
15707|"their motions to carry off the superfluity, which is a new circumstance of"|FALSE
15707|"association, and a temporary diabetes supervenes."|FALSE
15707|"16. I have had the opportunity of seeing four patients in the iliac"|FALSE
15707|"passion, where the ejected material smelled and looked like excrement. Two"|FALSE
15707|"of these were so exhausted at the time I saw them, that more blood could"|FALSE
15707|"not be taken from them, and as their pain had ceased, and they continued to"|FALSE
15707|"vomit up every thing which they drank, I suspected that a mortification of"|FALSE
15707|"the bowel had already taken place, and as they were both women advanced in"|FALSE
15707|"life, and a mortification is produced with less preceding pain in old and"|FALSE
15707|"weak people, these both died. The other two, who were both young men, had"|FALSE
15707|"still pain and strength sufficient for further venesection, and they"|FALSE
15707|"neither of them had any appearance of hernia, both recovered by repeated"|FALSE
15707|"bleeding, and a scruple of calomel given to one, and half a dram to the"|FALSE
15707|"other, in very small pills: the usual means of clysters, and purges joined"|FALSE
15707|"with opiates, had been in vain attempted. I have thought an ounce or two of"|FALSE
15707|"crude mercury in less violent diseases of this kind has been of use, by"|FALSE
15707|"contributing to restore its natural motion to some part of the intestinal"|FALSE
15707|"canal, either by its weight or stimulus; and that hence the whole tube"|FALSE
15707|"recovered its usual associations of progressive peristaltic motion. I have"|FALSE
15707|"in three cases seen crude mercury given in small doses, as one or two"|FALSE
15707|"ounces twice a day, have great effect in stopping pertinacious vomitings."|FALSE
15707|"17. Besides the affections above described, the stomach is liable, like"|FALSE
15707|"many other membranes of the body, to torpor without consequent"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation: as happens to the membranes about the head in some cases of"|FALSE
15707|"hemicrania, or in general head-ach. This torpor of the stomach is attended"|FALSE
15707|"with indigestion, and consequent flatulency, and with pain, which is"|FALSE
15707|"usually called the cramp of the stomach, and is relievable by aromatics,"|FALSE
15707|"essential oils, alcohol, or opium."|FALSE
15707|"The intrusion of a gall-stone into the common bile-duct from the"|FALSE
15707|"gall-bladder is sometimes mistaken for a pain of the stomach, as neither of"|FALSE
15707|"them are attended with fever; but in the passage of a gall-stone, the pain"|FALSE
15707|"is confined to a less space, which is exactly where the common bile-duct"|FALSE
15707|"enters the duodenum, as explained in Section XXX. 1. 3. Whereas in this"|FALSE
15707|"gastrodynia the pain is diffused over the whole stomach; and, like other"|FALSE
15707|"diseases from torpor, the pulse is weaker, and the extremities colder, and"|FALSE
15707|"the general debility greater, than in the passage of a gall-stone; for in"|FALSE
15707|"the former the debility is the consequence of the pain, in the latter it is"|FALSE
15707|"the cause of it."|FALSE
15707|"Though the first fits of the gout, I believe, commence with a torpor of the"|FALSE
15707|"liver; and the ball of the toe becomes inflamed instead of the membranes of"|FALSE
15707|"the liver in consequence of this torpor, as a coryza or catarrh frequently"|FALSE
15707|"succeeds a long exposure of the feet to cold, as in snow, or on a moist"|FALSE
15707|"brick-floor; yet in old or exhausted constitutions, which have been long"|FALSE
15707|"habituated to its attacks, it sometimes commences with a torpor of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, and is transferable to every membrane of the body. When the gout"|FALSE
15707|"begins with torpor of the stomach, a painful sensation of cold occurs,"|FALSE
15707|"which the patient compares to ice, with weak pulse, cold extremities, and"|FALSE
15707|"sickness; this in its slighter degree is relievable by spice, wine, or"|FALSE
15707|"opium; in its greater degree it is succeeded by sudden death, which is"|FALSE
15707|"owing to the sympathy of the stomach with the heart, as explained below."|FALSE
15707|"If the stomach becomes inflamed in consequence of this gouty torpor of it,"|FALSE
15707|"or in consequence of its sympathy with some other part, the danger is less."|FALSE
15707|"A sickness and vomiting continues many days, or even weeks, the stomach"|FALSE
15707|"rejecting every thing stimulant, even opium or alcohol, together with much"|FALSE
15707|"viscid mucus; till the inflammation at length ceases, as happens when other"|FALSE
15707|"membranes, as those of the joints, are the seat of gouty inflammation; as"|FALSE
15707|"observed in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8."|FALSE
15707|"The sympathy, or association of motions, between those of the stomach and"|FALSE
15707|"those of the heart, are evinced in many diseases. First, many people are"|FALSE
15707|"occasionally affected with an intermission of their pulse for a few days,"|FALSE
15707|"which then ceases again. In this case there is a stop of the motion of the"|FALSE
15707|"heart, and at the same time a tendency to eructation from the stomach. As"|FALSE
15707|"soon as the patient feels a tendency to the intermission of the motion of"|FALSE
15707|"his heart, if he voluntarily brings up wind from his stomach, the stop of"|FALSE
15707|"the heart does not occur. From hence I conclude that the stop of digestion"|FALSE

15707|"aliment, which begins to ferment, if the digestive process is impeded for a"|FALSE
15707|"moment, (see Sect. XXIII. 4.); and that the stop of the heart is in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of the association of the motions of these viscera, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XXXV. 1. 4.; but if the little air, which is instantly"|FALSE
15707|"generated during the temporary torpor of the stomach, be evacuated, the"|FALSE
15707|"digestion recommences, and the temporary torpor of the heart does not"|FALSE
15707|"follow. One patient, whom I lately saw, and who had been five or six days"|FALSE
15707|"much troubled with this intermission of a pulsation of his heart, and who"|FALSE
15707|"had hemicrania with some fever, was immediately relieved from them all by"|FALSE

15707|"    III. _Three kinds of rheumatism._"|FALSE
15707|"I. 1. The capillary-vessels are like all the other glands except the"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent system, inasmuch as they receive blood from the arteries,"|FALSE
15707|"separate a fluid from it, and return the remainder by the veins."|FALSE
15707|"2. This series of glands is of the most extensive use, as their excretory"|FALSE
15707|"ducts open on the whole external skin forming its perspirative pores, and"|FALSE
15707|"on the internal surfaces of every cavity of the body. Their secretion on"|FALSE
15707|"the skin is termed insensible perspiration, which in health is in part"|FALSE
15707|"reabsorbed by the mouths of the lymphatics, and in part evaporated in the"|FALSE
15707|"air; the secretion on the membranes, which line the larger cavities of the"|FALSE
15707|"body, which have external openings, as the mouth and intestinal canal, is"|FALSE
15707|"termed mucus, but is not however coagulable by heat; and the secretion on"|FALSE
15707|"the membranes of those cavities of the body, which have no external"|FALSE
15707|"openings, is called lymph or water, as in the cavities of the cellular"|FALSE
15707|"membrane, and of the abdomen; this lymph however is coagulable by the heat"|FALSE
15707|"of boiling water. Some mucus nearly as viscid as the white of egg, which"|FALSE
15707|"was discharged by stool, did not coagulate, though I evaporated it to one"|FALSE
15707|"fourth of the quantity, nor did the aqueous and vitreous humours of a"|FALSE
15707|"sheep's eye coagulate by the like experiment: but the serosity from an"|FALSE
15707|"anasarcous leg, and that from the abdomen of a dropsical person, and the"|FALSE
15707|"crystalline humour of a sheep's eye, coagulated in the same heat."|FALSE
15707|"3. When any of these capillary glands are stimulated into greater"|FALSE
15707|"irritative actions, than is natural, they secrete a more copious material;"|FALSE
15707|"and as the mouths of the absorbent system, which open in their vicinity,"|FALSE
15707|"are at the same time stimulated into greater action, the thinner and more"|FALSE
15707|"saline part of the secreted fluid is taken up again; and the remainder is"|FALSE
15707|"not only more copious but also more viscid than natural. This is more or"|FALSE
15707|"less troublesome or noxious according to the importance of the functions of"|FALSE
15707|"the part affected: on the skin and bronchiæ, where this secretion ought"|FALSE
15707|"naturally to evaporate, it becomes so viscid as to adhere to the membrane;"|FALSE
15707|"on the tongue it forms a pellicle, which can with difficulty be scraped"|FALSE
15707|"off; produces the scurf on the heads of many people; and the mucus, which"|FALSE
15707|"is spit up by others in coughing. On the nostrils and fauces, when the"|FALSE
15707|"secretion of these capillary glands is increased, it is termed simple"|FALSE
15707|"catarrh; when in the intestines, a mucous diarrhoea; and in the urethra, or"|FALSE
15707|"vagina, it has the name of gonorrhoea, or fluor albus."|FALSE
15707|"4. When these capillary glands become inflamed, a still more viscid or even"|FALSE
15707|"cretaceous humour is produced upon the surfaces of the membranes, which is"|FALSE
15707|"the cause or the effect of rheumatism, gout, leprosy, and of hard tumours"|FALSE
15707|"of the legs, which are generally termed scorbutic; all which will be"|FALSE
15707|"treated of hereafter."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The whole surface of the body, with all its cavities and contents,"|FALSE
15707|"are covered with membrane. It lines every vessel, forms every cell, and"|FALSE
15707|"binds together all the muscular and perhaps the osseous fibres of the body;"|FALSE
15707|"and is itself therefore probably a simpler substance than those fibres. And"|FALSE
15707|"as the containing vessels of the body from the largest to the least are"|FALSE
15707|"thus lined and connected with membranes, it follows that these membranes"|FALSE
15707|"themselves consisted of unorganized materials."|FALSE
15707|"For however small we may conceive the diameters of the minutest vessels of"|FALSE
15707|"the body, which escape our eyes and glasses, yet these vessels must consist"|FALSE
15707|"of coats or sides, which are made up of an unorganized material, and which"|FALSE
15707|"are probably produced from a gluten, which hardens after its production,"|FALSE
15707|"like the silk or web of caterpillars and spiders. Of this material consist"|FALSE
15707|"the membranes, which line the shells of eggs, and the shell itself, both"|FALSE
15707|"which are unorganized, and are formed from mucus, which hardens after it is"|FALSE
15707|"formed, either by the absorption of its more fluid part, or by its uniting"|FALSE
15707|"with some part of the atmosphere. Such is also the production of the shells"|FALSE
15707|"of snails, and of shell-fish, and I suppose of the enamel of the teeth."|FALSE
15707|"2. But though the membranes, that compose the sides of the most minute"|FALSE
15707|"vessels, are in truth unorganized materials, yet the larger membranes,"|FALSE
15707|"which are perceptible to the eye, seem to be composed of an intertexture of"|FALSE
15707|"the mouths of the absorbent system, and of the excretory ducts of the"|FALSE
15707|"capillaries, with their concomitant arteries, veins, and nerves: and from"|FALSE
15707|"this construction it is evident, that these membranes must possess great"|FALSE
15707|"irritability to peculiar stimuli, though they are incapable of any motions,"|FALSE
15707|"that are visible to the naked eye: and daily experience shews us, that in"|FALSE
15707|"their inflamed state they have the greatest sensibility to pain, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"pleurisy and paronychia."|FALSE
15707|"3. On all these membranes a mucilaginous or aqueous fluid is secreted,"|FALSE
15707|"which moistens and lubricates their surfaces, as was explained in Section"|FALSE
15707|"XXIII. 2. Some have doubted, whether this mucus is separated from the blood"|FALSE
15707|"by an appropriated set of glands, or exudes through the membranes, or is an"|FALSE
15707|"abrasion or destruction of the surface of the membrane itself, which is"|FALSE
15707|"continually repaired on the other side of it, but the great analogy between"|FALSE
15707|"the capillary vessels, and the other glands, countenances the former"|FALSE
15707|"opinion; and evinces, that these capillaries are the glands, that secrete"|FALSE
15707|"it; to which we must add, that the blood in passing these capillary vessels"|FALSE
15707|"undergoes a change in its colour from florid to purple, and gives out a"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of heat; from whence, as in other glands, we must conclude that"|FALSE
15707|"something is secreted from it."|FALSE
15707|"III. The seat of rheumatism is in the membranes, or upon them; but there"|FALSE
15707|"are three very distinct diseases, which commonly are confounded under this"|FALSE
15707|"name. First, when a membrane becomes affected with torpor, or inactivity of"|FALSE
15707|"the vessels which compose it, pain and coldness succeed, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"hemicrania, and other head-achs, which are generally termed nervous"|FALSE
15707|"rheumatism; they exist whether the part be at rest or in motion, and are"|FALSE
15707|"generally attended with other marks of debility."|FALSE
15707|"Another rheumatism is said to exist, when inflammation and swelling, as"|FALSE
15707|"well as pain, affect some of the membranes of the joints, as of the ancles,"|FALSE
15707|"wrists, knees, elbows, and sometimes of the ribs. This is accompanied with"|FALSE
15707|"fever, is analogous to pleurisy and other inflammations, and is termed the"|FALSE
15707|"acute rheumatism."|FALSE
15707|"A third disease is called chronic rheumatism, which is distinguished from"|FALSE
15707|"that first mentioned, as in this the pain only affects the patient during"|FALSE
15707|"the motion of the part, and from the second kind of rheumatism above"|FALSE
15707|"described, as it is not attended with quick pulse or inflammation. It is"|FALSE
15707|"generally believed to succeed the acute rheumatism of the same part, and"|FALSE
15707|"that some coagulable lymph, or cretaceous, or calculous material, has been"|FALSE
15707|"left on the membrane; which gives pain, when the muscles move over it, as"|FALSE
15707|"some extraneous body would do, which was too insoluble to be absorbed."|FALSE
15707|"Hence there is an analogy between this chronic rheumatism and the diseases"|FALSE
15707|"which produce gravel or gout-stones; and it may perhaps receive relief from"|FALSE
15707|"the same remedies, such as aerated sal soda."|FALSE

15707|"I. As the imbibing mouths of the absorbent system already described open on"|FALSE
15707|"the surface, and into the larger cavities of the body, so there is another"|FALSE
15707|"system of absorbent vessels, which are not commonly esteemed such, I mean"|FALSE
15707|"the veins, which take up the blood from the various glands and capillaries,"|FALSE
15707|"after their proper fluids or secretions have been separated from it."|FALSE
15707|"The veins resemble the other absorbent vessels; as the progression of their"|FALSE
15707|"contents is carried on in the same manner in both, they alike absorb their"|FALSE
15707|"appropriated fluids, and have valves to prevent its regurgitation by the"|FALSE
15707|"accidents of mechanical violence. This appears first, because there is no"|FALSE
15707|"pulsation in the very beginnings of the veins, as is seen by microscopes;"|FALSE
15707|"which must happen, if the blood was carried into them by the actions of the"|FALSE
15707|"arteries. For though the concurrence of various venous streams of blood"|FALSE
15707|"from different distances must prevent any pulsation in the larger branches,"|FALSE
15707|"yet in the very beginnings of all these branches a pulsation must"|FALSE
15707|"unavoidably exist, if the circulation in them was owing to the intermitted"|FALSE
15707|"force of the arteries. Secondly, the venous absorption of blood from the"|FALSE
15707|"penis, and from the teats of female animals after their erection, is still"|FALSE
15707|"more similar to the lymphatic absorption, as it is previously poured into"|FALSE
15707|"cells, where all arterial impulse must cease."|FALSE
15707|"There is an experiment, which seems to evince this venous absorption, which"|FALSE
15707|"consists in the external application of a stimulus to the lips, as of"|FALSE

15707|"of the veins by this stimulus are excited to absorb the blood faster, than"|FALSE
15707|"it can be supplied by the usual arterial exertion. See Sect. XXIII. 5."|FALSE
15707|"There are two kinds of hæmorrhages frequent in diseases, one is where the"|FALSE
15707|"glandular or capillary action is too powerfully exerted, and propels the"|FALSE
15707|"blood forwards more hastily, than the veins can absorb it; and the other"|FALSE
15707|"is, where the absorbent power of the veins is diminished, or a branch of"|FALSE

15707|"1. The former of these cases is known by the heat of the part, and the"|FALSE
15707|"general fever or inflammation that accompanies the hæmorrhage. An"|FALSE
15707|"hæmorrhage from the nose or from the lungs is sometimes a crisis of"|FALSE
15707|"inflammatory diseases, as of the hepatitis and gout, and generally ceases"|FALSE
15707|"spontaneously, when the vessels are considerably emptied. Sometimes the"|FALSE
15707|"hæmorrhage recurs by daily periods accompanying the hot fits of fever, and"|FALSE
15707|"ceasing in the cold fits, or in the intermissions; this is to be cured by"|FALSE
15707|"removing the febrile paroxysms, which will be treated of in their place."|FALSE
15707|"Otherwise it is cured by venesection, by the internal or external"|FALSE
15707|"preparations of lead, or by the application of cold, with an abstemious"|FALSE
15707|"diet, and diluting liquids, like other inflammations. Which by inducing a"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence on those glandular parts, that are affected, prevents a greater"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of blood from being protruded forwards, than the veins are capable"|FALSE
15707|"of absorbing."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. B---- had an hæmorrhage from his kidney, and parted with not less than"|FALSE
15707|"a pint of blood a day (by conjecture) along with his urine for above a"|FALSE
15707|"fortnight: venesections, mucilages, balsams, preparations of lead, the"|FALSE
15707|"bark, alum, and dragon's blood, opiates, with a large blister on his loins,"|FALSE
15707|"were separately tried, in large doses, to no purpose. He was then directed"|FALSE

15707|"being covered, and the hæmorrhage diminished at the first, and ceased at"|FALSE
15707|"the second immersion."|FALSE
15707|"In this case the external capillaries were rendered quiescent by the"|FALSE
15707|"coldness of the water, and thence a less quantity of blood was circulated"|FALSE
15707|"through them; and the internal capillaries, or other glands, became"|FALSE
15707|"quiescent from their irritative associations with the external ones; and"|FALSE
15707|"the hæmorrhage was stopped a sufficient time for the ruptured vessels to"|FALSE
15707|"contract their apertures, or for the blood in those apertures to coagulate."|FALSE
15707|"Mrs. K---- had a continued haemorrhage from her nose for some days; the"|FALSE
15707|"ruptured vessel was not to be reached by plugs up the nostrils, and the"|FALSE
15707|"sensibility of her fauces was such that nothing could be born behind the"|FALSE
15707|"uvula. After repeated venesection, and other common applications, she was"|FALSE
15707|"directed to immerse her whole head into a pail of water, which was made"|FALSE
15707|"colder by the addition of several handfuls of salt, and the hæmorrhage"|FALSE
15707|"immediately ceased, and returned no more; but her pulse continued hard, and"|FALSE
15707|"she was necessitated to lose blood from the arm on the succeeding day."|FALSE
15707|"Query, might not the cold bath instantly stop hæmorrhages from the lungs in"|FALSE
15707|"inflammatory cases?--for the shortness of breath of those, who go suddenly"|FALSE
15707|"into cold water, is not owing to the accumulation of blood in the lungs,"|FALSE
15707|"but to the quiescence of the pulmonary capillaries from association, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Section XXXII. 3. 2."|FALSE
15707|"II. The other kind of hæmorrhage is known from its being attended with a"|FALSE
15707|"weak pulse, and other symptoms of general debility, and very frequently"|FALSE
15707|"occurs in those, who have diseased livers, owing to intemperance in the use"|FALSE
15707|"of fermented liquors. These constitutions are shewn to be liable to"|FALSE
15707|"paralysis of the lymphatic absorbents, producing the various kinds of"|FALSE
15707|"dropsies in Section XXIX. 5. Now if any branch of the venous system loses"|FALSE
15707|"its power of absorption, the part swells, and at length bursts and"|FALSE
15707|"discharges the blood, which the capillaries or other glands circulate"|FALSE
15707|"through them."|FALSE
15707|"It sometimes happens that the large external veins of the legs burst, and"|FALSE
15707|"effuse their blood; but this occurs most frequently in the veins of the"|FALSE
15707|"intestines, as the vena portarum is liable to suffer from a schirrus of the"|FALSE
15707|"liver opposing the progression of the blood, which is absorbed from the"|FALSE
15707|"intestines. Hence the piles are a symptom of hepatic obstruction, and hence"|FALSE
15707|"the copious discharges downwards or upwards of a black material, which has"|FALSE
15707|"been called melancholia, or black bile; but is no other than the blood,"|FALSE
15707|"which is probably discharged from the veins of the intestines."|FALSE
15707|"J.F. Meckel, in his Experimenta de Finibus Vasorum, published at Berlin,"|FALSE
15707|"1772, mentions his discovery of a communication of a lymphatic vessel with"|FALSE
15707|"the gastric branch of the vena portarum. It is possible, that when the"|FALSE
15707|"motion of the lymphatic becomes retrograde in some diseases, that blood may"|FALSE
15707|"obtain a passage into it, where it anastomoses with the vein, and thus be"|FALSE
15707|"poured into the intestines. A discharge of blood with the urine sometimes"|FALSE

15707|"the efforts of volition necessary. See Class I. 2. 1. 3. and Class III. 2."|FALSE
15707|"1. 12. Another species of pulmonary consumption which seems more certainly"|FALSE
15707|"of scrophulous origin is described in the next Section, No. 2."|FALSE
15707|"I have seen two cases of women, of about forty years of age, both of whom"|FALSE
15707|"were seized with quick weak pulse, with difficult respiration, and who spit"|FALSE
15707|"up by coughing much viscid mucus mixed with dark coloured blood. They had"|FALSE
15707|"both large vibices on their limbs, and petechiæ; in one the feet were in"|FALSE
15707|"danger of mortification, in the other the legs were oedematous. To relieve"|FALSE
15707|"the difficult respiration, about six ounces of blood were taken from one of"|FALSE
15707|"them, which to my surprise was sizy, like inflamed blood: they had both"|FALSE
15707|"palpitations or unequal pulsations of the heart. They continued four or"|FALSE
15707|"five weeks with pale and bloated countenances, and did not cease spitting"|FALSE
15707|"phlegm mixed with black blood, and the pulse seldom slower than 130 or 135"|FALSE
15707|"in a minute. This blood, from its dark colour, and from the many vibices"|FALSE
15707|"and petechiæ, seems to have been venous blood; the quickness of the pulse,"|FALSE
15707|"and the irregularity of the motion of the heart, are to be ascribed to"|FALSE
15707|"debility of that part of the system; as the extravasation of blood"|FALSE
15707|"originated from the defect of venous absorption. The approximation of these"|FALSE
15707|"two cases to sea-scurvy is peculiar, and may allow them to be called"|FALSE
15707|"scorbutus pulmonalis. Had these been younger subjects, and the paralysis of"|FALSE

15707|"Last week I saw a gentleman of Birmingham, who had for ten days laboured"|FALSE
15707|"under great palpitation of his heart, which was so distinctly felt by the"|FALSE

15707|"not lie down at all, and for about ten days past could not sleep a minute"|FALSE
15707|"together, but waked perpetually with great uneasiness. Could those symptoms"|FALSE
15707|"be owing to very extensive adhesions of the lungs? or is this a scorbutus"|FALSE

15707|"I. _Account of the Absorbent System._"|FALSE
15707|"1. The absorbent system of vessels in animal bodies consists of several"|FALSE

15707|"which they absorb."|FALSE
15707|"The intestinal absorbents open their mouths on the internal surfaces of the"|FALSE
15707|"intestines; their office is to drink up the chyle and the other fluids from"|FALSE
15707|"the alimentary canal; and they are termed lacteals, to distinguish them"|FALSE
15707|"from the other absorbent vessels, which have been termed lymphatics."|FALSE
15707|"Those, whose mouths are dispersed on the external skin, imbibe a great"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of water from the atmosphere, and a part of the perspirable"|FALSE
15707|"matter, which does not evaporate, and are termed cutaneous absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"Those, which arise from the internal surface of the bronchia, and which"|FALSE
15707|"imbibe moisture from the atmosphere, and a part of the bronchial mucus, are"|FALSE
15707|"called pulmonary absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"Those, which open their innumerable mouths into the cells of the whole"|FALSE
15707|"cellular membrane; and whose use is to take up the fluid, which is poured"|FALSE
15707|"into those cells, after it has done its office there; may be called"|FALSE
15707|"cellular absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"Those, which arise from the internal surfaces of the membranes, which line"|FALSE
15707|"the larger cavities of the body, as the thorax, abdomen, scrotum,"|FALSE
15707|"pericardium, take up the mucus poured into those cavities; and are"|FALSE
15707|"distinguished by the names of their respective cavities."|FALSE
15707|"Whilst those, which arise from the internal surfaces of the urinary"|FALSE
15707|"bladder, gall-bladder, salivary ducts, or other receptacles of secreted"|FALSE
15707|"fluids, may take their names from those fluids; the thinner parts of which"|FALSE
15707|"it is their office to absorb: as urinary, bilious, or salivary absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"2. Many of these absorbent vessels, both lacteals and lymphatics, like some"|FALSE
15707|"of the veins, are replete with valves: which seem designed to assist the"|FALSE
15707|"progress of their fluids, or at least to prevent their regurgitation; where"|FALSE
15707|"they are subjected to the intermitted pressure of the muscular, or arterial"|FALSE
15707|"actions in their neighbourhood."|FALSE
15707|"These valves do not however appear to be necessary to all the absorbents,"|FALSE
15707|"any more than to all the veins; since they are not found to exist in the"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent system of fish; according to the discoveries of the ingenious,"|FALSE
15707|"and much lamented Mr. Hewson. Philos. Trans. v. 59, Enquiries into the"|FALSE
15707|"Lymph. Syst. p. 94."|FALSE
15707|"3. These absorbent vessels are also furnished with glands, which are called"|FALSE
15707|"conglobate glands; whose use is not at present sufficiently investigated;"|FALSE
15707|"but it is probable that they resemble the conglomerate glands both in"|FALSE
15707|"structure and in use, except that their absorbent mouths are for the"|FALSE
15707|"conveniency of situation placed at a greater distance from the body of the"|FALSE
15707|"gland. The conglomerate glands open their mouths immediately into the"|FALSE
15707|"sanguiferous vessels, which bring the blood, from whence they absorb their"|FALSE
15707|"respective fluids, quite up to the gland: but these conglobate glands"|FALSE
15707|"collect their adapted fluids from very distant membranes, or cysts, by"|FALSE
15707|"means of mouths furnished with long necks for this purpose; and which are"|FALSE
15707|"called lacteals, or lymphatics."|FALSE
15707|"4. The fluids, thus collected from various parts of the body, pass by means"|FALSE
15707|"of the thoracic duct into the left subclavian near the jugular vein; except"|FALSE
15707|"indeed that those collected from the right side of the head and neck, and"|FALSE
15707|"from the right arm, are carried into the right subclavian vein: and"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes even the lymphatics from the right side of the lungs are inserted"|FALSE
15707|"into the right subclavian vein; whilst those of the left side of the head"|FALSE
15707|"open but just into the summit of the thoracic duct."|FALSE
15707|"5. In the absorbent system there are many anastomoses of the vessels, which"|FALSE
15707|"seem of great consequence to the preservation of health. These anastomoses"|FALSE
15707|"are discovered by dissection to be very frequent between the intestinal and"|FALSE
15707|"urinary lymphatics, as mentioned by Mr. Hewson, (Phil. Trans. v. 58.)"|FALSE
15707|"6. Nor do all the intestinal absorbents seem to terminate in the thoracic"|FALSE
15707|"duct, as appears from some curious experiments of D. Munro, who gave madder"|FALSE
15707|"to some animals, having previously put a ligature on the thoracic duct, and"|FALSE
15707|"found their bones, and the serum of their blood, coloured red."|FALSE
15707|"II. _The Valves of the Absorbent System may suffer their Fluids to"|FALSE
15707|"regurgitate in some Diseases._"|FALSE
15707|"1. The many valves, which occur in the progress of the lymphatic and"|FALSE
15707|"lacteal vessels, would seem insuperable obstacles to the regurgitation of"|FALSE
15707|"their contents. But as these valves are placed in vessels, which are indued"|FALSE
15707|"with life, and are themselves indued with life also; and are very irritable"|FALSE
15707|"into those natural motions, which absorb, or propel the fluids they"|FALSE
15707|"contain; it is possible, in some diseases, where these valves or vessels"|FALSE
15707|"are stimulated into unnatural exertions, or are become paralytic, that"|FALSE
15707|"during the diastole of the part of the vessel to which the valve is"|FALSE
15707|"attached, the valve may not so completely close, as to prevent the relapse"|FALSE
15707|"of the lymph or chyle. This is rendered more probable, by the experiments"|FALSE
15707|"of injecting mercury, or water, or suet, or by blowing air down these"|FALSE
15707|"vessels: all which pass the valves very easily, contrary to the natural"|FALSE
15707|"course of their fluids, when the vessels are thus a little forcibly"|FALSE
15707|"dilated, as mentioned by Dr. Haller, Elem. Physiol. t. iii. s. 4."|FALSE
15707|"\"The valves of the thoracic duct are few, some assert they are not more"|FALSE
15707|"than twelve, and that they do not very accurately perform their office, as"|FALSE
15707|"they do not close the whole area of the duct, and thence may permit chyle"|FALSE
15707|"to repass them downwards. In living animals, however, though not always,"|FALSE
15707|"yet more frequently than in the dead, they prevent the chyle from"|FALSE
15707|"returning. The principal of these valves is that, which presides over the"|FALSE
15707|"insertion of the thoracic duct, into the subclavian vein; many have"|FALSE
15707|"believed this also to perform the office of a valve, both to admit the"|FALSE
15707|"chyle into the vein, and to preclude the blood from entering the duct; but"|FALSE
15707|"in my opinion it is scarcely sufficient for this purpose.\" Haller, Elem."|FALSE
15707|"Phys. t. vii. p. 226."|FALSE
15707|"2. The mouths of the lymphatics seem to admit water to pass through them"|FALSE
15707|"after death, the inverted way, easier than the natural one; since an"|FALSE
15707|"inverted bladder readily lets out the water with which it is filled; whence"|FALSE
15707|"it may be inferred, that there is no obstacle at the mouths of these"|FALSE
15707|"vessels to prevent the regurgitation of their contained fluids."|FALSE
15707|"I was induced to repeat this experiment, and having accurately tied the"|FALSE
15707|"ureters and neck of a fresh ox's bladder, I made an opening at the fundus"|FALSE
15707|"of it; and then, having turned it inside outwards, filled it half full with"|FALSE
15707|"water, and was surprised to see it empty itself so hastily. I thought the"|FALSE
15707|"experiment more apposite to my purpose by suspending the bladder with its"|FALSE
15707|"neck downwards, as the lymphatics are chiefly spread upon this part of it,"|FALSE
15707|"as shewn by Dr. Watson, Philos. Trans. v. 59. p. 392."|FALSE
15707|"3. In some diseases, as in the diabetes and scrophula, it is probable the"|FALSE
15707|"valves themselves are diseased, and are thence incapable of preventing the"|FALSE
15707|"return of the fluids they should support. Thus the valves of the aorta"|FALSE
15707|"itself have frequently been found schirrous, according to the dissections"|FALSE
15707|"of Mons. Lieutaud, and have given rise to an interrupted pulse, and"|FALSE
15707|"laborious palpitations, by suffering a return of part of the blood into the"|FALSE
15707|"heart. Nor are any parts of the body so liable to schirrosity as the"|FALSE
15707|"lymphatic glands and vessels, insomuch that their schirrosities have"|FALSE
15707|"acquired a distinct name, and been termed scrophula."|FALSE
15707|"4. There are valves in other parts of the body, analogous to those of the"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent system, and which are liable, when diseased, to regurgitate their"|FALSE
15707|"contents: thus the upper and lower orifices of the stomach are closed by"|FALSE
15707|"valves, which, when too great quantities of warm water have been drank with"|FALSE
15707|"a design to promote vomiting, have sometimes resisted the utmost efforts of"|FALSE
15707|"the abdominal muscles, and diaphragm: yet, at other times, the upper valve,"|FALSE
15707|"or cardia, easily permits the evacuation of the contents of the stomach;"|FALSE
15707|"whilst the inferior valve, or pylorus, permits the bile, and other contents"|FALSE
15707|"of the duodenum, to regurgitate into the stomach."|FALSE
15707|"5. The valve of the colon is well adapted to prevent the retrograde motion"|FALSE
15707|"of the excrements; yet, as this valve is possessed of a living power, in"|FALSE
15707|"the iliac passion, either from spasm, or other unnatural exertions, it"|FALSE
15707|"keeps itself open, and either suffers or promotes the retrograde movements"|FALSE
15707|"of the contents of the intestines below; as in ruminating animals the mouth"|FALSE
15707|"of the first stomach seems to be so constructed, as to facilitate or assist"|FALSE
15707|"the regurgitation of the food; the rings of the oesophagus afterwards"|FALSE
15707|"contracting themselves in inverted order. De Haeu, by means of a syringe,"|FALSE
15707|"forced so much water into the rectum intestinum of a dog, that he vomited"|FALSE
15707|"it in a full stream from his mouth; and in the iliac passion above"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned, excrements and clyster are often evacuated by the mouth. See"|FALSE
15707|"Section XXV. 15."|FALSE
15707|"6. The puncta lacrymalia, with the lacrymal sack and nasal duct, compose a"|FALSE
15707|"complete gland, and much resemble the intestinal canal: the puncta"|FALSE
15707|"lacrymalia are absorbent mouths, that take up the tears from the eye, when"|FALSE
15707|"they have done their office there, and convey them into the nostrils; but"|FALSE
15707|"when the nasal duct is obstructed, and the lacrymal sack distended with its"|FALSE
15707|"fluid, on pressure with the finger the mouths of this gland (puncta"|FALSE
15707|"lacrymalia) will readily disgorge the fluid, they had previously absorbed,"|FALSE
15707|"back into the eye."|FALSE
15707|"7. As the capillary vessels receive blood from the arteries, and separating"|FALSE
15707|"the mucus, or perspirable matter from it, convey the remainder back by the"|FALSE
15707|"veins; these capillary vessels are a set of glands, in every respect"|FALSE
15707|"similar to the secretory vessels of the liver, or other large congeries of"|FALSE
15707|"glands. The beginnings of these capillary vessels have frequent anastomoses"|FALSE
15707|"into each other, in which circumstance they are resembled by the lacteals;"|FALSE
15707|"and like the mouths or beginnings of other glands, they are a set of"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent vessels, which drink up the blood which is brought to them by the"|FALSE
15707|"arteries, as the chyle is drank up by the lacteals: for the circulation of"|FALSE
15707|"the blood through the capillaries is proved to be independent of arterial"|FALSE
15707|"impulse; since in the blush of shame, and in partial inflammations, their"|FALSE
15707|"action is increased, without any increase of the motion of the heart."|FALSE
15707|"8. Yet not only the mouths, or beginnings of these anastomosing capillaries"|FALSE
15707|"are frequently seen by microscopes, to regurgitate some particles of blood,"|FALSE
15707|"during the struggles of the animal; but retrograde motion of the blood, in"|FALSE
15707|"the veins of those animals, from the very heart of the extremity of the"|FALSE
15707|"limbs, is observable, by intervals, during the distresses of the dying"|FALSE
15707|"creature. Haller, Elem. Physiol. t. i. p. 216. Now, as the veins have"|FALSE
15707|"perhaps all of them a valve somewhere between their extremities and the"|FALSE
15707|"heart, here is ocular demonstration of the fluids in this diseased"|FALSE
15707|"condition of the animal, repassing through venous valves: and it is hence"|FALSE
15707|"highly probable, from the strictest analogy, that if the course of the"|FALSE
15707|"fluids, in the lymphatic vessels, could be subjected to microscopic"|FALSE
15707|"observation, they would also, in the diseased state of the animal, be seen"|FALSE
15707|"to repass the valves, and the mouths of those vessels, which had previously"|FALSE
15707|"absorbed them, or promoted their progression."|FALSE
15707|"III. _Communication from the Alimentary Canal to the Bladder, by means of"|FALSE
15707|"the Absorbent Vessels._"|FALSE
15707|"Many medical philosophers, both ancient and modern, have suspected that"|FALSE
15707|"there was a nearer communication between the stomach and the urinary"|FALSE
15707|"bladder, than that of the circulation: they were led into this opinion from"|FALSE
15707|"the great expedition with which cold water, when drank to excess, passes"|FALSE
15707|"off by the bladder; and from the similarity of the urine, when produced in"|FALSE
15707|"this hasty manner, with the material that was drank."|FALSE
15707|"The former of these circumstances happens perpetually to those who drink"|FALSE

15707|"Before we endeavour to illustrate this doctrine, by describing the"|FALSE
15707|"phænomena of these diseases, we must premise one circumstance; that all the"|FALSE
15707|"branches of the lymphatic system have a certain sympathy with each other,"|FALSE
15707|"insomuch that when one branch is stimulated into unusual kinds or"|FALSE
15707|"quantities of motion, some other branch has its motions either increased,"|FALSE
15707|"or decreased, or inverted at the same time. This kind of sympathy can only"|FALSE
15707|"be proved by the concurrent testimony of numerous facts, which will be"|FALSE
15707|"related in the course of the work. I shall only add here, that it is"|FALSE
15707|"probable, that this sympathy does not depend on any communication of"|FALSE
15707|"nervous filaments, but on habit; owing to the various branches of this"|FALSE
15707|"system having frequently been stimulated into action at the same time."|FALSE
15707|"There are a thousand instances of involuntary motions associated in this"|FALSE
15707|"manner; as in the act of vomiting, while the motions of the stomach and"|FALSE
15707|"oesophagus are inverted, the pulsations of the arterial system by a certain"|FALSE
15707|"sympathy become weaker; and when the bowels or kidneys are stimulated by"|FALSE
15707|"poison, a stone, or inflammation, into more violent action; the stomach and"|FALSE
15707|"oesophagus by sympathy invert their motions."|FALSE
15707|"1. When any one drinks a moderate quantity of vinous spirit, the whole"|FALSE
15707|"system acts with more energy by consent with the stomach and intestines, as"|FALSE
15707|"is seen from the glow on the skin, and the increase of strength and"|FALSE
15707|"activity; but when a greater quantity of this inebriating material is"|FALSE
15707|"drank, at the same time that the lacteals are excited into greater action"|FALSE
15707|"to absorb it; it frequently happens, that the urinary branch of absorbents,"|FALSE
15707|"which is connected with the lacteals by many anastomoses, inverts its"|FALSE
15707|"motions, and a great quantity of pale unanimalized urine is discharged. By"|FALSE
15707|"this wise contrivance too much of an unnecessary fluid is prevented from"|FALSE
15707|"entering the circulation--This may be called the drunken diabetes, to"|FALSE
15707|"distinguish it from the other temporary diabetes, which occur in hysteric"|FALSE
15707|"diseases, and from continued fear or anxiety."|FALSE
15707|"2. If this idle ingurgitation of too much vinous spirit be daily practised,"|FALSE
15707|"the urinary branch of absorbents at length gains an habit of inverting its"|FALSE
15707|"motions, whenever the lacteals are much stimulated; and the whole or a"|FALSE
15707|"great part of the chyle is thus daily carried to the bladder without"|FALSE
15707|"entering the circulation, and the body becomes emaciated. This is one kind"|FALSE
15707|"of chronic diabetes, and may be distinguished from the others by the taste"|FALSE
15707|"and appearance of the urine; which is sweet, and the colour of whey, and"|FALSE
15707|"may be termed the chyliferous diabetes."|FALSE
15707|"3. Many children have a similar deposition of chyle in their urine, from"|FALSE
15707|"the irritation of worms in their intestines, which stimulating the mouths"|FALSE
15707|"of the lacteals into unnatural action, the urinary branch of the absorbents"|FALSE
15707|"becomes inverted, and carries part of the chyle to the bladder: part of the"|FALSE
15707|"chyle also has been carried to the iliac and lumbar glands, of which"|FALSE
15707|"instances are recorded by Haller, t. vii. 225. and which can be explained"|FALSE
15707|"on no other theory: but the dissections of the lymphatic system of the"|FALSE
15707|"human body, which have yet been published, are not sufficiently extensive"|FALSE
15707|"for our purpose; yet if we may reason from comparative anatomy, this"|FALSE
15707|"translation of chyle to the bladder is much illustrated by the account"|FALSE
15707|"given of this system of vessels in a turtle, by Mr. Hewson, who observed,"|FALSE
15707|"\"That the lacteals near the root of the mesentery anastomose, so as to form"|FALSE
15707|"a net-work, from which several large branches go into some considerable"|FALSE
15707|"lymphatics lying near the spine; and which can be traced almost to the"|FALSE
15707|"anus, and particularly to the kidneys.\" Philos. Trans. v. 59. p."|FALSE
15707|"199--Enquiries, p. 74."|FALSE
15707|"4. At the same time that the urinary branch of absorbents, in the beginning"|FALSE
15707|"of diabetes, is excited into inverted action, the cellular branch is"|FALSE
15707|"excited by the sympathy above mentioned, into more energetic action; and"|FALSE
15707|"the fat, that was before deposited, is reabsorbed and thrown into the blood"|FALSE
15707|"vessels; where it floats, and was mistaken for chyle, till the late"|FALSE
15707|"experiments of the ingenious Mr. Hewson demonstrated it to be fat."|FALSE
15707|"This appearance of what was mistaken for chyle in the blood, which was"|FALSE
15707|"drawn from these patients, and the obstructed liver, which very frequently"|FALSE
15707|"accompanies this disease, seems to have led Dr. Mead to suspect the"|FALSE
15707|"diabetes was owing to a defect of sanguification; and that the schirrosity"|FALSE
15707|"of the liver was the original cause of it: but as the schirrhus of the"|FALSE
15707|"liver is most frequently owing to the same causes, that produce the"|FALSE
15707|"diabetes and dropsies; namely, the great use of fermented liquors; there is"|FALSE
15707|"no wonder they should exist together, without being the consequence of each"|FALSE
15707|"other."|FALSE
15707|"5. If the cutaneous branch of absorbents gains a habit of being excited"|FALSE
15707|"into stronger action, and imbibes greater quantities of moisture from the"|FALSE
15707|"atmosphere, at the same time that the urinary branch has its motions"|FALSE
15707|"inverted, another kind of diabetes is formed, which may be termed the"|FALSE
15707|"aqueous diabetes. In this diabetes the cutaneous absorbents frequently"|FALSE
15707|"imbibe an amazing quantity of atmospheric moisture; insomuch that there are"|FALSE
15707|"authentic histories, where many gallons a day, for many weeks together,"|FALSE
15707|"above the quantity that has been drank, have been discharged by urine."|FALSE
15707|"Dr. Keil, in his Medicina Statica, found that he gained eighteen ounces"|FALSE
15707|"from the moist air of one night; and Dr. Percival affirms, that one of his"|FALSE
15707|"hands imbibed, after being well chafed, near an ounce and half of water, in"|FALSE
15707|"a quarter of an hour. (Transact. of the College, London, vol. ii. p. 102.)"|FALSE
15707|"Home's Medic. Facts, p. 2. sect. 3."|FALSE
15707|"The pale urine in hysterical women, or which is produced by fear or"|FALSE
15707|"anxiety, is a temporary complaint of this kind; and it would in reality be"|FALSE
15707|"the same disease, if it was confirmed by habit."|FALSE
15707|"6. The purging stools, and pale urine, occasioned by exposing the naked"|FALSE
15707|"body to cold air, or sprinkling it with cold water, originate from a"|FALSE
15707|"similar cause; for the mouths of the cutaneous lymphatics being suddenly"|FALSE
15707|"exposed to cold become torpid, and cease, or nearly cease, to act; whilst,"|FALSE
15707|"by the sympathy above described, not only the lymphatics of the bladder and"|FALSE
15707|"intestines cease also to absorb the more aqueous and saline part of the"|FALSE
15707|"fluids secreted into them; but it is probable that these lymphatics invert"|FALSE
15707|"their motions, and return the fluids, which were previously absorbed, into"|FALSE
15707|"the intestines and bladder. At the very instant that the body is exposed"|FALSE
15707|"naked to the cold air, an unusual movement is felt in the bowels; as is"|FALSE
15707|"experienced by boys going into the cold bath: this could not occur from an"|FALSE
15707|"obstruction of the perspirable matter, since there is not time, for that to"|FALSE
15707|"be returned to the bowels by the course of the circulation."|FALSE
15707|"There is also a chronic aqueous diarrhoea, in which the atmospheric"|FALSE
15707|"moisture, drank up by the cutaneous and pulmonary lymphatics, is poured"|FALSE
15707|"into the intestines, by the retrograde motions of the lacteals. This"|FALSE
15707|"disease is most similar to the aqueous diabetes, and is frequently"|FALSE
15707|"exchanged for it: a distinct instance of this is recorded by Benningerus,"|FALSE
15707|"Cent. v. Obs. 98. in which an aqueous diarrhoea succeeded an aqueous"|FALSE
15707|"diabetes, and destroyed the patient. There is a curious example of this,"|FALSE
15707|"described by Sympson (De Re Medica)--\"A young man (says he) was seized with"|FALSE
15707|"a fever, upon which a diarrhoea came on, with great stupor; and he refused"|FALSE
15707|"to drink any thing, though he was parched up with excessive heat: the"|FALSE
15707|"better to supply him with moisture, I directed his feet to be immersed in"|FALSE
15707|"cold water; immediately I observed a wonderful decrease of water in the"|FALSE
15707|"vessel, and then an impetuous stream of a fluid, scarcely coloured, was"|FALSE
15707|"discharged by stool, like a cataract.\""|FALSE
15707|"7. There is another kind of diarrhoea, which has been called cæliaca; in"|FALSE
15707|"this disease the chyle, drank up by the lacteals of the small intestines,"|FALSE
15707|"is probably poured into the large intestines, by the retrograde motions of"|FALSE
15707|"their lacteals: as in the chyliferous diabetes, the chyle is poured into"|FALSE
15707|"the bladder, by the retrograde motions of the urinary branch of absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"The chyliferous diabetes, like this chyliferous diarrhoea, produces sudden"|FALSE
15707|"atrophy; since the nourishment, which ought to supply the hourly waste of"|FALSE
15707|"the body, is expelled by the bladder, or rectum: whilst the aqueous"|FALSE
15707|"diabetes, and the aqueous diarrhoea produce excessive thirst; because the"|FALSE
15707|"moisture, which is obtained from the atmosphere, is not conveyed to the"|FALSE
15707|"thoracic receptacle, as it ought to be, but to the bladder, or lower"|FALSE
15707|"intestines; whence the chyle, blood, and whole system of glands, are robbed"|FALSE
15707|"of their proportion of humidity."|FALSE
15707|"8. There is a third species of diabetes, in which the urine is"|FALSE
15707|"mucilaginous, and appears ropy in pouring it from one vessel into another;"|FALSE
15707|"and will sometimes coagulate over the fire. This disease appears by"|FALSE
15707|"intervals, and ceases again, and seems to be occasioned by a previous"|FALSE
15707|"dropsy in some part of the body. When such a collection is reabsorbed, it"|FALSE
15707|"is not always returned into the circulation; but the same irritation that"|FALSE
15707|"stimulates one lymphatic branch to reabsorb the deposited fluid, inverts"|FALSE
15707|"the urinary branch, and pours it into the bladder. Hence this mucilaginous"|FALSE
15707|"diabetes is a cure, or the consequence of a cure, of a worse disease,"|FALSE
15707|"rather than a disease itself."|FALSE
15707|"Dr. Cotunnius gave half an ounce of cream of tartar, every morning, to a"|FALSE
15707|"patient, who had the anasarca; and he voided a great quantity of urine; a"|FALSE
15707|"part of which, put over the fire, coagulated, on the evaporation of half of"|FALSE
15707|"it, so as to look like the white of an egg. De Ischiade Nervos."|FALSE
15707|"This kind of diabetes frequently precedes a dropsy; and has this remarkable"|FALSE
15707|"circumstance attending it, that it generally happens in the night; as"|FALSE
15707|"during the recumbent state of the body, the fluid, that was accumulated in"|FALSE
15707|"the cellular membrane, or in the lungs, is more readily absorbed, as it is"|FALSE
15707|"less impeded by its gravity. I have seen more than one instance of this"|FALSE
15707|"disease. Mr. D. a man in the decline of life, who had long accustomed"|FALSE
15707|"himself to spirituous liquor, had swelled legs, and other symptoms of"|FALSE
15707|"approaching anasarca; about once in a week, or ten days, for several"|FALSE
15707|"months, he was seized, on going to bed, with great general uneasiness,"|FALSE
15707|"which his attendants resembled to an hysteric fit; and which terminated in"|FALSE
15707|"a great discharge of viscid urine; his legs became less swelled, and he"|FALSE
15707|"continued in better health for some days afterwards. I had not the"|FALSE
15707|"opportunity to try if this urine would coagulate over the fire, when part"|FALSE
15707|"of it was evaporated, which I imagine would be the criterion of this kind"|FALSE
15707|"of diabetes; as the mucilaginous fluid deposited in the cells and cysts of"|FALSE
15707|"the body, which have no communication with the external air, seems to"|FALSE
15707|"acquire, by stagnation, this property of coagulation by heat, which the"|FALSE
15707|"secreted mucus of the intestines and bladder do not appear to possess; as I"|FALSE
15707|"have found by experiment: and if any one should suppose this coagulable"|FALSE
15707|"urine was separated from the blood by the kidneys, he may recollect, that"|FALSE
15707|"in the most inflammatory diseases, in which the blood is most replete or"|FALSE
15707|"most ready to part with the coagulable lymph, none of this appears in the"|FALSE
15707|"urine."|FALSE
15707|"9. Different kinds of diabetes require different methods of cure. For the"|FALSE
15707|"first kind, or chyliferous diabetes, after clearing the stomach and"|FALSE
15707|"intestines, by ipecacuanha and rhubarb, to evacuate any acid material,"|FALSE
15707|"which may too powerfully stimulate the mouths of the lacteals, repeated and"|FALSE
15707|"large doses of tincture of cantharides have been much recommended. The"|FALSE
15707|"specific stimulus of this medicine, on the neck of the bladder, is likely"|FALSE
15707|"to excite the numerous absorbent vessels, which are spread on that part,"|FALSE
15707|"into stronger natural actions, and by that means prevent their retrograde"|FALSE
15707|"ones; till, by persisting in the use of the medicine, their natural habits"|FALSE
15707|"of motions might again be established. Another indication of cure, requires"|FALSE
15707|"such medicines, as by lining the intestines with mucilaginous substances,"|FALSE
15707|"or with such as consist of smooth particles, or which chemically destroy"|FALSE
15707|"the acrimony of their contents, may prevent the too great action of the"|FALSE
15707|"intestinal absorbents. For this purpose, I have found the earth"|FALSE
15707|"precipitated from a solution of alum, by means of fixed alcali, given in"|FALSE
15707|"the dose of half a dram every six hours, of great advantage, with a few"|FALSE
15707|"grains of rhubarb, so as to produce a daily evacuation."|FALSE
15707|"The food should consist of materials that have the least stimulus, with"|FALSE
15707|"calcareous water, as of Bristol and Matlock; that the mouths of the"|FALSE
15707|"lacteals may be as little stimulated as is necessary for their proper"|FALSE
15707|"absorption; lest with their greater exertions, should be connected by"|FALSE
15707|"sympathy, the inverted motions of the urinary lymphatics."|FALSE
15707|"The same method may be employed with equal advantage in the aqueous"|FALSE
15707|"diabetes, so great is the sympathy between the skin and the stomach. To"|FALSE
15707|"which, however, some application to the skin might be usefully added; as"|FALSE
15707|"rubbing the patient all over with oil, to prevent the too great action of"|FALSE
15707|"the cutaneous absorbents. I knew an experiment of this kind made upon one"|FALSE
15707|"patient with apparent advantage."|FALSE
15707|"The mucilaginous diabetes will require the same treatment, which is most"|FALSE
15707|"efficacious in the dropsy, and will be described below. I must add, that"|FALSE
15707|"the diet and medicines above mentioned, are strongly recommended by various"|FALSE
15707|"authors, as by Morgan, Willis, Harris, and Etmuller; but more histories of"|FALSE

15707|"When the cellular absorbents are become insensible to their usual"|FALSE
15707|"irritations, it most frequently happens, but not always, that the cutaneous"|FALSE

15707|"like inability. And then, as no water is absorbed from the atmosphere, the"|FALSE
15707|"urine is not only less diluted at the time of its secretion, and"|FALSE
15707|"consequently in less quantity and higher coloured: but great thirst is at"|FALSE

15707|"quantity, and of a deeper colour, and turbid like the yolk of an egg, owing"|FALSE
15707|"to a greater absorption of its thinner parts. From this stronger action of"|FALSE
15707|"those absorbents, which still retain their irritability, the fat is also"|FALSE
15707|"absorbed, and the whole body becomes emaciated. This increased exertion of"|FALSE
15707|"some branches of the lymphatics, while others are totally or partially"|FALSE
15707|"paralytic, is resembled by what constantly occurs in the hemiplagia; when"|FALSE

15707|"moving those of the other; for the moving power, not having access to the"|FALSE

15707|"The paucity of urine and thirst cannot be explained from a greater quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of mucilaginous fluid being deposited in the cellular membrane: for though"|FALSE
15707|"these symptoms have continued many weeks, or even months, this collection"|FALSE
15707|"frequently does not amount to more than very few pints. Hence also the"|FALSE
15707|"difficulty of promoting copious sweats in anasarca is accounted for, as"|FALSE
15707|"well as the great thirst, paucity of urine, and loss of fat; since, when"|FALSE
15707|"the cutaneous branch of absorbents is paralytic, or nearly so, there is"|FALSE

15707|"Hence likewise we understand, why in the ascites, and some other dropsies,"|FALSE
15707|"there is often no thirst, and no paucity of urine; in these cases the"|FALSE
15707|"cutaneous absorbents continue to do their office."|FALSE
15707|"Some have believed, that dropsies were occasioned by the inability of the"|FALSE
15707|"kidneys, from having only observed the paucity of urine; and have thence"|FALSE
15707|"laboured much to obtain diuretic medicines; but it is daily observable,"|FALSE
15707|"that those who die of a total inability to make water, do not become"|FALSE
15707|"dropsical in consequence of it: Fernelius mentions one, who laboured under"|FALSE

15707|"had no symptoms of dropsy. Pathol. 1. vi. c. 8. From the same idea many"|FALSE
15707|"physicians have restrained their patients from drinking, though their"|FALSE
15707|"thirst has been very urgent; and some cases have been published, where this"|FALSE
15707|"cruel regimen has been thought advantageous: but others of nicer"|FALSE
15707|"observation are of opinion, that it has always aggravated the distresses of"|FALSE
15707|"the patient; and though it has abated his swellings, yet by inducing a"|FALSE
15707|"fever it has hastened his dissolution. See Transactions of the College,"|FALSE

15707|"The cure of anasarca, so far as respects the evacuation of the accumulated"|FALSE
15707|"fluid, coincides with the idea of the retrograde action of the lymphatic"|FALSE
15707|"system. It is well known that vomits, and other drugs, which induce"|FALSE
15707|"sickness or nausea; at the same time that they evacuate the stomach,"|FALSE
15707|"produce a great absorption of the lymph accumulated in the cellular"|FALSE
15707|"membrane. In the operation of a vomit, not only the motions of the stomach"|FALSE
15707|"and duodenum become inverted, but also those of the lymphatics and"|FALSE
15707|"lacteals, which belong to them; whence a great quantity of chyle and lymph"|FALSE
15707|"is perpetually poured into the stomach and intestines, during the"|FALSE
15707|"operation, and evacuated by the mouth. Now at the same time, other branches"|FALSE
15707|"of the lymphatic system, viz. those which open on the cellular membrane,"|FALSE
15707|"are brought into more energetic action, by the sympathy above mentioned,"|FALSE
15707|"and an increase of their absorption is produced."|FALSE
15707|"Hence repeated vomits, and cupreous salts, and small doses of squill or"|FALSE
15707|"foxglove, are so efficacious in this disease. And as drastic purges act"|FALSE
15707|"also by inverting the motions of the lacteals; and thence the other"|FALSE
15707|"branches of lymphatics are induced into more powerful natural action, by"|FALSE
15707|"sympathy, and drink up the fluids from all the cells of the body; and by"|FALSE
15707|"their anastomoses, pour them into the lacteal branches; which, by their"|FALSE
15707|"inverted actions, return them into the intestines; and they are thus"|FALSE

15707|"VIII. _Circumstances by which the Fluids, that are effused by the"|FALSE

15707|"1. We frequently observe an unusual quantity of mucus or other fluids in"|FALSE
15707|"some diseases, although the action of the glands, by which those fluids are"|FALSE
15707|"separated from the blood, is not unusually increased; but when the power of"|FALSE
15707|"absorption alone is diminished. Thus the catarrhal humour from the nostrils"|FALSE
15707|"of some, who ride in frosty weather; and the tears, which run down the"|FALSE
15707|"cheeks of those, who have an obstruction of the puncta lacrymalia; and the"|FALSE
15707|"ichor of those phagedenic ulcers, which are not attended with inflammation,"|FALSE
15707|"are all instances of this circumstance."|FALSE
15707|"These fluids however are easily distinguished from others by their"|FALSE
15707|"abounding in ammoniacal or muriatic salts; whence they inflame the"|FALSE
15707|"circumjacent skin: thus in the catarrh the upper lip becomes red and"|FALSE
15707|"swelled from the acrimony of the mucus, and patients complain of the"|FALSE
15707|"saltness of its taste. The eyes and cheeks are red with the corrosive"|FALSE
15707|"tears, and the ichor of some herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide the"|FALSE
15707|"contiguous parts, and is pungently salt to the taste, as some patients have"|FALSE
15707|"informed me."|FALSE
15707|"Whilst, on the contrary, those fluids, which are effused by the retrograde"|FALSE
15707|"action of the lymphatics, are for the most part mild and innocent; as"|FALSE
15707|"water, chyle, and the natural mucus: or they take their properties from the"|FALSE
15707|"materials previously absorbed, as in the coloured or vinous urine, or that"|FALSE
15707|"scented with asparagus, described before."|FALSE
15707|"2. Whenever the secretion of any fluid is increased, there is at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time an increased heat in the part; for the secreted fluid, as the bile,"|FALSE
15707|"did not previously exist in the mass of blood, but a new combination is"|FALSE
15707|"produced in the gland. Now as solutions are attended with cold, so"|FALSE
15707|"combinations are attended with heat; and it is probable the sum of the heat"|FALSE
15707|"given out by all the secreted fluids of animal bodies may be the cause of"|FALSE
15707|"their general heat above that of the atmosphere."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the fluids derived from increased secretions are readily"|FALSE
15707|"distinguished from those originating from the retrograde motions of the"|FALSE
15707|"lymphatics: thus an increase of heat either in the diseased parts, or"|FALSE
15707|"diffused over the whole body, is perceptible, when copious bilious stools"|FALSE
15707|"are consequent to an inflamed liver; or a copious mucous salivation from"|FALSE
15707|"the inflammatory angina."|FALSE
15707|"3. When any secreted fluid is produced in an unusual quantity, and at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time the power of absorption is increased in equal proportion, not"|FALSE
15707|"only the heat of the gland becomes more intense, but the secreted fluid"|FALSE
15707|"becomes thicker and milder, its thinner and saline parts being re-absorbed:"|FALSE
15707|"and these are distinguishable both by their greater consistence, and by"|FALSE
15707|"their heat, from the fluids, which are effused by the retrograde motions of"|FALSE
15707|"the lymphatics; as is observable towards the termination of gonorrhoea,"|FALSE
15707|"catarrh, chincough, and in those ulcers, which are said to abound with"|FALSE
15707|"laudable pus."|FALSE
15707|"4. When chyle is observed in stools, or among the materials ejected by"|FALSE
15707|"vomit, we may be confident it must have been brought thither by the"|FALSE
15707|"retrograde motions of the lacteals; for chyle does not previously exist"|FALSE
15707|"amid the contents of the intestines, but is made in the very mouths of the"|FALSE
15707|"lacteals, as was before explained."|FALSE
15707|"5. When chyle, milk, or other extraneous fluids are found in the urinary"|FALSE
15707|"bladder, or in any other excretory receptacle of a gland; no one can for a"|FALSE
15707|"moment believe, that these have been collected from the mass of blood by a"|FALSE

15707|"philosophers held to be inferior animals, it may be a matter of curiosity"|FALSE
15707|"at least to observe, that their absorbent vessels seem evidently, at times,"|FALSE
15707|"to be capable of a retrograde motion. Mr. Perault cut off a forked branch"|FALSE
15707|"of a tree, with the leaves on; and inverting one of the forks into a vessel"|FALSE
15707|"of water, observed, that the leaves on the other branch continued green"|FALSE
15707|"much longer than those of a similar branch, cut off from the same tree;"|FALSE
15707|"which shews, that the water from the vessel was carried up one part of the"|FALSE
15707|"forked branch, by the retrograde motion of its vessels, and supplied"|FALSE
15707|"nutriment some time to the other part of the branch, which was out of the"|FALSE
15707|"water. And the celebrated Dr. Hales found, by numerous very accurate"|FALSE

15707|"Dr. Hope has also made this pleasing experiment, after the manner of"|FALSE
15707|"Hales--he has placed a forked branch, cut from one tree, erect between two"|FALSE

15707|"I then passed a ligature round several branches of lacteals, and irritated"|FALSE

15707|"those parts of the body, which have previously been exposed to too great a"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of such stimuli, as strongly affect them, become for some time"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards disobedient to the natural quantity of their adapted"|FALSE
15707|"stimuli.--Thus the eye is incapable of seeing objects in an obscure room,"|FALSE
15707|"though the iris is quite dilated, after having been exposed to the meridian"|FALSE
15707|"sun."|FALSE
15707|"3. There is a third law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies,"|FALSE
15707|"which have been lately subjected to less stimulus, than they have been"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed to, when they are exposed to their usual quantity of stimulus,"|FALSE
15707|"are excited into more energetic motions: thus when we come from a dusky"|FALSE
15707|"cavern into the glare of daylight, our eyes are dazzled; and after emerging"|FALSE
15707|"from the cold bath, the skin becomes warm and red."|FALSE
15707|"4. There is a fourth law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies,"|FALSE
15707|"which are subjected to still stronger stimuli for a length of time, become"|FALSE
15707|"torpid, and refuse to obey even these stronger stimuli; and thence do their"|FALSE
15707|"offices very imperfectly.--Thus, if any one looks earnestly for some"|FALSE
15707|"minutes on an area, an inch diameter, of red silk, placed on a sheet of"|FALSE
15707|"white paper, the image of the silk will gradually become pale, and at"|FALSE
15707|"length totally vanish."|FALSE
15707|"5. Nor is it the nerves of sense alone, as the optic and auditory nerves,"|FALSE
15707|"that thus become torpid, when the stimulus is withdrawn or their"|FALSE
15707|"irritability decreased; but the motive muscles, when they are deprived of"|FALSE
15707|"their natural stimuli, or of their irritability, become torpid and"|FALSE
15707|"paralytic; as is seen in the tremulous hand of the drunkard in a morning;"|FALSE
15707|"and in the awkward step of age."|FALSE
15707|"The hollow muscles also, of which the various vessels of the body are"|FALSE
15707|"constructed, when they are deprived of their natural stimuli, or of their"|FALSE
15707|"due degree of irritability, not only become tremulous, as the arterial"|FALSE
15707|"pulsations of dying people; but also frequently invert their motions, as in"|FALSE
15707|"vomiting, in hysteric suffocations, and diabetes above described."|FALSE
15707|"I must beg your patient attention, for a few moments whilst I endeavour to"|FALSE
15707|"explain, how the retrograde actions of our hollow muscles are the"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of their debility; as the tremulous actions of the solid"|FALSE
15707|"muscles are the consequence of their debility. When, through fatigue, a"|FALSE
15707|"muscle can act no longer; the antagonist muscles, either by their inanimate"|FALSE
15707|"elasticity, or by their animal action, draw the limb into a contrary"|FALSE
15707|"direction: in the solid muscles, as those of locomotion, their actions are"|FALSE
15707|"associated in tribes, which have been accustomed to synchronous action"|FALSE
15707|"only; hence when they are fatigued, only a single contrary effort takes"|FALSE
15707|"place; which is either tremulous, when the fatigued muscles are again"|FALSE
15707|"immediately brought into action; or it is a pandiculation, or stretching,"|FALSE
15707|"where they are not immediately again brought into action."|FALSE
15707|"Now the motions of the hollow muscles, as they in general propel a fluid"|FALSE
15707|"along their cavities, are associated in trains, which have been accustomed"|FALSE
15707|"to successive actions: hence when one ring of such a muscle is fatigued"|FALSE
15707|"from its too great debility, and is brought into retrograde action, the"|FALSE
15707|"next ring from its association falls successively into retrograde action;"|FALSE
15707|"and so on throughout the whole canal. See Sect. XXV. 6."|FALSE
15707|"6. But as the retrograde motions of the stomach, oesophagus, and fauces in"|FALSE
15707|"vomiting are, as it were, apparent to the eye; we shall consider this"|FALSE
15707|"operation more minutely, that the similar operations in the more recondite"|FALSE
15707|"parts of our system may be easier understood."|FALSE
15707|"From certain nauseous ideas of the mind, from an ungrateful taste in the"|FALSE
15707|"mouth, or from foetid smells, vomiting is sometimes instantly excited; or"|FALSE
15707|"even from a stroke on the head, or from the vibratory motions of a ship;"|FALSE
15707|"all which originate from association, or sympathy. See Sect. XX. on"|FALSE
15707|"Vertigo."|FALSE
15707|"But when the stomach is subjected to a less stimulus than is natural,"|FALSE
15707|"according to the first law of irritation mentioned above, its motions"|FALSE
15707|"become disturbed, as in hunger; first pain is produced, then sickness, and"|FALSE
15707|"at length vain efforts to vomit, as many authors inform us."|FALSE
15707|"But when a great quantity of wine, or of opium, is swallowed, the"|FALSE
15707|"retrograde motions of the stomach do not occur till after several minutes,"|FALSE
15707|"or even hours; for when the power of so strong a stimulus ceases, according"|FALSE
15707|"to the second law of irritation, mentioned above, the peristaltic motions"|FALSE
15707|"become tremulous, and at length retrograde; as is well known to the"|FALSE
15707|"drunkard, who on the next morning has sickness and vomitings."|FALSE
15707|"When a still greater quantity of wine, or of opium, or when nauseous"|FALSE
15707|"vegetables, or strong bitters, or metallic salts, are taken into the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, they quickly induce vomiting; though all these in less doses"|FALSE
15707|"excite the stomach into more energetic action, and strengthen the"|FALSE
15707|"digestion; as the flowers of chamomile, and the vitriol of zinc: for,"|FALSE
15707|"according to the fourth law of irritation, the stomach will not long be"|FALSE
15707|"obedient to a stimulus so much greater than is natural; but its action"|FALSE
15707|"becomes first tremulous and then retrograde."|FALSE
15707|"7. When the motions of any vessels become retrograde, less heat of the body"|FALSE
15707|"is produced; for in paroxysms of vomiting, of hysteric affections, of"|FALSE
15707|"diabetes, of asthma, the extremities of the body are cold: hence we may"|FALSE
15707|"conclude, that these symptoms arise from the debility of the parts in"|FALSE
15707|"action; for an increase of muscular action is always attended with increase"|FALSE
15707|"of heat."|FALSE
15707|"8. But as animal debility is owing to defect of stimulus, or to defect of"|FALSE
15707|"irritability, as shewn above, the method of cure is easily deduced: when"|FALSE
15707|"the vascular muscles are not excited into their due action by the natural"|FALSE
15707|"stimuli, we should exhibit those medicines, which possess a still greater"|FALSE
15707|"degree of stimulus; amongst these are the foetids, the volatiles,"|FALSE
15707|"aromatics, bitters, metallic salts, opiates, wine, which indeed should be"|FALSE
15707|"given in small doses, and frequently repeated. To these should be added"|FALSE
15707|"constant, but moderate exercise, cheerfulness of mind, and change of"|FALSE
15707|"country to a warmer climate; and perhaps occasionally the external stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"of blisters."|FALSE
15707|"It is also frequently useful to diminish the quantity of natural stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"for a short time, by which afterwards the irritability of the system"|FALSE
15707|"becomes increased; according to the third law of irritation"|FALSE
15707|"above-mentioned, hence the use of baths somewhat colder than animal heat,"|FALSE
15707|"and of equitation in the open air."|FALSE
15707|"_The catalogue of diseases owing to the retrograde motions of lymphatics is"|FALSE

15707|"Thus have I endeavoured in a concise manner to explain the numerous"|FALSE

15707|"stimulated into unnatural action, and a greater quantity of bile is"|FALSE
15707|"produced from all the secretory vessels of the liver, by the association of"|FALSE
15707|"their motions with those of their excretory ducts; as has been explained in"|FALSE
15707|"Section XXIV. and XXV. but as all parts of the body, that have been"|FALSE
15707|"affected with stronger stimuli for any length of time, become less"|FALSE
15707|"susceptible of motion, from their natural weaker stimuli, it follows, that"|FALSE
15707|"the motions of the secretory vessels, and in consequence the secretion of"|FALSE
15707|"bile, is less than is natural during the intervals of sobriety. 2. If this"|FALSE
15707|"ingurgitation of spirituous liquors has been daily continued in"|FALSE
15707|"considerable quantity, and is then suddenly intermitted, a languor or"|FALSE
15707|"paralysis of the common bile-duct is induced; the bile is prevented from"|FALSE
15707|"being poured into the intestines; and as the bilious absorbents are"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated into stronger action by its accumulation, and by the acrimony or"|FALSE
15707|"viscidity, which it acquires by delay, it is absorbed, and carried to the"|FALSE
15707|"receptacle of the chyle; or otherwise the secretory vessels of the liver,"|FALSE
15707|"by the above-mentioned stimulus, invert their motions, and regurgitate"|FALSE
15707|"their contents into the blood, as sometimes happens to the tears in the"|FALSE
15707|"lachrymal sack, see Sect. XXIV. 2. 7. and one kind of jaundice is brought"|FALSE
15707|"on."|FALSE
15707|"There is reason to believe, that the bile is most frequently returned into"|FALSE
15707|"the circulation by the inverted motions of these hepatic glands, for the"|FALSE
15707|"bile does not seem liable to be absorbed by the lymphatics, for it soaks"|FALSE
15707|"through the gall-ducts, and is frequently found in the cellular membrane."|FALSE
15707|"This kind of jaundice is not generally attended with pain, neither at the"|FALSE
15707|"extremity of the bile-duct, where it enters the duodenum, nor on the region"|FALSE
15707|"of the gall-bladder."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. S. a gentleman between 40 and 50 years of age, had had the jaundice"|FALSE
15707|"about six weeks, without pain, sickness, or fever; and had taken emetics,"|FALSE
15707|"cathartics, mercurials, bitters, chalybeates, essential oil, and ether,"|FALSE
15707|"without apparent advantage. On a supposition that the obstruction of the"|FALSE
15707|"bile might be owing to the paralysis, or torpid action of the common"|FALSE
15707|"bile-duct, and the stimulants taken into the stomach seeming to have no"|FALSE
15707|"effect, I directed half a score smart electric shocks from a coated bottle,"|FALSE
15707|"which held about a quart, to be passed through the liver, and along the"|FALSE
15707|"course of the common gall-duct, as near as could be guessed, and on that"|FALSE
15707|"very day the stools became yellow; he continued the electric shocks a few"|FALSE
15707|"days more, and his skin gradually became clear."|FALSE
15707|"3. The bilious vomiting and purging, that affects some people by intervals"|FALSE
15707|"of a few weeks, is a less degree of this disease; the bile-duct is less"|FALSE
15707|"irritable than natural, and hence the bile becomes accumulated in the"|FALSE
15707|"gall-bladder, and hepatic ducts, till by its quantity, acrimony or"|FALSE
15707|"viscidity, a greater degree of irritation is produced, and it is suddenly"|FALSE
15707|"evacuated, or lastly from the absorption of the more liquid parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"bile, the remainder becomes inspissated, and chrystallizes into masses too"|FALSE
15707|"large to pass, and forms another kind of jaundice, where the bile-duct is"|FALSE
15707|"not quite paralytic, or has regained its irritability."|FALSE
15707|"This disease is attended with much pain, which at first is felt at the pit"|FALSE
15707|"of the stomach, exactly in the centre of the body, where the bile-duct"|FALSE
15707|"enters the duodenum; afterwards, when the size of the bile-stones increase,"|FALSE
15707|"it is also felt on the right side, where the gall-bladder is situated. The"|FALSE
15707|"former pain at the pit of the stomach recurs by intervals, as the"|FALSE
15707|"bile-stone is pushed against the neck of the duct; like the paroxysms of"|FALSE
15707|"the stone in the urinary bladder, the other is a more dull and constant"|FALSE
15707|"pain."|FALSE
15707|"Where these bile-stones are too large to pass, and the bile-ducts possess"|FALSE
15707|"their sensibility, this becomes a very painful and hopeless disease. I made"|FALSE
15707|"the following experiments with a view to their chemical solution."|FALSE
15707|"Some fragments of the same bile-stone were put into the weak spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"marine salt, which is sold in the shops, and into solution of mild alcali;"|FALSE
15707|"and into a solution of caustic alcali; and into oil of turpentine; without"|FALSE
15707|"their being dissolved. All these mixtures were after some time put into a"|FALSE
15707|"heat of boiling water, and then the oil of turpentine dissolved its"|FALSE
15707|"fragments of bile-stone, but no alteration was produced upon those in the"|FALSE
15707|"other liquids except some change of their colour."|FALSE
15707|"Some fragments of the same bile-stone were put into vitriolic æther, and"|FALSE
15707|"were quickly dissolved without additional heat. Might not æther mixed with"|FALSE
15707|"yolk of egg or with honey be given advantageously in bilious concretions?"|FALSE
15707|"I have in two instances seen from 30 to 50 bile-stones come away by stool,"|FALSE
15707|"about the size of large peas, after having given six grains of calomel in"|FALSE
15707|"the evening, and four ounces of oil of almonds or olives on the succeeding"|FALSE
15707|"morning. I have also given half a pint of good olive or almond oil as an"|FALSE
15707|"emetic during the painful fit, and repeated it in half an hour, if the"|FALSE
15707|"first did not operate, with frequent good effect."|FALSE
15707|"4. Another disease of the liver, which I have several times observed,"|FALSE
15707|"consists in the inability or paralysis of the secretory vessels. This"|FALSE
15707|"disease has generally the same cause as the preceding one, the too frequent"|FALSE
15707|"potation of spirituous liquors, or the too sudden omission of them, after"|FALSE
15707|"the habit is confined; and is greater or less in proportion, as the whole"|FALSE
15707|"or a part of the liver is affected, and as the inability or paralysis is"|FALSE
15707|"more or less complete."|FALSE
15707|"This palsy of the liver is known from these symptoms, the patients have"|FALSE
15707|"generally passed the meridian of life, have drank fermented liquors daily,"|FALSE
15707|"but perhaps not been opprobrious drunkards; they lose their appetite, then"|FALSE
15707|"their flesh and strength diminish in consequence, there appears no bile in"|FALSE
15707|"their stools, nor in their urine, nor is any hardness or swelling"|FALSE
15707|"perceptible on the region of the liver. But what is peculiar to this"|FALSE
15707|"disease, and distinguishes it from all others at the first glance of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye, is the bombycinous colour of the skin, which, like that of full-grown"|FALSE
15707|"silkworms, has a degree of transparency with a yellow tint not greater than"|FALSE
15707|"is natural to the serum of the blood."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. C. and Mr. B. both very strong men, between 50 and 60 years of age, who"|FALSE
15707|"had drank ale at their meals instead of small beer, but were not reputed"|FALSE
15707|"hard-drinkers, suddenly became weak, lost their appetite, flesh, and"|FALSE
15707|"strength, with all the symptoms above enumerated, and died in about two"|FALSE
15707|"months from the beginning of their malady. Mr. C. became anasarcous a few"|FALSE
15707|"days before his death, and Mr. B. had frequent and great hæmorrhages from"|FALSE
15707|"an issue, and some parts of his mouth, a few days before his death. In both"|FALSE
15707|"these cases calomel, bitters and chalybeates were repeatedly used without"|FALSE
15707|"effect."|FALSE
15707|"One of the patients described above, Mr. C, was by trade a plumber; both of"|FALSE
15707|"them could digest no food, and died apparently for want of blood. Might not"|FALSE
15707|"the transfusion of blood be used in these cases with advantage?"|FALSE
15707|"5. When the paralysis of the hepatic glands is less complete, or less"|FALSE
15707|"universal, a schirrosity of some part of the liver is induced; for the"|FALSE
15707|"secretory vessels retaining some of their living power take up a fluid from"|FALSE
15707|"the circulation, without being sufficiently irritable to carry it forwards"|FALSE
15707|"to their excretory ducts; hence the body, or receptacle of each gland,"|FALSE
15707|"becomes inflated, and this distension increases, till by its very great"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus inflammation is produced, or till those parts of the viscus become"|FALSE
15707|"totally paralytic. This disease is distinguishable from the foregoing by"|FALSE
15707|"the palpable hardness or largeness of the liver; and as the hepatic glands"|FALSE
15707|"are not totally paralytic, or the whole liver not affected, some bile"|FALSE
15707|"continues to be made. The inflammations of this viscus, consequent to the"|FALSE
15707|"schirrosity of it, belong to the diseases of the sensitive motions, and"|FALSE
15707|"will be treated of hereafter."|FALSE
15707|"6. The ancients are said to have possessed an art of increasing the livers"|FALSE
15707|"of geese to a size greater than the remainder of the goose. Martial. l. 13."|FALSE
15707|"epig. 58.--This is said to have been done by fat and figs. Horace, l. 2."|FALSE
15707|"sat. 8.--Juvenal sets these large livers before an epicure as a great"|FALSE
15707|"rarity. Sat. 5. l. 114; and Persius, sat. 6. l. 71. Pliny says these large"|FALSE
15707|"goose-livers were soaked in mulled milk, that is, I suppose, milk mixed"|FALSE
15707|"with honey and wine; and adds, \"that it is uncertain whether Scipio"|FALSE
15707|"Metellus, of consular dignity, or M. Sestius, a Roman knight, was the great"|FALSE
15707|"discoverer of this excellent dish.\" A modern traveller, I believe Mr."|FALSE
15707|"Brydone, asserts that the art of enlarging the livers of geese still exists"|FALSE
15707|"in Sicily; and it is to be lamented that he did not import it into his"|FALSE
15707|"native country, as some method of affecting the human liver might perhaps"|FALSE
15707|"have been collected from it; besides the honour he might have acquired in"|FALSE
15707|"improving our giblet pies."|FALSE
15707|"Our wiser caupones, I am told, know how to fatten their fowls, as well as"|FALSE
15707|"their geese, for the London markets, by mixing gin instead of figs and fat"|FALSE
15707|"with their food; by which they are said to become sleepy, and to fatten"|FALSE
15707|"apace, and probably acquire enlarged livers; as the swine are asserted to"|FALSE
15707|"do, which are fed on the sediments of barrels in the distilleries; and"|FALSE
15707|"which so frequently obtains in those, who ingurgitate much ale, or wine, or"|FALSE
15707|"drams."|FALSE
15707|"II. The irritative diseases of the kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and other"|FALSE
15707|"glands, are analogous to those of the liver above described, differing only"|FALSE
15707|"in the consequences attending their inability to action. For instance, when"|FALSE
15707|"the secretory vessels of the kidneys become disobedient to the stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"the passing current of blood, no urine is separated or produced by them;"|FALSE
15707|"their excretory mouths become filled with concreted mucus, or calculus"|FALSE
15707|"matter, and in eight or ten days stupor and death supervenes in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"of the retention of the feculent part of the blood."|FALSE
15707|"This disease in a slighter degree, or when only a part of the kidney is"|FALSE
15707|"affected, is succeeded by partial inflammation of the kidney in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"of previous torpor. In that case greater actions of the secretory vessels"|FALSE
15707|"occur, and the nucleus of gravel is formed by the inflamed mucous membranes"|FALSE
15707|"of the tubuli uriniferi, as farther explained in its place."|FALSE
15707|"This torpor, or paralysis of the secretory vessels of the kidneys, like"|FALSE
15707|"that of the liver, owes its origin to their being previously habituated to"|FALSE
15707|"too great stimulus; which in this country is generally owing to the alcohol"|FALSE
15707|"contained in ale or wine; and hence must be registered amongst the diseases"|FALSE
15707|"owing to inebriety; though it may be caused by whatever occasionally"|FALSE
15707|"inflames the kidney; as too violent riding on horseback, or the cold from a"|FALSE
15707|"damp bed, or by sleeping on the cold ground; or perhaps by drinking in"|FALSE
15707|"general too little aqueous fluids."|FALSE
15707|"III. I shall conclude this section on the diseases of the liver induced by"|FALSE
15707|"spirituous liquors, with the well known story of Prometheus, which seems"|FALSE
15707|"indeed to have been invented by physicians in those ancient times, when all"|FALSE
15707|"things were clothed in hieroglyphic, or in fable. Prometheus was painted as"|FALSE
15707|"stealing fire from heaven, which might well represent the inflammable"|FALSE
15707|"spirit produced by fermentation; which may be said to animate or enliven"|FALSE
15707|"the man of clay: whence the conquests of Bacchus, as well as the temporary"|FALSE
15707|"mirth and noise of his devotees. But the after punishment of those, who"|FALSE
15707|"steal this accursed fire, is a vulture gnawing the liver; and well"|FALSE
15707|"allegorises the poor inebriate lingering for years under painful hepatic"|FALSE
15707|"diseases. When the expediency of laying a further tax on the distillation"|FALSE
15707|"of spirituous liquors from grain was canvassed before the House of Commons"|FALSE
15707|"some years ago, it was said of the distillers, with great truth, \"_They"|FALSE
15707|"take the bread from the people, and convert it into poison!_\" Yet is this"|FALSE
15707|"manufactory of disease permitted to continue, as appears by its paying into"|FALSE
15707|"the treasury above 900,000l. near a million of money annually. And thus,"|FALSE
15707|"under the names of rum, brandy, gin, whisky, usquebaugh, wine, cyder, beer,"|FALSE
15707|"and porter, alcohol is become the bane of the Christian world, as opium of"|FALSE

15707|"Antient writers have spoken much of temperaments, but without sufficient"|FALSE
15707|"precision. By temperament of the system should be meant a permanent"|FALSE
15707|"predisposition to certain classes of diseases: without this definition a"|FALSE
15707|"temporary predisposition to every distinct malady might be termed a"|FALSE
15707|"temperament. There are four kinds of constitution, which permanently"|FALSE
15707|"deviate from good health, and are perhaps sufficiently marked to be"|FALSE
15707|"distinguished from each other, and constitute the temperaments or"|FALSE
15707|"predispositions to the irritative, sensitive, voluntary, and associate"|FALSE
15707|"classes of diseases."|FALSE
15707|"I. _The Temperament of decreased Irritability._"|FALSE
15707|"The diseases, which are caused by irritation, most frequently originate"|FALSE
15707|"from the defect of it; for those, which are immediately owing to the excess"|FALSE
15707|"of it, as the hot fits of fever, are generally occasioned by an"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of sensorial power in consequence of a previous defect of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, as in the preceding cold fits of fever. Whereas the diseases,"|FALSE
15707|"which are caused by sensation and volition, most frequently originate from"|FALSE
15707|"the excess of those sensorial powers, as will be explained below."|FALSE
15707|"The temperament of decreased irritability appears from the following"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances, which shew that the muscular fibres or organs of sense are"|FALSE
15707|"liable to become torpid or quiescent from less defect of stimulation than"|FALSE
15707|"is productive of torpor or quiescence in other constitutions."|FALSE
15707|"1. The first is the weak pulse, which in some constitutions is at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time quick. 2. The next most marked criterion of this temperament is the"|FALSE
15707|"largeness of the aperture of the iris, or pupil of the eye, which has been"|FALSE
15707|"reckoned by some a beautiful feature in the female countenance, as an"|FALSE
15707|"indication of delicacy, but to an experienced observer it is an indication"|FALSE
15707|"of debility, and is therefore a defect, not an excellence. The third most"|FALSE
15707|"marked circumstance in this constitution is, that the extremities, as the"|FALSE
15707|"hands and feet, or nose and ears, are liable to become cold and pale in"|FALSE
15707|"situations in respect to warmth, where those of greater strength are not"|FALSE
15707|"affected. Those of this temperament are subject to hysteric affections,"|FALSE
15707|"nervous fevers, hydrocephalus, scrophula, and consumption, and to all other"|FALSE
15707|"diseases of debility."|FALSE
15707|"Those, who possess this kind of constitution, are popularly supposed to be"|FALSE
15707|"more irritable than is natural, but are in reality less so."|FALSE
15707|"This mistake has arisen from their generally having a greater quickness of"|FALSE
15707|"pulse, as explained in Sect. XII. 1. 4. XII. 3. 3.; but this frequency of"|FALSE
15707|"pulse is not necessary to the temperament, like the debility of it."|FALSE
15707|"Persons of this temperament are frequently found amongst the softer sex,"|FALSE
15707|"and amongst narrow-shouldered men; who are said to bear labour worse, and"|FALSE
15707|"pain better than others. This last circumstance is supposed to have"|FALSE
15707|"prevented the natives of North America from having been made slaves by the"|FALSE
15707|"Europeans. They are a narrow-shouldered race of people, and will rather"|FALSE
15707|"expire under the lash, than be made to labour. Some nations of Asia have"|FALSE
15707|"small hands, as may be seen by the handles of their scymetars; which with"|FALSE
15707|"their narrow shoulders shew, that they have not been accustomed to so great"|FALSE
15707|"labour with their hands and arms, as the European nations in agriculture,"|FALSE
15707|"and those on the coasts of Africa in swimming and rowing. Dr. Maningham, a"|FALSE
15707|"popular accoucheur in the beginning of this century, observes in his"|FALSE
15707|"aphorisms, that broad-shouldered men procreate broad-shouldered children."|FALSE
15707|"Now as labour strengthens the muscles employed, and increases their bulk,"|FALSE
15707|"it would seem that a few generations of labour or of indolence may in this"|FALSE
15707|"respect change the form and temperament of the body."|FALSE
15707|"On the contrary, those who are happily possessed of a great degree of"|FALSE
15707|"irritability, bear labour better than pain; and are strong, active, and"|FALSE
15707|"ingenious. But there is not properly a temperament of increased"|FALSE
15707|"irritability tending to disease, because an increased quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"irritative motions generally induces an increase of pleasure or pain, as in"|FALSE
15707|"intoxication, or inflammation; and then the new motions are the immediate"|FALSE
15707|"consequences of increased sensation, not of increased irritation; which"|FALSE
15707|"have hence been so perpetually confounded with each other."|FALSE
15707|"II. _Temperament of Sensibility._"|FALSE
15707|"There is not properly a temperament, or predisposition to disease, from"|FALSE
15707|"decreased sensibility, since irritability and not sensibility is"|FALSE
15707|"immediately necessary to bodily health. Hence it is the excess of sensation"|FALSE
15707|"alone, as it is the defect of irritation, that most frequently produces"|FALSE
15707|"disease. This temperament of increased sensibility is known from the"|FALSE
15707|"increased activity of all those motions of the organs of sense and muscles,"|FALSE
15707|"which are exerted in consequence of pleasure or pain, as in the beginning"|FALSE
15707|"of drunkenness, and in inflammatory fever. Hence those of this constitution"|FALSE
15707|"are liable to inflammatory diseases, as hepatitis; and to that kind of"|FALSE
15707|"consumption which is hereditary, and commences with slight repeated"|FALSE
15707|"hæmoptoe. They have high-coloured lips, frequently dark hair and dark eyes"|FALSE
15707|"with large pupils, and are in that case subject to gutta serena. They are"|FALSE
15707|"liable to enthusiasm, delirium, and reverie. In this last circumstance they"|FALSE
15707|"are liable to start at the clapping of a door; because the more intent any"|FALSE
15707|"one is on the passing current of his ideas, the greater surprise he"|FALSE
15707|"experiences on their being dissevered by some external violence, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XIX. on reverie."|FALSE
15707|"As in these constitutions more than the natural quantities of sensitive"|FALSE
15707|"motions are produced by the increased quantity of sensation existing in the"|FALSE
15707|"habit, it follows, that the irritative motions will be performed in some"|FALSE
15707|"degree with less energy, owing to the great expenditure of sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"on the sensitive ones. Hence those of this temperament do not attend to"|FALSE
15707|"slight stimulations, as explained in Sect. XIX. But when a stimulus is so"|FALSE
15707|"great as to excite sensation, it produces greater sensitive actions of the"|FALSE
15707|"system than in others; such as delirium or inflammation. Hence they are"|FALSE
15707|"liable to be absent in company; sit or lie long in one posture; and in"|FALSE
15707|"winter have the skin of their legs burnt into various colours by the fire."|FALSE
15707|"Hence also they are fearful of pain; covet music and sleep; and delight in"|FALSE
15707|"poetry and romance."|FALSE
15707|"As the motions in consequence of sensation are more than natural, it also"|FALSE
15707|"happens from the greater expenditure of sensorial power on them, that the"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary motions are less easily exerted. Hence the subjects of this"|FALSE
15707|"temperament are indolent in respect to all voluntary exertions, whether of"|FALSE
15707|"mind or body."|FALSE
15707|"A race of people of this description seems to have been found by the"|FALSE
15707|"Spaniards in the islands of America, where they first landed, ten of whom"|FALSE
15707|"are said not to have consumed more food than one Spaniard, nor to have been"|FALSE
15707|"capable of more than one tenth of the exertion of a Spaniard. Robertson's"|FALSE
15707|"History.--In a state similar to this the greatest part of the animal world"|FALSE
15707|"pass their lives, between sleep or inactive reverie, except when they are"|FALSE
15707|"excited by the call of hunger."|FALSE
15707|"III. _The Temperament of increased Voluntarity._"|FALSE
15707|"Those of this constitution differ from both the last mentioned in this,"|FALSE
15707|"that the pain, which gradually subsides in the first, and is productive of"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation or delirium in the second, is in this succeeded by the"|FALSE
15707|"exertion of the muscles or ideas, which are most frequently connected with"|FALSE
15707|"volition; and they are thence subject to locked jaw, convulsions, epilepsy,"|FALSE
15707|"and mania, as explained in Sect. XXXIV. Those of this temperament attend to"|FALSE
15707|"the slightest irritations or sensations, and immediately exert themselves"|FALSE
15707|"to obtain or avoid the objects of them; they can at the same time bear cold"|FALSE
15707|"and hunger better than others, of which Charles the Twelfth of Sweden was"|FALSE
15707|"an instance. They are suited and generally prompted to all great exertions"|FALSE
15707|"of genius or labour, as their desires are more extensive and more vehement,"|FALSE
15707|"and their powers of attention and of labour greater. It is this facility of"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary exertion, which distinguishes men from brutes, and which has made"|FALSE
15707|"them lords of the creation."|FALSE
15707|"IV. _The Temperament of increased Association._"|FALSE
15707|"This constitution consists in the too great facility, with which the"|FALSE
15707|"fibrous motions acquire habits of association, and by which these"|FALSE
15707|"associations become proportionably stronger than in those of the other"|FALSE
15707|"temperaments. Those of this temperament are slow in voluntary exertions, or"|FALSE
15707|"in those dependent on sensation, or on irritation. Hence great memories"|FALSE
15707|"have been said to be attended with less sense and less imagination from"|FALSE
15707|"Aristotle down to the present time; for by the word memory these writers"|FALSE
15707|"only understood the unmeaning repetition of words or numbers in the order"|FALSE
15707|"they were received, without any voluntary efforts of the mind."|FALSE
15707|"In this temperament those associations of motions, which are commonly"|FALSE
15707|"termed sympathies, act with greater certainty and energy, as those between"|FALSE
15707|"disturbed vision and the inversion of the motion of the stomach, as in"|FALSE
15707|"sea-sickness; and the pains in the shoulder from hepatic inflammation. Add"|FALSE
15707|"to this, that the catenated circles of actions are of greater extent than"|FALSE
15707|"in the other constitutions. Thus if a strong vomit or cathartic be"|FALSE
15707|"exhibited in this temperament, a smaller quantity will produce as great an"|FALSE
15707|"effect, if it be given some weeks afterwards; whereas in other temperaments"|FALSE
15707|"this is only to be expected, if it be exhibited in a few days after the"|FALSE
15707|"first dose. Hence quartan agues are formed in those of this temperament, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Section XXXII. on diseases from irritation, and other"|FALSE
15707|"intermittents are liable to recur from slight causes many weeks after they"|FALSE
15707|"have been cured by the bark."|FALSE
15707|"V. The first of these temperaments differs from the standard of health from"|FALSE
15707|"defect, and the others from excess of sensorial power; but it sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"happens that the same individual, from the changes introduced into his"|FALSE
15707|"habit by the different seasons of the year, modes or periods of life, or by"|FALSE
15707|"accidental diseases, passes from one of these temperaments to another. Thus"|FALSE
15707|"a long use of too much fermented liquor produces the temperament of"|FALSE
15707|"increased sensibility; great indolence and solitude that of decreased"|FALSE
15707|"irritability; and want of the necessaries of life that of increased"|FALSE
15707|"voluntarity."|FALSE

15707|"each pulsation, whether these motions are occasioned by defect of their"|FALSE
15707|"natural stimuli, or by the defect of other irritative motions with which"|FALSE
15707|"they are associated, or from the inirritability of the arterial system,"|FALSE
15707|"that is, from a decreased quantity of sensorial power, another kind of"|FALSE
15707|"fever arises; which may be termed, Typhus irritativus, or Febris irritativa"|FALSE
15707|"pulsu debili, or irritative fever with weak pulse. The former of these"|FALSE
15707|"fevers is the synocha of nosologists, and the latter the typhus mitior, or"|FALSE
15707|"nervous fever. In the former there appears to be an increase of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, in the latter a deficiency of it; which is shewn to be the immediate"|FALSE
15707|"cause of strength and weakness, as defined in Sect. XII. 1. 3."|FALSE
15707|"It should be added, that a temporary quantity of strength or debility may"|FALSE
15707|"be induced by the defect or excess of stimulus above what is natural; and"|FALSE
15707|"that in the same fever _debility always exists during the cold fit, though"|FALSE
15707|"strength does not always exist during the hot fit._"|FALSE
15707|"These fevers are always connected with, and generally induced by, the"|FALSE
15707|"disordered irritative motions of the organs of sense, or of the intestinal"|FALSE
15707|"canal, or of the glandular system, or of the absorbent system; and hence"|FALSE
15707|"are always complicated with some or many of these disordered motions, which"|FALSE
15707|"are termed the symptoms of the fever, and which compose the great variety"|FALSE
15707|"in these diseases."|FALSE
15707|"The irritative fevers both with strong and with weak pulse, as well as the"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive fevers with strong and with weak pulse, which are to be described"|FALSE
15707|"in the next section, are liable to periodical remissions, and then they"|FALSE
15707|"take the name of intermittent fevers, and are distinguished by the"|FALSE
15707|"periodical times of their access."|FALSE
15707|"II. For the better illustration of the phenomena of irritative fevers we"|FALSE
15707|"must refer the reader to the circumstances of irritation explained in Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XII. and shall commence this intricate subject by speaking of the quick"|FALSE
15707|"pulse, and proceed by considering many of the causes, which either"|FALSE
15707|"separately or in combination most frequently produce the cold fits of"|FALSE
15707|"fevers."|FALSE
15707|"1. If the arteries are dilated but to half their usual diameters, though"|FALSE
15707|"they contract twice as frequently in a given time, they will circulate only"|FALSE
15707|"half their usual quantity of blood: for as they are cylinders, the blood"|FALSE
15707|"which they contain must be as the squares of their diameters. Hence when"|FALSE
15707|"the pulse becomes quicker and smaller in the same proportion, the heart and"|FALSE
15707|"arteries act with less energy than in their natural state. See Sect. XII."|FALSE
15707|"1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"That this quick small pulse is owing to want of irritability, appears,"|FALSE
15707|"first, because it attends other symptoms of want of irritability; and,"|FALSE
15707|"secondly, because on the application of a stimulus greater than usual, it"|FALSE
15707|"becomes slower and larger. Thus in cold fits of agues, in hysteric"|FALSE
15707|"palpitations of the heart, and when the body is much exhausted by"|FALSE
15707|"hæmorrhages, or by fatigue, as well as in nervous fevers, the pulse becomes"|FALSE
15707|"quick and small; and secondly, in all those cases if an increase of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus be added, by giving a little wine or opium; the quick small pulse"|FALSE
15707|"becomes slower and larger, as any one may easily experience on himself, by"|FALSE
15707|"counting his pulse after drinking one or two glasses of wine, when he is"|FALSE
15707|"faint from hunger or fatigue."|FALSE
15707|"Now nothing can so strongly evince that this quick small pulse is owing to"|FALSE
15707|"defect of irritability, than that an additional stimulus, above what is"|FALSE
15707|"natural, makes it become slower and larger immediately: for what is meant"|FALSE
15707|"by a defect of irritability, but that the arteries and heart are not"|FALSE
15707|"excited into their usual exertions by their usual quantity of stimulus? but"|FALSE
15707|"if you increase the quantity of stimulus, and they immediately act with"|FALSE
15707|"their usual energy, this proves their previous want of their natural degree"|FALSE
15707|"of irritability. Thus the trembling hands of drunkards in a morning become"|FALSE
15707|"steady, and acquire strength to perform their usual offices, by the"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed stimulus of a glass or two of brandy."|FALSE
15707|"2. In sleep and in apoplexy the pulse becomes slower, which is not owing to"|FALSE
15707|"defect of irritability, for it is at the same time larger; and thence the"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of the circulation is rather increased than diminished. In these"|FALSE
15707|"cases the organs of sense are closed, and the voluntary power is suspended,"|FALSE
15707|"while the motions dependent on internal irritations, as those of digestion"|FALSE
15707|"and secretion, are carried on with more than their usual vigour; which has"|FALSE
15707|"led superficial observers to confound these cases with those arising from"|FALSE
15707|"want of irritability. Thus if you lift up the eyelid of an apoplectic"|FALSE
15707|"patient, who is not actually dying, the iris will, as usual, contract"|FALSE
15707|"itself, as this motion is associated with the stimulus of light; but it is"|FALSE
15707|"not so in the last stages of nervous fevers, where the pupil of the eye"|FALSE
15707|"continues expanded in the broad day-light: in the former case there is a"|FALSE
15707|"want of voluntary power, in the latter a want of irritability."|FALSE
15707|"Hence also those constitutions which are deficient in quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"irritability, and which possess too great sensibility, as during the pain"|FALSE
15707|"of hunger, of hysteric spasms, or nervous headachs, are generally supposed"|FALSE
15707|"to have too much irritability; and opium, which in its due dose is a most"|FALSE
15707|"powerful stimulant, is erroneously called a sedative; because by increasing"|FALSE
15707|"the irritative motions it decreases the pains arising from defect of them."|FALSE
15707|"Why the pulse should become quicker both from an increase of irritation, as"|FALSE
15707|"in the synocha irritativa, or irritative fever with strong pulse; and from"|FALSE
15707|"the decrease of it, as in the typhus irritativus, or irritative fever with"|FALSE
15707|"weak pulse; seems paradoxical. The former circumstance needs no"|FALSE
15707|"illustration; since if the stimulus of the blood, or the irritability of"|FALSE
15707|"the sanguiferous system be increased, and the strength of the patient not"|FALSE
15707|"diminished, it is plain that the motions must be performed quicker and"|FALSE
15707|"stronger."|FALSE
15707|"In the latter circumstance the weakness of the muscular power of the heart"|FALSE
15707|"is soon over-balanced by the elasticity of the coats of the arteries, which"|FALSE
15707|"they possess besides a muscular power of contraction; and hence the"|FALSE
15707|"arteries are distended to less than their usual diameters. The heart being"|FALSE
15707|"thus stopped, when it is but half emptied, begins sooner to dilate again;"|FALSE
15707|"and the arteries being dilated to less than their usual diameters, begin so"|FALSE
15707|"much sooner to contract themselves; insomuch, that in the last stages of"|FALSE
15707|"fevers with weakness the frequency of pulsation of the heart and arteries"|FALSE
15707|"becomes doubled; which, however, is never the case in fevers with strength,"|FALSE
15707|"in which they seldom exceed 118 or 120 pulsations in a minute. It must be"|FALSE
15707|"added, that in these cases, while the pulse is very small and very quick,"|FALSE
15707|"the heart often feels large, and labouring to one's hand; which coincides"|FALSE
15707|"with the above explanation, shewing that it does not completely empty"|FALSE
15707|"itself."|FALSE
15707|"3. In cases however of debility from paucity of blood, as in animals which"|FALSE
15707|"are bleeding to death in the slaughter-house, the quick pulsations of the"|FALSE
15707|"heart and arteries may be owing to their not being distended to more than"|FALSE
15707|"half their usual diastole; and in consequence they must contract sooner, or"|FALSE
15707|"more frequently, in a given time. As weak people are liable to a deficient"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of blood, this cause may occasionally contribute to quicken the"|FALSE
15707|"pulse in fevers with debility, which may be known by applying one's hand"|FALSE
15707|"upon the heart as above; but the principal cause I suppose to consist in"|FALSE
15707|"the diminution of sensorial power. When a muscle contains, or is supplied"|FALSE
15707|"with but little sensorial power, its contraction soon ceases, and in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence may soon recur, as is seen in the trembling hands of people"|FALSE
15707|"weakened by age or by drunkenness. See Sect. XII. 1. 4. XII. 3. 4."|FALSE
15707|"It may nevertheless frequently happen, that both the deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, as where the quantity of blood is lessened (as described in No."|FALSE
15707|"4. of this section), and the deficiency of sensorial power, as in those of"|FALSE
15707|"the temperament of irritability, described in Sect. XXXI. occur at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time; which will thus add to the quickness of the pulse and to the danger"|FALSE
15707|"of the disease."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. A certain degree of heat is necessary to muscular motion, and is,"|FALSE
15707|"in consequence, essential to life. This is observed in those animals and"|FALSE
15707|"insects which pass the cold season in a torpid state, and which revive on"|FALSE
15707|"being warmed by the fire. This necessary stimulus of heat has two sources;"|FALSE
15707|"one from the fluid atmosphere of heat, in which all things are immersed,"|FALSE
15707|"and the other from the internal combinations of the particles, which form"|FALSE
15707|"the various fluids, which are produced in the extensive systems of the"|FALSE
15707|"glands. When either the external heat, which surrounds us, or the internal"|FALSE
15707|"production of it, becomes lessened to a certain degree, the pain of cold is"|FALSE
15707|"perceived."|FALSE
15707|"This pain of cold is experienced most sensibly by our teeth, when ice is"|FALSE
15707|"held in the mouth; or by our whole system after having been previously"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed to much warmth. It is probable, that this pain does not arise"|FALSE
15707|"from the mechanical or chemical effects of a deficiency of heat; but that,"|FALSE
15707|"like the organs of sense by which we perceive hunger and thirst, this sense"|FALSE
15707|"of heat suffers pain, when the stimulus of its object is wanting to excite"|FALSE
15707|"the irritative motions of the organ; that is, when the sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"becomes too much accumulated in the quiescent fibres. See Sect. XII. 5. 3."|FALSE
15707|"For as the peristaltic motions of the stomach are lessened, when the pain"|FALSE
15707|"of hunger is great, so the action of the cutaneous capillaries are lessened"|FALSE
15707|"during the pain of cold; as appears by the paleness of the skin, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XIV. 6. on the production of ideas."|FALSE
15707|"The pain in the small of the back and forehead in the cold fits of the"|FALSE
15707|"ague, in nervous hemicrania, and in hysteric paroxysms, when all the"|FALSE
15707|"irritative motions are much impaired, seems to arise from this cause; the"|FALSE
15707|"vessels of these membranes or muscles become torpid by their irritative"|FALSE
15707|"associations with other parts of the body, and thence produce less of their"|FALSE
15707|"accustomed secretions, and in consequence less heat is evolved, and they"|FALSE
15707|"experience the pain of cold; which coldness may often be felt by the hand"|FALSE
15707|"applied upon the affected part."|FALSE
15707|"2. The importance of a greater or less deduction of heat from the system"|FALSE
15707|"will be more easy to comprehend, if we first consider the great expense of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power used in carrying on the vital motions; that is, which"|FALSE
15707|"circulates, absorbs, secretes, aerates, and elaborates the whole mass of"|FALSE
15707|"fluids with unceasing assiduity. The sensorial power, or spirit of"|FALSE
15707|"animation, used in giving perpetual and strong motion to the heart, which"|FALSE
15707|"overcomes the elasticity and vis inertiæ of the whole arterial system; next"|FALSE
15707|"the expense of sensorial power in moving with great force and velocity the"|FALSE
15707|"innumerable trunks and ramifications of the arterial system; the expense of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power in circulating the whole mass of blood through the long and"|FALSE
15707|"intricate intortions of the very fine vessels, which compose the glands and"|FALSE
15707|"capillaries; then the expense of sensorial power in the exertions of the"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent extremities of all the lacteals, and of all the lymphatics, which"|FALSE
15707|"open their mouths on the external surface of the skin, and on the internal"|FALSE
15707|"surfaces of every cell or interstice of the body; then the expense of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power in the venous absorption, by which the blood is received"|FALSE
15707|"from the capillary vessels, or glands, where the arterial power ceases, and"|FALSE
15707|"is drank up, and returned to the heart; next the expense of sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"used by the muscles of respiration in their office of perpetually expanding"|FALSE
15707|"the bronchia, or air-vessels, of the lungs; and lastly in the unceasing"|FALSE
15707|"peristaltic motions of the stomach and whole system of intestines, and in"|FALSE
15707|"all the secretions of bile, gastric juice, mucus, perspirable matter, and"|FALSE
15707|"the various excretions from the system. If we consider the ceaseless"|FALSE
15707|"expense of sensorial power thus perpetually employed, it will appear to be"|FALSE
15707|"much greater in a day than all the voluntary exertions of our muscles and"|FALSE
15707|"organs of sense consume in a week; and all this without any sensible"|FALSE
15707|"fatigue! Now, if but a part of these vital motions are impeded, or totally"|FALSE
15707|"stopped for but a short time, we gain an idea, that there must be a great"|FALSE
15707|"accumulation of sensorial power; as its production in these organs, which"|FALSE
15707|"are subject to perpetual activity, is continued during their quiescence,"|FALSE
15707|"and is in consequence accumulated."|FALSE
15707|"While, on the contrary, where those vital organs act too forcibly by"|FALSE
15707|"increase of stimulus without a proportionally-increased production of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power in the brain, it is evident, that a great deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"action, that is torpor, must soon follow, as in fevers; whereas the"|FALSE
15707|"locomotive muscles, which act only by intervals, are neither liable to so"|FALSE
15707|"great accumulation of sensorial power during their times of inactivity, nor"|FALSE
15707|"to so great an exhaustion of it during their times of action."|FALSE
15707|"Thus, on going into a very cold bath, suppose at 33 degrees of heat on"|FALSE
15707|"Fahrenheit's scale, the action of the subcutaneous capillaries, or glands,"|FALSE
15707|"and of the mouths of the cutaneous absorbents is diminished, or ceases for"|FALSE
15707|"a time. Hence less or no blood passes these capillaries, and paleness"|FALSE
15707|"succeeds. But soon after emerging from the bath, a more florid colour and a"|FALSE
15707|"greater degree of heat is generated on the skin than was possessed before"|FALSE
15707|"immersion; for the capillary glands, after this quiescent state, occasioned"|FALSE
15707|"by the want of stimulus, become more irritable than usual to their natural"|FALSE
15707|"stimuli, owing to the accumulation of sensorial power, and hence a greater"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of blood is transmitted through them, and a greater secretion of"|FALSE
15707|"perspirable matter; and, in consequence, a greater degree of heat succeeds."|FALSE
15707|"During the continuance in cold water the breath is cold, and the act of"|FALSE
15707|"respiration quick and laborious; which have generally been ascribed to the"|FALSE
15707|"obstruction of the circulating fluid by a spasm of the cutaneous vessels,"|FALSE
15707|"and by a consequent accumulation of blood in the lungs, occasioned by the"|FALSE
15707|"pressure as well as by the coldness of the water. This is not a"|FALSE
15707|"satisfactory account of this curious phænomenon, since at this time the"|FALSE
15707|"whole circulation is less, as appears from the smallness of the pulse and"|FALSE
15707|"coldness of the breath; which shew that less blood passes through the lungs"|FALSE
15707|"in a given time; the same laborious breathing immediately occurs when the"|FALSE
15707|"paleness of the skin is produced by fear, where no external cold or"|FALSE
15707|"pressure are applied."|FALSE
15707|"The minute vessels of the bronchia, through which the blood passes from the"|FALSE
15707|"arterial to the venal system, and which correspond with the cutaneous"|FALSE
15707|"capillaries, have frequently been exposed to cold air, and become quiescent"|FALSE
15707|"along with those of the skin; and hence their motions are so associated"|FALSE
15707|"together, that when one is affected either with quiescence or exertion, the"|FALSE
15707|"other sympathizes with it, according to the laws of irritative association."|FALSE
15707|"See Sect. XXVII. 1. on hæmorrhages."|FALSE
15707|"Besides the quiescence of the minute vessels of the lungs, there are many"|FALSE
15707|"other systems of vessels which become torpid from their irritative"|FALSE
15707|"associations with those of the skin, as the absorbents of the bladder and"|FALSE
15707|"intestines; whence an evacuation of pale urine occurs, when the naked skin"|FALSE
15707|"is exposed only to the coldness of the atmosphere; and sprinkling the naked"|FALSE
15707|"body with cold water is known to remove even pertinacious constipation of"|FALSE
15707|"the bowels. From the quiescence of such extensive systems of vessels as the"|FALSE
15707|"glands and capillaries of the skin, and the minute vessels of the lungs,"|FALSE
15707|"with their various absorbent series of vessels, a great accumulation of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial powers is occasioned; part of which is again expended in the"|FALSE
15707|"increased exertion of all these vessels, with an universal glow of heat in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of this exertion, and the remainder of it adds vigour to both"|FALSE
15707|"the vital and voluntary exertions of the whole day."|FALSE
15707|"If the activity of the subcutaneous vessels, and of those with which their"|FALSE
15707|"actions are associated, was too great before cold immersion, as in the hot"|FALSE
15707|"days of summer, and by that means the sensorial power was previously"|FALSE
15707|"diminished, we see the cause why the cold bath gives such present strength;"|FALSE
15707|"namely, by stopping the unnecessary activity of the subcutaneous vessels,"|FALSE
15707|"and thus preventing the too great exhaustion of sensorial power; which, in"|FALSE
15707|"metaphorical language, has been called _bracing_ the system: which is,"|FALSE
15707|"however, a mechanical term, only applicable to drums, or musical strings:"|FALSE
15707|"as on the contrary the word _relaxation_, when applied to living animal"|FALSE
15707|"bodies, can only mean too small a quantity of stimulus, or too small a"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of sensorial power; as explained in Sect. XII. 1."|FALSE
15707|"3. This experiment of cold bathing presents us with a simple fever-fit; for"|FALSE
15707|"the pulse is weak, small, and quick during the cold immersion; and becomes"|FALSE
15707|"strong, full, and quick during the subsequent glow of heat; till in a few"|FALSE
15707|"minutes these symptoms subside, and the temporary fever ceases."|FALSE
15707|"In those constitutions where the degree of inirritability, or of debility,"|FALSE
15707|"is greater than natural, the coldness and paleness of the skin with the"|FALSE
15707|"quick and weak pulse continue a long time after the patient leaves the"|FALSE
15707|"bath; and the subsequent heat approaches by unequal flushings, and he feels"|FALSE
15707|"himself disordered for many hours. Hence the bathing in a cold spring of"|FALSE
15707|"water, where the heat is but forty-eight degrees on Fahrenheit's"|FALSE
15707|"thermometer, much disagrees with those of weak or inirritable habits of"|FALSE
15707|"body; who possess so little sensorial power, that they cannot without"|FALSE
15707|"injury bear to have it diminished even for a short time; but who can"|FALSE
15707|"nevertheless bear the more temperate coldness of Buxton bath, which is"|FALSE
15707|"about eighty degrees of heat, and which strengthens them, and makes them by"|FALSE
15707|"habit less liable to great quiescence from small variations of cold, and"|FALSE
15707|"thence less liable to be disordered by the unavoidable accidents of life."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, why people of these inirritable constitutions, which is"|FALSE
15707|"another expression for sensorial deficiency, are often much injured by"|FALSE
15707|"bathing in a cold spring of water; and why they should continue but a very"|FALSE
15707|"short time in baths, which are colder than their bodies; and should"|FALSE
15707|"gradually increase both the degree of coldness of the water, and the time"|FALSE
15707|"of their continuance in it, if they would obtain salutary effects from cold"|FALSE
15707|"immersions. See Sect. XII. 2. 1."|FALSE
15707|"On the other hand, in all cases where the heat of the external surface of"|FALSE
15707|"the body, or of the internal surface of the lungs, is greater than natural,"|FALSE
15707|"the use of exposure to cool air may be deduced. In fever-fits attended with"|FALSE
15707|"strength, that is with great quantity of sensorial power, it removes the"|FALSE
15707|"additional stimulus of heat from the surfaces above mentioned, and thus"|FALSE
15707|"prevents their excess of useless motion; and in fever-fits attended with"|FALSE
15707|"debility, that is with a deficiency of the quantity of sensorial power, it"|FALSE
15707|"prevents the great and dangerous waste of sensorial power expended in the"|FALSE
15707|"unnecessary increase of the actions of the glands and capillaries of the"|FALSE
15707|"skin and lungs."|FALSE
15707|"4. In the same manner, when any one is long exposed to very cold air, a"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence is produced of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries and"|FALSE
15707|"absorbents, owing to the deficiency of their usual stimulus of heat; and"|FALSE
15707|"this quiescence of so great a quantity of vessels affects, by irritative"|FALSE
15707|"association, the whole absorbent and glandular system, which becomes in a"|FALSE
15707|"greater or less degree quiescent, and a cold fit of fever is produced."|FALSE
15707|"If the deficiency of the stimulus of heat is very great, the quiescence"|FALSE
15707|"becomes so general as to extinguish life, as in those who are frozen to"|FALSE
15707|"death."|FALSE
15707|"If the deficiency of heat be in less degree, but yet so great as in some"|FALSE
15707|"measure to disorder the system, and should occur the succeeding day, it"|FALSE
15707|"will induce a greater degree of quiescence than before, from its acting in"|FALSE
15707|"concurrence with the period of the diurnal circle of actions, explained in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XXXVI. Hence from a small beginning a greater and greater degree of"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence may be induced, till a complete fever-fit is formed; and which"|FALSE
15707|"will continue to recur at the periods by which it was produced. See Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XVII. 3. 6."|FALSE
15707|"If the degree of quiescence occasioned by defect of the stimulus of heat be"|FALSE
15707|"very great, it will recur a second time by a slighter cause, than that"|FALSE
15707|"which first induced it. If the cause, which induces the second fit of"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence, recurs the succeeding day, the quotidian fever is produced; if"|FALSE
15707|"not till the alternate day, the tertian fever; and if not till after"|FALSE
15707|"seventy-two hours from the first fit of quiescence, the quartan fever is"|FALSE
15707|"formed. This last kind of fever recurs less frequently than the other, as"|FALSE
15707|"it is a disease only of those of the temperament of associability, as"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned in Sect. XXXI.; for in other constitutions the capability of"|FALSE
15707|"forming a habit ceases, before the new cause of quiescence is again"|FALSE
15707|"applied, if that does not occur sooner than in seventy-two hours."|FALSE
15707|"And hence those fevers, whose cause is from cold air of the night or"|FALSE
15707|"morning, are more liable to observe the solar day in their periods; while"|FALSE
15707|"those from other causes frequently observe the lunar day in their periods,"|FALSE
15707|"their paroxysms returning near an hour later every day, as explained in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XXXVI."|FALSE
15707|"IV. Another frequent cause of the cold fits of fever is the defect of the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of distention. The whole arterial system would appear, by the"|FALSE
15707|"experiments of Haller, to be irritable by no other stimulus, and the"|FALSE
15707|"motions of the heart and alimentary canal are certainly in some measure"|FALSE
15707|"dependant on the same cause. See Sect. XIV. 7. Hence there can be no"|FALSE
15707|"wonder, that the diminution of distention should frequently induce the"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence, which constitutes the beginning of fever-fits."|FALSE
15707|"Monsieur Leiutaud has judiciously mentioned the deficiency of the quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of blood amongst the causes of diseases, which he says is frequently"|FALSE
15707|"evident in dissections: fevers are hence brought on by great hæmorrhages,"|FALSE
15707|"diarrhoeas, or other evacuations; or from the continued use of diet, which"|FALSE
15707|"contains but little nourishment; or from the exhaustion occasioned by"|FALSE
15707|"violent fatigue, or by those chronic diseases in which the digestion is"|FALSE
15707|"much impaired; as where the stomach has been long affected with the gout or"|FALSE
15707|"schirrus; or in the paralysis of the liver, as described in Sect. XXX."|FALSE
15707|"Hence a paroxysm of gout is liable to recur on bleeding or purging; as the"|FALSE
15707|"torpor of some viscus, which precedes the inflammation of the foot, is thus"|FALSE
15707|"induced by the want of the stimulus of distention. And hence the"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of the body, as the nose and fingers, are more liable to become"|FALSE
15707|"cold, when we have long abstained from food; and hence the pulse is"|FALSE
15707|"increased both in strength and velocity above the natural standard after a"|FALSE
15707|"full meal by the stimulus of distention."|FALSE
15707|"However, this stimulus of distention, like the stimulus of heat above"|FALSE
15707|"described, though it contributes much to the due action not only of the"|FALSE
15707|"heart, arteries, and alimentary canal, but seems necessary to the proper"|FALSE
15707|"secretion of all the various glands; yet perhaps it is not the sole cause"|FALSE
15707|"of any of these numerous motions: for as the lacteals, cutaneous"|FALSE
15707|"absorbents, and the various glands appear to be stimulated into action by"|FALSE
15707|"the peculiar pungency of the fluids they absorb, so in the intestinal canal"|FALSE
15707|"the pungency of the digesting aliment, or the acrimony of the fæces, seem"|FALSE
15707|"to contribute, as well as their bulk, to promote the peristaltic motions;"|FALSE
15707|"and in the arterial system, the momentum of the particles of the"|FALSE
15707|"circulating blood, and their acrimony, stimulate the arteries, as well as"|FALSE
15707|"the distention occasioned by it. Where the pulse is small this defect of"|FALSE
15707|"distention is present, and contributes much to produce the febris"|FALSE
15707|"irritativa pulsu debili, or irritative fever with weak pulse, called by"|FALSE
15707|"modern writers nervous fever, as a predisponent cause. See Sect. XII. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"Might not the transfusion of blood, suppose of four ounces daily from a"|FALSE
15707|"strong man, or other healthful animal, as a sheep or an ass, be used in the"|FALSE
15707|"early state of nervous or putrid fevers with great prospect of success?"|FALSE
15707|"V. 1. The defect of the momentum of the particles of the circulating blood"|FALSE
15707|"is another cause of the quiescence, with which the cold fits of fever"|FALSE
15707|"commence. This stimulus of the momentum of the progressive particles of the"|FALSE
15707|"blood does not act over the whole body like those of heat and distention"|FALSE
15707|"above described, but is confined to the arterial system; and differs from"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus of the distention of the blood, as much as the vibration of"|FALSE
15707|"the air does from the currents of it. Thus are the different organs of our"|FALSE
15707|"bodies stimulated by four different mechanic properties of the external"|FALSE
15707|"world: the sense of touch by the pressure of solid bodies so as to"|FALSE
15707|"distinguish their figure; the muscular system by the distention, which they"|FALSE
15707|"occasion; the internal surface of the arteries, by the momentum of their"|FALSE
15707|"moving particles; and the auditory nerves, by the vibration of them: and"|FALSE
15707|"these four mechanic properties are as different from each other as the"|FALSE
15707|"various chemical ones, which are adapted to the numerous glands, and to the"|FALSE
15707|"other organs of sense."|FALSE
15707|"2. The momentum of the progressive particles of blood is compounded of"|FALSE
15707|"their velocity and their quantity of matter: hence whatever circumstances"|FALSE
15707|"diminish either of these without proportionally increasing the other, and"|FALSE
15707|"without superadding either of the general stimuli of heat or distention,"|FALSE
15707|"will tend to produce a quiescence of the arterial system, and from thence"|FALSE
15707|"of all the other irritative motions, which are connected with it."|FALSE
15707|"Hence in all those constitutions or diseases where the blood contains a"|FALSE
15707|"greater proportion of serum, which is the lightest part of its composition,"|FALSE
15707|"the pulsations of the arteries are weaker, as in nervous fevers, chlorosis,"|FALSE
15707|"and hysteric complaints; for in these cases the momentum of the progressive"|FALSE
15707|"particles of blood is less: and hence, where the denser parts of its"|FALSE
15707|"composition abound, as the red part of it, or the coagulable lymph, the"|FALSE
15707|"arterial pulsations are stronger; as in those of robust health, and in"|FALSE
15707|"inflammatory diseases."|FALSE
15707|"That this stimulus of the momentum of the particles of the circulating"|FALSE
15707|"fluid is of the greatest consequence to the arterial action, appears from"|FALSE
15707|"the experiment of injecting air into the blood vessels, which seems to"|FALSE
15707|"destroy animal life from the want of this stimulus of momentum; for the"|FALSE
15707|"distention of the arteries is not diminished by it, it possesses no"|FALSE
15707|"corrosive acrimony, and is less liable to repass the valves than the blood"|FALSE
15707|"itself; since air-valves in all machinery require much less accuracy of"|FALSE
15707|"construction than those which are opposed to water."|FALSE
15707|"3. One method of increasing the velocity of the blood, and in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"the momentum of its particles, is by the exercise of the body, or by the"|FALSE
15707|"friction of its surface: so, on the contrary, too great indolence"|FALSE
15707|"contributes to decrease this stimulus of the momentum of the particles of"|FALSE
15707|"the circulating blood, and thus tends to induce quiescence; as is seen in"|FALSE
15707|"hysteric cases, and chlorosis, and the other diseases of sedentary people."|FALSE
15707|"4. The velocity of the particles of the blood in certain circumstances is"|FALSE
15707|"increased by venesection, which, by removing a part of it, diminishes the"|FALSE
15707|"resistance to the motion of the other part, and hence the momentum of the"|FALSE
15707|"particles of it is increased. This may be easily understood by considering"|FALSE
15707|"it in the extreme, since, if the resistance was greatly increased, so as to"|FALSE
15707|"overcome the propelling power, there could be no velocity, and in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence no momentum at all. From this circumstance arises that curious"|FALSE
15707|"phænomenon, the truth of which I have been more than once witness to, that"|FALSE
15707|"venesection will often instantaneously relieve those nervous pains, which"|FALSE
15707|"attend the cold periods of hysteric, asthmatic, or epileptic diseases; and"|FALSE
15707|"that even where large doses of opium have been in vain exhibited. In these"|FALSE
15707|"cases the pulse becomes stronger after the bleeding, and the extremities"|FALSE
15707|"regain their natural warmth; and an opiate then given acts with much more"|FALSE
15707|"certain effect."|FALSE
15707|"VI. There is another cause, which seems occasionally to induce quiescence"|FALSE
15707|"into some part of our system, I mean the influence of the sun and moon; the"|FALSE
15707|"attraction of these luminaries, by decreasing the gravity of the particles"|FALSE
15707|"of the blood, cannot affect their momentum, as their vis inertiæ remains"|FALSE
15707|"the same; but it may nevertheless produce some chemical change in them,"|FALSE
15707|"because whatever affects the general attractions of the particles of matter"|FALSE
15707|"may be supposed from analogy to affect their specific attractions or"|FALSE
15707|"affinities: and thus the stimulus of the particles of blood may be"|FALSE
15707|"diminished, though not their momentum. As the tides of the sea obey the"|FALSE
15707|"southing and northing of the moon (allowing for the time necessary for"|FALSE
15707|"their motion, and the obstructions of the shores), it is probable, that"|FALSE
15707|"there are also atmospheric tides on both sides of the earth, which to the"|FALSE
15707|"inhabitants of another planet might so deflect the light as to resemble the"|FALSE
15707|"ring of Saturn. Now as these tides of water, or of air, are raised by the"|FALSE
15707|"diminution of their gravity, it follows, that their pressure on the surface"|FALSE
15707|"of the earth is no greater than the pressure of the other parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"ocean, or of the atmosphere, where no such tides exist; and therefore that"|FALSE
15707|"they cannot affect the mercury in the barometer. In the same manner, the"|FALSE
15707|"gravity of all other terrestrial bodies is diminished at the times of the"|FALSE
15707|"southing and northing of the moon, and that in a greater degree when this"|FALSE
15707|"coincides with the southing and northing of the sun, and this in a still"|FALSE
15707|"greater degree about the times of the equinoxes. This decrease of the"|FALSE
15707|"gravity of all bodies during the time the moon passes our zenith or nadir"|FALSE
15707|"might possibly be shewn by the slower vibrations of a pendulum, compared"|FALSE
15707|"with a spring clock, or with astronomical observation. Since a pendulum of"|FALSE
15707|"a certain length moves slower at the line than near the poles, because the"|FALSE
15707|"gravity being diminished and the vis inertiæ continuing the same, the"|FALSE
15707|"motive power is less, but the resistance to be overcome continues the same."|FALSE
15707|"The combined powers of the lunar and solar attraction is estimated by Sir"|FALSE
15707|"Isaac Newton not to exceed one 7,868,850th part of the power of"|FALSE
15707|"gravitation, which seems indeed but a small circumstance to produce any"|FALSE
15707|"considerable effect on the weight of sublunary bodies, and yet this is"|FALSE
15707|"sufficient to raise the tides at the equator above ten feet high; and if it"|FALSE
15707|"be considered, what small impulses of other bodies produce their effects on"|FALSE
15707|"the organs of sense adapted to the perception of them, as of vibration on"|FALSE
15707|"the auditory nerves, we shall cease to to be surprised, that so minute a"|FALSE
15707|"diminution in the gravity of the particles of blood should so far affect"|FALSE
15707|"their chemical changes, or their stimulating quality, as, joined with other"|FALSE
15707|"causes, sometimes to produce the beginnings of diseases."|FALSE
15707|"Add to this, that if the lunar influence produces a very small degree of"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence at first, and if that recurs at certain periods even with less"|FALSE
15707|"power to produce quiescence than at first, yet the quiescence will daily"|FALSE
15707|"increase by the acquired habit acting at the same time, till at length so"|FALSE
15707|"great a degree of quiescence is induced as to produce phrensy, canine"|FALSE
15707|"madness, epilepsy, hysteric pains or cold fits of fever, instances of many"|FALSE
15707|"of which are to be found in Dr. Mead's work on this subject. The solar"|FALSE
15707|"influence also appears daily in several diseases; but as darkness, silence,"|FALSE
15707|"sleep, and our periodical meals mark the parts of the solar circle of"|FALSE
15707|"actions, it is sometimes dubious to which of these the periodical returns"|FALSE
15707|"of these diseases are to be ascribed."|FALSE
15707|"As far as I have been able to observe, the periods of inflammatory diseases"|FALSE
15707|"observe the solar day; as the gout and rheumatism have their greatest"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence about noon and midnight, and their exacerbations some hours"|FALSE
15707|"after; as they have more frequently their immediate cause from cold air,"|FALSE
15707|"inanition, or fatigue, than from the effects of lunations: whilst the cold"|FALSE
15707|"fits of hysteric patients, and those in nervous fevers, more frequently"|FALSE
15707|"occur twice a day, later by near half an hour each time, according to the"|FALSE
15707|"lunar day; whilst some fits of intermittents, which are undisturbed by"|FALSE
15707|"medicines, return at regular solar periods, and others at lunar ones; which"|FALSE
15707|"may, probably, be owing to the difference of the periods of those external"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances of cold, inanition, or lunation, which immediately caused"|FALSE
15707|"them."|FALSE
15707|"We must, however, observe, that the periods of quiescence and exacerbation"|FALSE
15707|"in diseases do not always commence at the times of the syzygies or"|FALSE
15707|"quadratures of the moon and sun, or at the times of their passing the"|FALSE
15707|"zenith or nadir; but as it is probable, that the stimulus of the particles"|FALSE
15707|"of the circumfluent blood is gradually diminished from the time of the"|FALSE
15707|"quadratures to that of the syzygies, the quiescence may commence at any"|FALSE
15707|"hour, when co-operating with other causes of quiescence, it becomes great"|FALSE
15707|"enough to produce a disease: afterwards it will continue to recur at the"|FALSE
15707|"same period of the lunar or solar influence; the same cause operating"|FALSE
15707|"conjointly with the acquired habit, that is with the catenation of this new"|FALSE
15707|"motion with the dissevered links of the lunar or solar circles of animal"|FALSE
15707|"action."|FALSE
15707|"In this manner the periods of menstruation obey the lunar month with great"|FALSE
15707|"exactness in healthy patients (and perhaps the venereal orgasm in brute"|FALSE
15707|"animals does the same), yet these periods do not commence either at the"|FALSE
15707|"syzygies or quadratures of the lunations, but at whatever time of the lunar"|FALSE
15707|"periods they begin, they observe the same in their returns till some"|FALSE
15707|"greater cause disturbs them."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, though the best way to calculate the time of the expected returns of"|FALSE
15707|"the paroxysms of periodical diseases is to count the number of hours"|FALSE
15707|"between the commencement of the two preceding fits, yet the following"|FALSE
15707|"observations may be worth attending to, when we endeavour to prevent the"|FALSE
15707|"returns of maniacal or epileptic diseases; whose periods (at the beginning"|FALSE
15707|"of them especially) frequently observe the syzygies of the moon and sun,"|FALSE
15707|"and particularly about the equinox."|FALSE
15707|"The greatest of the two tides happening in every revolution of the moon, is"|FALSE
15707|"that when the moon approaches nearest to the zenith or nadir; for this"|FALSE
15707|"reason, while the sun is in the northern signs, that is during the vernal"|FALSE
15707|"and summer months, the greater of the two diurnal tides in our latitude is"|FALSE
15707|"that, when the moon is above the horizon; and when the sun is in the"|FALSE
15707|"southern signs, or during the autumnal and winter months, the greater tide"|FALSE
15707|"is that, which arises when the moon is below the horizon: and as the sun"|FALSE
15707|"approaches somewhat nearer the earth in winter than in summer, the greatest"|FALSE
15707|"equinoctial tides are observed to be a little before the vernal equinox,"|FALSE
15707|"and a little after the autumnal one."|FALSE
15707|"Do not the cold periods of lunar diseases commence a few hours before the"|FALSE
15707|"southing of the moon during the vernal and summer months, and before the"|FALSE
15707|"northing of the moon during the autumnal and winter months? Do not palsies"|FALSE
15707|"and apoplexies, which occur about the equinoxes, happen a few days before"|FALSE
15707|"the vernal equinoctial lunation, and after the autumnal one? Are not the"|FALSE
15707|"periods of those diurnal diseases more obstinate, that commence many hours"|FALSE
15707|"before the southing or northing of the moon, than of those which commence"|FALSE
15707|"at those times? Are not those palsies and apoplexies more dangerous which"|FALSE
15707|"commence many days before the syzygies of the moon, than those which happen"|FALSE
15707|"at those times? See Sect. XXXVI. on the periods of diseases."|FALSE
15707|"VII. Another very frequent cause of the cold fit of fever is the quiescence"|FALSE
15707|"of some of those large congeries of glands, which compose the liver,"|FALSE
15707|"spleen, or pancreas; one or more of which are frequently so enlarged in the"|FALSE
15707|"autumnal intermittents as to be perceptible to the touch externally, and"|FALSE
15707|"are called by the vulgar ague-cakes. As these glands are stimulated into"|FALSE
15707|"action by the specific pungency of the fluids, which they absorb, the"|FALSE
15707|"general cause of their quiescence seems to be the too great insipidity of"|FALSE
15707|"the fluids of the body, co-operating perhaps at the same time with other"|FALSE
15707|"general causes of quiescence."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, in marshy countries at cold seasons, which have succeeded hot ones,"|FALSE
15707|"and amongst those, who have lived on innutritious and unstimulating diet,"|FALSE
15707|"these agues are most frequent. The enlargement of these quiescent viscera,"|FALSE
15707|"and the swelling of the præcordia in many other fevers, is, most probably,"|FALSE
15707|"owing to the same cause; which may consist in a general deficiency of the"|FALSE
15707|"production of sensorial power, as well as in the diminished stimulation of"|FALSE
15707|"the fluids; and when the quiescence of so great a number of glands, as"|FALSE
15707|"constitute one of those large viscera, commences, all the other irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions are affected by their connection with it, and the cold fit of fever"|FALSE
15707|"is produced."|FALSE
15707|"VIII. There are many other causes, which produce quiescence of some part of"|FALSE
15707|"the animal system, as fatigue, hunger, thirst, bad diet, disappointed love,"|FALSE
15707|"unwholesome air, exhaustion from evacuations, and many others; but the last"|FALSE
15707|"cause, that we shall mention, as frequently productive of cold fits of"|FALSE
15707|"fever, is fear or anxiety of mind. The pains, which we are first and most"|FALSE
15707|"generally acquainted with, have been produced by defect of some stimulus;"|FALSE
15707|"thus, soon after our nativity we become acquainted with the pain from the"|FALSE
15707|"coldness of the air, from the want of respiration, and from the want of"|FALSE
15707|"food. Now all these pains occasioned by defect of stimulus are attended"|FALSE
15707|"with quiescence of the organ, and at the same time with a greater or less"|FALSE
15707|"degree of quiescence of other parts of the system: thus, if we even endure"|FALSE
15707|"the pain of hunger so as to miss one meal instead of our daily habit of"|FALSE
15707|"repletion, not only the peristaltic motions of the stomach and bowels are"|FALSE
15707|"diminished, but we are more liable to coldness of our extremities, as of"|FALSE
15707|"our noses, and ears, and feet, than at other times."|FALSE
15707|"Now, as fear is originally excited by our having experienced pain, and is"|FALSE
15707|"itself a painful affection, the same quiescence of other fibrous motions"|FALSE
15707|"accompany it, as have been most frequently connected with this kind of"|FALSE
15707|"pain, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 1. as the coldness and paleness of the"|FALSE
15707|"skin, trembling, difficult respiration, indigestion, and other symptoms,"|FALSE
15707|"which contribute to form the cold fit of fevers. Anxiety is fear continued"|FALSE
15707|"through a longer time, and, by producing chronical torpor of the system,"|FALSE
15707|"extinguishes life slowly, by what is commonly termed a broken heart."|FALSE
15707|"IX. 1. We now step forwards to consider the other symptoms in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"of the quiescence which begins the fits of fever. If by any of the"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances before described, or by two or more of them acting at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time, a great degree of quiescence is induced on any considerable part"|FALSE
15707|"of the circle of irritative motions, the whole class of them is more or"|FALSE
15707|"less disturbed by their irritative associations. If this torpor be"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned by a deficient supply of sensorial power, and happens to any of"|FALSE
15707|"those parts of the system, which are accustomed to perpetual activity, as"|FALSE
15707|"the vital motions, the torpor increases rapidly, because of the great"|FALSE
15707|"expenditure of sensorial power by the incessant activity of those parts of"|FALSE
15707|"the system, as shewn in No. 3. 2. of this Section. Hence a deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"all the secretions succeeds, and as animal heat is produced in proportion"|FALSE
15707|"to the quantity of those secretions, the coldness of the skin is the first"|FALSE
15707|"circumstance, which is attended to. Dr. Martin asserts, that some parts of"|FALSE
15707|"his body were warmer than natural in the cold fit of fever; but it is"|FALSE
15707|"certain, that those, which are uncovered, as the fingers, and nose, and"|FALSE
15707|"ears, are much colder to the touch, and paler in appearance. It is"|FALSE
15707|"possible, that his experiments were made at the beginning of the subsequent"|FALSE
15707|"hot fits; which commence with partial distributions of heat, owing to some"|FALSE
15707|"parts of the body regaining their natural irritability sooner than others."|FALSE
15707|"From the quiescence of the anastomosing capillaries a paleness of the skin"|FALSE
15707|"succeeds, and a less secretion of the perspirable matter; from the"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence of the pulmonary capillaries a difficulty of respiration arises;"|FALSE
15707|"and from the quiescence of the other glands less bile, less gastric and"|FALSE
15707|"pancreatic juice, are secreted into the stomach and intestines, and less"|FALSE
15707|"mucus and saliva are poured into the mouth; whence arises the dry tongue,"|FALSE
15707|"costiveness, dry ulcers, and paucity of urine. From the quiescence of the"|FALSE
15707|"absorbent system arises the great thirst, as less moisture is absorbed from"|FALSE
15707|"the atmosphere. The absorption from the atmosphere was observed by Dr."|FALSE
15707|"Lyster to amount to eighteen ounces in one night, above what he had at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time insensibly perspired. See Langrish. On the same account the urine"|FALSE
15707|"is pale, though in small quantity, for the thinner part is not absorbed"|FALSE
15707|"from it; and when repeated ague-fits continue long, the legs swell from the"|FALSE
15707|"diminished absorption of the cellular absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"From the quiescence of the intestinal canal a loss of appetite and"|FALSE
15707|"flatulencies proceed. From the partial quiescence of the glandular viscera"|FALSE
15707|"a swelling and tension about the præcordia becomes sensible to the touch;"|FALSE
15707|"which is occasioned by the delay of the fluids from the defect of venous or"|FALSE
15707|"lymphatic absorption. The pain of the forehead, and of the limbs, and of"|FALSE
15707|"the small of the back, arises from the quiescence of the membranous fascia,"|FALSE
15707|"or muscles of those parts, in the same manner as the skin becomes painful,"|FALSE
15707|"when the vessels, of which it is composed, become quiescent from cold. The"|FALSE
15707|"trembling in consequence of the pain of coldness, the restlessness, and the"|FALSE
15707|"yawning, and stretching of the limbs, together with the shuddering, or"|FALSE
15707|"rigours, are convulsive motions; and will be explained amongst the diseases"|FALSE
15707|"of volition; Sect. XXXIV."|FALSE
15707|"Sickness and vomiting is a frequent symptom in the beginnings of"|FALSE
15707|"fever-fits, the muscular fibres of the stomach share the general torpor and"|FALSE
15707|"debility of the system; their motions become first lessened, and then stop,"|FALSE
15707|"and then become retrograde; for the act of vomiting, like the globus"|FALSE
15707|"hystericus and the borborigmi of hypochondriasis, is always a symptom of"|FALSE
15707|"debility, either from want of stimulus, as in hunger; or from want of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power, as after intoxication; or from sympathy with some other"|FALSE
15707|"torpid irritative motions, as in the cold fits of ague. See Sect. XII. 5."|FALSE
15707|"5. XXIX. 11. and XXXV. 1. 3. where this act of vomiting is further"|FALSE
15707|"explained."|FALSE
15707|"The small pulse, which is said by some writers to be slow at the"|FALSE
15707|"commencement of ague-fits, and which is frequently trembling and"|FALSE
15707|"intermittent, is owing to the quiescence of the heart and arterial system,"|FALSE
15707|"and to the resistance opposed to the circulating fluid from the inactivity"|FALSE
15707|"of all the glands and capillaries. The great weakness and inability to"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary motions, with the insensibility of the extremities, are owing to"|FALSE
15707|"the general quiescence of the whole moving system; or, perhaps, simply to"|FALSE
15707|"the deficient production of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"If all these symptoms are further increased, the quiescence of all the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles, including the heart and arteries, becomes complete, and death"|FALSE
15707|"ensues. This is, most probably, the case of those who are starved to death"|FALSE
15707|"with cold, and of those who are said to die in Holland from long skaiting"|FALSE
15707|"on their frozen canals."|FALSE
15707|"2. As soon as this general quiescence of the system ceases, either by the"|FALSE
15707|"diminution of the cause, or by the accumulation of sensorial power, (as in"|FALSE
15707|"syncope, Sect. XII. 7. 1.) which is the natural consequence of previous"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence, the hot fit commences. Every gland of the body is now"|FALSE
15707|"stimulated into stronger action than is natural, as its irritability is"|FALSE
15707|"increased by accumulation of sensorial power during its late quiescence, a"|FALSE
15707|"superabundance of all the secretions is produced, and an increase of heat"|FALSE
15707|"in consequence of the increase of these secretions. The skin becomes red,"|FALSE
15707|"and the perspiration great, owing to the increased action of the"|FALSE
15707|"capillaries during the hot part of the paroxysm. The secretion of"|FALSE
15707|"perspirable matter is perhaps greater during the hot fit than in the"|FALSE
15707|"sweating fit which follows; but as the absorption of it also is greater, it"|FALSE
15707|"does not stand on the skin in visible drops: add to this, that the"|FALSE
15707|"evaporation of it also is greater, from the increased heat of the skin. But"|FALSE
15707|"at the decline of the hot fit, as the mouths of the absorbents of the skin"|FALSE
15707|"are exposed to the cooler air, or bed-clothes, these vessels sooner lose"|FALSE
15707|"their increased activity, and cease to absorb more than their natural"|FALSE
15707|"quantity: but the secerning vessels for some time longer, being kept warm"|FALSE
15707|"by the circulating blood, continue to pour out an increased quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"perspirable matter, which now stands on the skin in large visible drops;"|FALSE
15707|"the exhalation of it also being lessened by the greater coolness of the"|FALSE
15707|"skin, as well as its absorption by the diminished action of the lymphatics."|FALSE
15707|"See Class I. 1. 2. 3."|FALSE
15707|"The increased secretion of bile and of other fluids poured into the"|FALSE
15707|"intestines frequently induce a purging at the decline of the hot fit; for"|FALSE
15707|"as the external absorbent vessels have their mouths exposed to the cold"|FALSE
15707|"air, as above mentioned, they cease to be excited into unnatural activity"|FALSE
15707|"sooner than the secretory vessels, whose mouths are exposed to the warmth"|FALSE
15707|"of the blood: now, as the internal absorbents sympathize with the external"|FALSE
15707|"ones, these also, which during the hot fit drank up the thinner part of the"|FALSE
15707|"bile, or of other secreted fluids, lose their increased activity before the"|FALSE
15707|"gland loses its increased activity, at the decline of the hot fit; and the"|FALSE
15707|"loose dejections are produced from the same cause, that the increased"|FALSE
15707|"perspiration stands on the surface of the skin, from the increased"|FALSE
15707|"absorption ceasing sooner than the increased secretion."|FALSE
15707|"The urine during the cold fit is in small quantity and pale, both from a"|FALSE
15707|"deficiency of the secretion and a deficiency of the absorption."|FALSE
15707|"During the hot fit it is in its usual quantity, but very high coloured and"|FALSE
15707|"turbid, because a greater quantity had been secreted by the increased"|FALSE
15707|"action of the kidnies, and also a greater quantity of its more aqueous part"|FALSE
15707|"had been absorbed from it in the bladder by the increased action of the"|FALSE
15707|"absorbents; and lastly, at the decline of the hot fit it is in large"|FALSE
15707|"quantity and less coloured, or turbid, because the absorbent vessels of the"|FALSE
15707|"bladder, as observed above, lose their increased action by sympathy with"|FALSE
15707|"the cutaneous ones sooner than the secretory vessels of the kidnies lose"|FALSE
15707|"their increased activity. Hence the quantity of the sediment, and the"|FALSE
15707|"colour of the urine, in fevers, depend much on the quantity secreted by the"|FALSE
15707|"kidnies, and the quantity absorbed from it again in the bladder: the kinds"|FALSE
15707|"of sediment, as the lateritious, purulent, mucous, or bloody sediments,"|FALSE
15707|"depend on other causes. It should be observed, that if the sweating be"|FALSE
15707|"increased by the heat of the room, or of the bed-clothes, that a paucity of"|FALSE
15707|"turbid urine will continue to be produced, as the absorbents of the bladder"|FALSE
15707|"will have their activity increased by their sympathy with the vessels of"|FALSE
15707|"the skin, for the purpose of supplying the fluid expended in perspiration."|FALSE
15707|"The pulse becomes strong and full owing to the increased irritability of"|FALSE
15707|"the heart and arteries, from the accumulation of sensorial power during"|FALSE
15707|"their quiescence, and to the quickness of the return of the blood from the"|FALSE
15707|"various glands and capillaries. This increased action of all the secretory"|FALSE
15707|"vessels does not occur very suddenly, nor universally at the same time. The"|FALSE
15707|"heat seems to begin about the center, and to be diffused from thence"|FALSE
15707|"irregularly to the other parts of the system. This may be owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"situation of the parts which first became quiescent and caused the"|FALSE
15707|"fever-fit, especially when a hardness or tumour about the præcordia can be"|FALSE
15707|"felt by the hand; and hence this part, in whatever viscus it is seated,"|FALSE
15707|"might be the first to regain its natural or increased irritability."|FALSE
15707|"3. It must be here noted, that, by the increased quantity of heat, and of"|FALSE
15707|"the impulse of the blood at the commencement of the hot fit, a great"|FALSE
15707|"increase of stimulus is induced, and is now added to the increased"|FALSE
15707|"irritability of the system, which was occasioned by its previous"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence. This additional stimulus of heat and momentum of the blood"|FALSE
15707|"augments the violence of the movements of the arterial and glandular system"|FALSE
15707|"in an increasing ratio. These violent exertions still producing more heat"|FALSE
15707|"and greater momentum of the moving fluids, till at length the sensoral"|FALSE
15707|"power becomes wasted by this great stimulus beneath its natural quantity,"|FALSE
15707|"and predisposes the system to a second cold fit."|FALSE
15707|"At length all these unnatural exertions spontaneously subside with the"|FALSE
15707|"increased irritability that produced them; and which was itself produced by"|FALSE
15707|"the preceding quiescence, in the same manner as the eye, on coming from"|FALSE
15707|"darkness into day-light, in a little time ceases to be dazzled and pained,"|FALSE
15707|"and gradually recovers its natural degree of irritability."|FALSE
15707|"4. But if the increase of irritability, and the consequent increase of the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of heat and momentum, produce more violent exertions than those"|FALSE
15707|"above described; great pain arises in some part of the moving system, as in"|FALSE
15707|"the membranes of the brain, pleura, or joints; and new motions of the"|FALSE
15707|"vessels are produced in consequence of this pain, which are called"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation; or delirium or stupor arises; as explained in Sect. XXI. and"|FALSE
15707|"XXXIII.: for the immediate effect is the same, whether the great energy of"|FALSE
15707|"the moving organs arises from an increase of stimulus or an increase of"|FALSE
15707|"irritability; though in the former case the waste of sensorial power leads"|FALSE
15707|"to debility, and in the latter to health."|FALSE
15707|"_Recapitulation._"|FALSE
15707|"X. Those muscles, which are less frequently exerted, and whose actions are"|FALSE
15707|"interrupted by sleep, acquire less accumulation of sensorial power during"|FALSE
15707|"their quiescent state, as the muscles of locomotion. In these muscles after"|FALSE
15707|"great exertion, that is, after great exhaustion of sensorial power, the"|FALSE
15707|"pain of fatigue ensues; and during rest there is a renovation of the"|FALSE
15707|"natural quantity of sensorial power; but where the rest, or quiescence of"|FALSE
15707|"the muscle, is long continued, a quantity of sensorial power becomes"|FALSE
15707|"accumulated beyond what is necessary; as appears by the uneasiness"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned by want of exercise; and which in young animals is one cause"|FALSE
15707|"exciting them into action, as is seen in the play of puppies and kittens."|FALSE
15707|"But when those muscles, which are habituated to perpetual actions, as those"|FALSE
15707|"of the stomach by the stimulus of food, those of the vessels of the skin by"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus of heat, and those which constitute the arteries and glands by"|FALSE
15707|"the stimulus of the blood, become for a time quiescent, from the want of"|FALSE
15707|"their appropriated stimuli, or by their associations with other quiescent"|FALSE
15707|"parts of the system; a greater accumulation of sensorial power is acquired"|FALSE
15707|"during their quiescence, and a greater or quicker exhaustion of it is"|FALSE
15707|"produced during their increased action."|FALSE
15707|"This accumulation of sensorial power from deficient action, if it happens"|FALSE
15707|"to the stomach from want of food, occasions the pain of hunger; if it"|FALSE
15707|"happens to the vessels of the skin from want of heat, it occasions the pain"|FALSE
15707|"of cold; and if to the arterial system from the want of its adapted"|FALSE
15707|"stimuli, many disagreeable sensations are occasioned, such as are"|FALSE
15707|"experienced in the cold fits of intermittent fevers, and are as various, as"|FALSE
15707|"there are glands or membranes in the system, and are generally termed"|FALSE
15707|"universal uneasiness."|FALSE
15707|"When the quiescence of the arterial system is not owing to defect of"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus as above, but to the defective quantity of sensorial power, as in"|FALSE
15707|"the commencement of nervous fever, or irritative fever with weak pulse, a"|FALSE
15707|"great torpor of this system is quickly induced; because both the irritation"|FALSE
15707|"from the stimulus of the blood, and the association of the vascular motions"|FALSE
15707|"with each other, continue to excite the arteries into action, and thence"|FALSE
15707|"quickly exhaust the ill-supplied vascular muscles; for to rest is death;"|FALSE
15707|"and therefore those vascular muscles continue to proceed, though with"|FALSE
15707|"feebler action, to the extreme of weariness or faintness: while nothing"|FALSE
15707|"similar to this affects the locomotive muscles, whose actions are generally"|FALSE
15707|"caused by volition, and not much subject either to irritation or to other"|FALSE
15707|"kinds of associations besides the voluntary ones, except indeed when they"|FALSE
15707|"are excited by the lash of slavery."|FALSE
15707|"In these vascular muscles, which are subject to perpetual action, and"|FALSE
15707|"thence liable to great accumulation of sensorial power during their"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence from want of stimulus, a great increase of activity occurs,"|FALSE
15707|"either from the renewal of their accustomed stimulus, or even from much"|FALSE
15707|"less quantities of stimulus than usual. This increase of action constitutes"|FALSE
15707|"the hot fit of fever, which is attended with various increased secretions,"|FALSE
15707|"with great concomitant heat, and general uneasiness. The uneasiness"|FALSE
15707|"attending this hot paroxysm of fever, or fit of exertion, is very different"|FALSE
15707|"from that, which attends the previous cold fit, or fit of quiescence, and"|FALSE
15707|"is frequently the cause of inflammation, as in pleurisy, which is treated"|FALSE
15707|"of in the next section."|FALSE
15707|"A similar effect occurs after the quiescence of our organs of sense; those"|FALSE
15707|"which are not subject to perpetual action, as the taste and smell, are less"|FALSE
15707|"liable to an exuberant accumulation of sensorial power after their having"|FALSE

15707|"which consists in the partial distribution of it, as appears in partial"|FALSE

15707|"There are also many uneasy sensations attending these increased actions,"|FALSE
15707|"which, like those belonging to the hot fit of fever with strong pulse, are"|FALSE
15707|"frequently followed by inflammation, as in scarlet fever; which"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation is nevertheless accompanied with a pulse weaker, though"|FALSE
15707|"quicker, than the pulse during the remission or intermission of the"|FALSE

15707|"From hence I conclude, that both the cold and hot fits of fever are"|FALSE

15707|"Besides the pleasure, which attends the irritations produced by the objects"|FALSE

15707|"This quantity or sum of pleasurable affection, seems to contribute to the"|FALSE
15707|"due or energetic performance of the whole moveable system, as well that of"|FALSE
15707|"the heart and arteries, as of digestion and of absorption; since without"|FALSE

15707|"2. Besides the febrile motions occasioned by irritation, described in Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XXXII. and termed irritative fever, it frequently happens that pain is"|FALSE
15707|"excited by the violence of the fibrous contractions; and other new motions"|FALSE
15707|"are then superadded, in consequence of sensation, which we shall term"|FALSE
15707|"febris sensitiva, or sensitive fever. It must be observed, that most"|FALSE
15707|"irritative fevers begin with a decreased exertion of irritation, owing to"|FALSE
15707|"defect of stimulus; but that on the contrary the sensitive fevers, or"|FALSE
15707|"inflammations, generally begin with the increased exertion of sensation, as"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned in Sect. XXXI. on temperaments: for though the cold fit, which"|FALSE
15707|"introduces inflammation, commences with decreased irritation, yet the"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation itself commences in the hot fit during the increase of"|FALSE
15707|"sensation. Thus a common pustule, or phlegmon, in a part of little"|FALSE
15707|"sensibility does not excite an inflammatory fever; but if the stomach,"|FALSE
15707|"intestines, or the tender substance beneath the nails, be injured, great"|FALSE
15707|"sensation is produced, and the whole system is thrown into that kind of"|FALSE
15707|"exertion, which constitutes inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"These sensitive fevers, like the irritative ones, resolve themselves into"|FALSE
15707|"those with arterial strength, and those with arterial debility, that is"|FALSE
15707|"with excess or defect of sensorial power; these may be termed the febris"|FALSE
15707|"sensitiva pulsu forti, sensitive fever with strong pulse, which is the"|FALSE
15707|"synocha, or inflammatory fever; and the febris sensitiva pulsu debili,"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive fever with weak pulse, which is the typhus gravior, or putrid"|FALSE
15707|"fever of some writers."|FALSE
15707|"3. The inflammatory fevers, which are here termed sensitive fevers with"|FALSE
15707|"strong pulse, are generally attended with some topical inflammation, as"|FALSE
15707|"pleurisy, peripneumony, or rheumatism, which distinguishes them from"|FALSE
15707|"irritative fevers with strong pulse. The pulse is strong, quick, and full;"|FALSE
15707|"for in this fever there is great irritation, as well as great sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"employed in moving the arterial system. The size, or coagulable lymph,"|FALSE
15707|"which appears on the blood, is probably an increased secretion from the"|FALSE
15707|"inflamed internal lining of the whole arterial system, the thinner part"|FALSE
15707|"being taken away by the increased absorption of the inflamed lymphatics."|FALSE
15707|"The sensitive fevers with weak pulse, which are termed putrid or malignant"|FALSE
15707|"fevers, are distinguished from irritative fevers with weak pulse, called"|FALSE
15707|"nervous fevers, described in the last section, as the former consist of"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation joined with debility, and the latter of debility alone. Hence"|FALSE
15707|"there is greater heat and more florid colour of the skin in the former,"|FALSE
15707|"with petechiæ, or purple spots, and aphthæ, or sloughs in the throat, and"|FALSE
15707|"generally with previous contagion."|FALSE
15707|"When animal matter dies, as a slough in the throat, or the mortified part"|FALSE
15707|"of a carbuncle, if it be kept moist and warm, as during its abhesion to a"|FALSE
15707|"living body, it will soon putrify. This, and the origin of contagion from"|FALSE
15707|"putrid animal substances, seem to have given rise to the septic and"|FALSE
15707|"antiseptic theory of these fevers."|FALSE
15707|"The matter in pustules and ulcers is thus liable to become putrid, and to"|FALSE
15707|"produce microscopic animalcula; the urine, if too long retained, may also"|FALSE
15707|"gain a putrescent smell, as well as the alvine feces; but some writers have"|FALSE
15707|"gone so far as to believe, that the blood itself in these fevers has smelt"|FALSE
15707|"putrid, when drawn from the arm of the patient: but this seems not well"|FALSE
15707|"founded; since a single particle of putrid matter taken into the blood can"|FALSE
15707|"produce fever, how can we conceive that the whole mass could continue a"|FALSE
15707|"minute in a putrid state without destroying life? Add to this, that putrid"|FALSE
15707|"animal substances give up air, as in gangrenes; and that hence if the blood"|FALSE
15707|"was putrid, air should be given out, which in the blood-vessels is known to"|FALSE
15707|"occasion immediate death."|FALSE
15707|"In these sensitive fevers with strong pulse (or inflammations) there are"|FALSE
15707|"two sensorial faculties concerned in producing the disease, viz. irritation"|FALSE
15707|"and sensation; and hence, as their combined action is more violent, the"|FALSE
15707|"general quantity of sensorial power becomes further exhausted during the"|FALSE
15707|"exacerbation, and the system more rapidly weakened than in irritative fever"|FALSE
15707|"with strong pulse; where the spirit of animation is weakened by but one"|FALSE
15707|"mode of its exertion: so that this febris sensitiva pulsu forti (or"|FALSE
15707|"inflammatory fever,) may be considered as the febris irritativa pulsu"|FALSE
15707|"forti, with the addition of inflammation; and the febris sensitiva pulsu"|FALSE
15707|"debili (or malignant fever) may be considered as the febris irritativa"|FALSE
15707|"pulsu debili (or nervous fever), with the addition of inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"4. In these putrid or malignant fevers a deficiency of irritability"|FALSE
15707|"accompanies the increase of sensibility; and by this waste of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power by the excess of sensation, which was already too small, arises the"|FALSE
15707|"delirium and stupor which so perpetually attend these inflammatory fevers"|FALSE
15707|"with arterial debility. In these cases the voluntary power first ceases to"|FALSE
15707|"act from deficiency of sensorial spirit; and the stimuli from external"|FALSE
15707|"bodies have no effect on the exhausted sensorial power, and a delirium like"|FALSE
15707|"a dream is the consequence. At length the internal stimuli cease to excite"|FALSE
15707|"sufficient irritation, and the secretions are either not produced at all,"|FALSE
15707|"or too parsimonious in quantity. Amongst these the secretion of the brain,"|FALSE
15707|"or production of the sensorial power, becomes deficient, till at last all"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power ceases, except what is just necessary to perform the vital"|FALSE
15707|"motions, and a stupor succeeds; which is thus owing to the same cause as"|FALSE
15707|"the preceding delirium exerted in a greater degree."|FALSE
15707|"This kind of delirium is owing to a suspension of volition, and to the"|FALSE
15707|"disobedience of the senses to external stimuli, and is always occasioned by"|FALSE
15707|"great debility, or paucity of sensorial power; it is therefore a bad sign"|FALSE
15707|"at the end of inflammatory fevers, which had previous arterial strength, as"|FALSE
15707|"rheumatism, or pleurisy, as it shews the presence of great exhaustion of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power in a system, which having lately been exposed to great"|FALSE
15707|"excitement, is not so liable to be stimulated into its healthy action,"|FALSE
15707|"either by additional stimulus of food and medicines, or by the accumulation"|FALSE
15707|"of sensorial power during its present torpor. In inflammatory fevers with"|FALSE
15707|"debility, as those termed putrid fevers, delirium is sometimes, as well as"|FALSE
15707|"stupor, rather a favourable sign; as less sensorial power is wasted during"|FALSE
15707|"its continuance (see Class II. 1. 6. 8.), and the constitution not having"|FALSE
15707|"been previously exposed to excess of stimulation, is more liable to be"|FALSE
15707|"excited after previous quiescence."|FALSE
15707|"When the sum of general pleasurable sensation becomes too great, another"|FALSE
15707|"kind of delirium supervenes, and the ideas thus excited are mistaken for"|FALSE
15707|"the irritations of external objects: such a delirium is produced for a time"|FALSE
15707|"by intoxicating drugs, as fermented liquors, or opium: a permanent delirium"|FALSE
15707|"of this kind is sometimes induced by the pleasures of inordinate vanity, or"|FALSE
15707|"by the enthusiastic hopes of heaven. In these cases the power of volition"|FALSE
15707|"is incapable of exertion, and in a great degree the external senses become"|FALSE
15707|"incapable of perceiving their adapted stimuli, because the whole sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power is employed or expended on the ideas excited by pleasurable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation."|FALSE
15707|"This kind of delirium is distinguished from that which attends the fevers"|FALSE
15707|"above mentioned from its not being accompanied with general debility, but"|FALSE
15707|"simply with excess of pleasurable sensation; and is therefore in some"|FALSE
15707|"measure allied to madness or to reverie; it differs from the delirium of"|FALSE
15707|"dreams, as in this the power of volition is not totally suspended, nor are"|FALSE
15707|"the senses precluded from external stimulation; there is therefore a degree"|FALSE
15707|"of consistency, in this kind of delirium, and a degree of attention to"|FALSE
15707|"external objects, neither of which exist in the delirium of fevers or in"|FALSE
15707|"dreams."|FALSE
15707|"5. It would appear, that the vascular system of other animals are less"|FALSE
15707|"liable to be put into action by their general sum of pleasurable or painful"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; and that the trains of their ideas, and the muscular motions"|FALSE
15707|"usually associated with them, are less powerfully connected than in the"|FALSE
15707|"human system. For other animals neither weep, nor smile, nor laugh; and are"|FALSE
15707|"hence seldom subject to delirium, as treated of in Sect. XVI. on Instinct."|FALSE
15707|"Now as our epidemic and contagious diseases are probably produced by"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation, and not simply by irritation; there appears a"|FALSE
15707|"reason, why brute animals are less liable to epidemic or contagious"|FALSE
15707|"diseases; and secondly, why none of our contagions, as the small-pox or"|FALSE
15707|"measles, can be communicated to them, though one of theirs, viz. the"|FALSE
15707|"hydrophobia, as well as many of their poisons, as those of snakes and of in"|FALSE
15707|"insects, communicate their deleterious or painful effects to mankind."|FALSE
15707|"Where the quantity of general painful sensation is too great in the system,"|FALSE
15707|"inordinate voluntary exertions are produced either of our ideas, as in"|FALSE
15707|"melancholy and madness, or of our muscles, as in convulsion. From these"|FALSE
15707|"maladies also brute animals are much more exempt than mankind, owing to"|FALSE
15707|"their greater inaptitude to voluntary exertion, as mentioned in Sect. XVI."|FALSE
15707|"on Instinct."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. When any moving organ is excited into such violent motions, that a"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of pleasurable or painful sensation is produced, it frequently"|FALSE
15707|"happens (but not always) that new motions of the affected organ are"|FALSE
15707|"generated in consequence of the pain or pleasure, which are termed"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"These new motions are of a peculiar kind, tending to distend the old, and"|FALSE
15707|"to produce new fibres, and thence to elongate the straight muscles, which"|FALSE
15707|"serve locomotion, and to form new vessels at the extremities or sides of"|FALSE
15707|"the vascular muscles."|FALSE
15707|"2. Thus the pleasurable sensations produce an enlargement of the nipples of"|FALSE
15707|"nurses, of the papillæ of the tongue, of the penis, and probably produce"|FALSE
15707|"the growth of the body from its embryon state to its maturity; whilst the"|FALSE
15707|"new motions in consequence of painful sensation, with the growth of the"|FALSE
15707|"fibres or vessels, which they occasion, are termed inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"Hence when the straight muscles are inflamed, part of their tendons at each"|FALSE
15707|"extremity gain new life and sensibility, and thus the muscle is for a time"|FALSE
15707|"elongated; and inflamed bones become soft, vascular, and sensible. Thus new"|FALSE
15707|"vessels shoot over the cornea of inflamed eyes, and into scirrhous tumours,"|FALSE
15707|"when they become inflamed; and hence all inflamed parts grow together by"|FALSE
15707|"intermixture, and inosculation of the new and old vessels."|FALSE
15707|"The heat is occasioned from the increased secretions either of mucus, or of"|FALSE
15707|"the fibres, which produce or elongate the vessels. The red colour is owing"|FALSE
15707|"to the pellucidity of the newly formed vessels, and as the arterial parts"|FALSE
15707|"of them are probably formed before their correspondent venous parts."|FALSE
15707|"3. These new motions are excited either from the increased quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"sensation in consequence of greater fibrous contractions, or from increased"|FALSE
15707|"sensibility, that is, from the increased quantity of sensorial power in the"|FALSE
15707|"moving organ. Hence they are induced by great external stimuli, as by"|FALSE
15707|"wounds, broken bones; and by acrid or infectious materials; or by common"|FALSE
15707|"stimuli on those organs, which have been some time quiescent; as the usual"|FALSE
15707|"light of the day inflames the eyes of those, who have been confined in"|FALSE
15707|"dungeons; and the warmth of a common fire inflames those, who have been"|FALSE
15707|"previously exposed to much cold."|FALSE
15707|"But these new motions are never generated by that pain, which arises from"|FALSE
15707|"defect of stimulus, as from hunger, thirst, cold, or inanition, with all"|FALSE
15707|"those pains, which are termed nervous. Where these pains exist, the motions"|FALSE
15707|"of the affected part are lessened; and if inflammation succeeds, it is in"|FALSE
15707|"some distant parts; as coughs are caused by coldness and moisture being"|FALSE
15707|"long applied to the feet; or it is in consequence of the renewal of the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, as of heat or food, which excites our organs into stronger action"|FALSE
15707|"after their temporary quiescence; as kibed heels after walking in snow."|FALSE
15707|"4. But when these new motions of the vascular muscles are exerted with"|FALSE
15707|"greater violence, and these vessels are either elongated too much or too"|FALSE
15707|"hastily, a new material is secreted from their extremities, which is of"|FALSE
15707|"various kinds according to the peculiar animal motions of this new kind of"|FALSE
15707|"gland, which secretes it; such is the pus laudabile or common matter, the"|FALSE
15707|"variolous matter, venereal matter, catarrhous matter, and many others."|FALSE
15707|"5. These matters are the product of an animal process; they are secreted or"|FALSE
15707|"produced from the blood by certain diseased motions of the extremities of"|FALSE
15707|"the blood-vessels, and are on that account all of them contagious; for if a"|FALSE
15707|"portion of any of these matters is transmitted into the circulation, or"|FALSE
15707|"perhaps only inserted into the skin, or beneath the cuticle of an healthy"|FALSE
15707|"person, its stimulus in a certain time produces the same kind of morbid"|FALSE
15707|"motions, by which itself was produced; and hence a similar kind is"|FALSE
15707|"generated. See Sect. XXXIX. 6. 1."|FALSE
15707|"6. It is remarkable, that many of these contagious matters are capable of"|FALSE
15707|"producing a similar disease but once; as the small-pox and measles; and I"|FALSE
15707|"suppose this is true of all those contagious diseases, which are"|FALSE
15707|"spontaneously cured by nature in a certain time; for if the body was"|FALSE
15707|"capable of receiving the disease a second time, the patient must"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually infect himself by the very matter, which he has himself"|FALSE
15707|"produced, and is lodged about him; and hence he could never become free"|FALSE
15707|"from the disease. Something similar to this is seen in the secondary fever"|FALSE
15707|"of the confluent small-pox; there is a great absorption of variolous"|FALSE
15707|"matter, a very minute part of which would give the genuine small-pox to"|FALSE
15707|"another person; but here it only stimulates the system into common fever;"|FALSE
15707|"like that which common puss, or any other acrid material might occasion."|FALSE
15707|"7. In the pulmonary consumption, where common matter is daily absorbed, an"|FALSE
15707|"irritative fever only, without new inflammation, is generally produced;"|FALSE
15707|"which is terminated like other irritative fevers by sweats, or loose"|FALSE
15707|"stools. Hence it does not appear, that this absorbed matter always acts as"|FALSE
15707|"a contagious material producing fresh inflammation or new abscesses. Though"|FALSE
15707|"there is reason to believe, that the first time any common matter is"|FALSE
15707|"absorbed, it has this effect, but not the second time, like the variolous"|FALSE
15707|"matter above mentioned."|FALSE
15707|"This accounts for the opinion, that the pulmonary consumption is sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"infectious, which opinion was held by the ancients, and continues in Italy"|FALSE
15707|"at present; and I have myself seen three or four instances, where a husband"|FALSE
15707|"and wife, who have slept together, and have thus much received each other's"|FALSE
15707|"breath, who have infected each other, and both died in consequence of the"|FALSE
15707|"original taint of only one of them. This also accounts for the abscesses in"|FALSE
15707|"various parts of the body, that are sometimes produced after the inoculated"|FALSE
15707|"small-pox is terminated; for this second absorption of variolous matter"|FALSE
15707|"acts like common matter, and produces only irritative fever in those"|FALSE
15707|"children, whose constitutions have already experienced the absorption of"|FALSE
15707|"common matter; and inflammation with a tendency to produce new abscesses in"|FALSE
15707|"those, whose constitutions have not experienced the absorptions of common"|FALSE
15707|"matter."|FALSE
15707|"It is probable, that more certain proofs might have been found to shew,"|FALSE
15707|"that common matter is infectious the first time it is absorbed, tending to"|FALSE
15707|"produce similar abscesses, but not the second time of its absorption, if"|FALSE
15707|"this subject had been attended to."|FALSE
15707|"8. These contagious diseases are very numerous, as the plague, small-pox,"|FALSE
15707|"chicken-pox, measles, scarlet-fever, pemphigus, catarrh, chincough,"|FALSE
15707|"venereal disease, itch, trichoma, tinea. The infectious material does not"|FALSE
15707|"seem to be dissolved by the air, but only mixed with it perhaps in fine"|FALSE
15707|"powder, which soon subsides; since many of these contagions can only be"|FALSE
15707|"received by actual contact; and others of them only at small distances from"|FALSE
15707|"the infected person; as is evident from many persons having been near"|FALSE
15707|"patients of the small-pox without acquiring the disease."|FALSE
15707|"The reason, why many of these diseases are received but once, and others"|FALSE
15707|"repeatedly, is not well understood; it appears to me, that the constitution"|FALSE
15707|"becomes so accustomed to the stimuli of these infectious materials, by"|FALSE
15707|"having once experienced them, that though irritative motions, as hectic"|FALSE
15707|"fevers, may again be produced by them, yet no sensation, and in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"no general inflammation succeeds; as disagreeable smells or tastes by habit"|FALSE
15707|"cease to be perceived; they continue indeed to excite irritative ideas on"|FALSE
15707|"the organs of sense, but these are not succeeded by sensation."|FALSE
15707|"There are many irritative motions, which were at first succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, but which by frequent repetition cease to excite sensation, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in Sect. XX. on Vertigo. And, that this circumstance exists in"|FALSE
15707|"respect to infectious matter appears from a known fact; that nurses, who"|FALSE
15707|"have had the small-pox, are liable to experience small ulcers on their arms"|FALSE
15707|"by the contact of variolous matter in lifting their patients; and that when"|FALSE
15707|"patients, who have formerly had the small-pox have been inoculated in the"|FALSE
15707|"arm, a phlegmon, or inflamed sore, has succeeded, but no subsequent fever."|FALSE
15707|"Which shews, that the contagious matter of the small-pox has not lost its"|FALSE
15707|"power of stimulating the part it is applied to, but that the general system"|FALSE
15707|"is not affected in consequence. See Section XII. 7. 6. XIX. 9."|FALSE
15707|"9. From the accounts of the plague, virulent catarrh, and putrid dysentery,"|FALSE
15707|"it seems uncertain, whether these diseases are experienced more than once;"|FALSE
15707|"but the venereal disease and itch are doubtless repeatedly infectious; and"|FALSE
15707|"as these diseases are never cured spontaneously, but require medicines,"|FALSE
15707|"which act without apparent operation, some have suspected, that the"|FALSE
15707|"contagious material produces similar matter rather by a chemical change of"|FALSE
15707|"the fluids, than by an animal process; and that the specific medicines"|FALSE
15707|"destroy their virus by chemically combining with it. This opinion is"|FALSE
15707|"successfully combated by Mr. Hunter, in his Treatise on Venereal Disease,"|FALSE
15707|"Part I. c. i."|FALSE
15707|"But this opinion wants the support of analogy, as there is no known process"|FALSE
15707|"in animal bodies, which is purely chemical, not even digestion; nor can any"|FALSE
15707|"of these matters be produced by chemical processes. Add to this, that it is"|FALSE
15707|"probable, that the insects, observed in the pustules of the itch, and in"|FALSE
15707|"the stools of dysenteric patients, are the consequences, and not the causes"|FALSE
15707|"of these diseases. And that the specific medicines, which cure the itch and"|FALSE
15707|"lues venerea, as brimstone and mercury, act only by increasing the"|FALSE
15707|"absorption of the matter in the ulcuscles of those diseases, and thence"|FALSE
15707|"disposing them to heal; which would otherwise continue to spread."|FALSE
15707|"Why the venereal disease, and itch, and tenia, or scald head, are"|FALSE
15707|"repeatedly contagious, while those contagions attended with fever can be"|FALSE
15707|"received but once, seems to depend on their being rather local diseases"|FALSE
15707|"than universal ones, and are hence not attended with fever, except the"|FALSE
15707|"purulent fever in their last stages, when the patient is destroyed by them."|FALSE
15707|"On this account the whole of the system does not become habituated to these"|FALSE
15707|"morbid actions, so as to cease to be affected with sensation by a"|FALSE
15707|"repetition of the contagion. Thus the contagious matter of the venereal"|FALSE
15707|"disease, and of the tenia, affects the lymphatic glands, as the inquinal"|FALSE
15707|"glands, and those about the roots of the hair and neck, where it is"|FALSE
15707|"arrested, but does not seem to affect the blood-vessels, since no fever"|FALSE
15707|"ensues."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it would appear, that these kinds of contagion are propagated not by"|FALSE
15707|"means of the circulation, but by sympathy of distant parts with each other;"|FALSE
15707|"since if a distant part, as the palate, should be excited by sensitive"|FALSE
15707|"association into the same kind of motions, as the parts originally affected"|FALSE
15707|"by the contact of infectious matter; that distant part will produce the"|FALSE
15707|"same kind of infectious matter; for every secretion from the blood is"|FALSE
15707|"formed from it by the peculiar motions of the fine extremities of the"|FALSE
15707|"gland, which secretes it; the various secreted fluids, as the bile, saliva,"|FALSE
15707|"gastric juice, not previously existing, as such, in the blood-vessels."|FALSE
15707|"And this peculiar sympathy between the genitals and the throat, owing to"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive association, appears not only in the production of venereal"|FALSE
15707|"ulcers in the throat, but in variety of other instances, as in the mumps,"|FALSE
15707|"in the hydrophobia, some coughs, strangulation, the production of the"|FALSE
15707|"beard, change of voice at puberty. Which are further described in Class IV."|FALSE
15707|"1. 2. 7."|FALSE
15707|"To evince that the production of such large quantities of contagious"|FALSE
15707|"matter, as are seen in some variolous patients, so as to cover the whole"|FALSE
15707|"skin almost with pustules, does not arise from any chemical fermentation in"|FALSE
15707|"the blood, but that it is owing to morbid motions of the fine extremities"|FALSE
15707|"of the capillaries, or glands, whether these be ruptured or not, appears"|FALSE
15707|"from the quantity of this matter always corresponding with the quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"the fever; that is, with the violent exertions of those glands and"|FALSE
15707|"capillaries, which are the terminations of the arterial system."|FALSE
15707|"The truth of this theory is evinced further by a circumstance observed by"|FALSE
15707|"Mr. J. Hunter, in his Treatise on Venereal Disease; that in a patient, who"|FALSE
15707|"was inoculated for the small-pox, and who appeared afterwards to have been"|FALSE
15707|"previously infested with the measles, the progress of the small-pox was"|FALSE
15707|"delayed till the measles had run their course, and that then the small-pox"|FALSE
15707|"went through its usual periods."|FALSE
15707|"Two similar cases fell under my care, which I shall here relate, as it"|FALSE
15707|"confirms that of Mr. Hunter, and contributes to illustrate this part of the"|FALSE
15707|"theory of contagious diseases. I have transcribed the particulars from a"|FALSE
15707|"letter of Mr. Lightwood of Yoxal, the surgeon who daily attended them, and"|FALSE
15707|"at my request, after I had seen them, kept a kind of journal of their"|FALSE
15707|"cases."|FALSE
15707|"Miss H. and Miss L. two sisters, the one about four and the other about"|FALSE
15707|"three years old, were inoculated Feb. 7, 1791. On the 10th there was a"|FALSE
15707|"redness on both arms discernible by a glass. On the 11th their arms were so"|FALSE
15707|"much inflamed as to leave no doubt of the infection having taken place. On"|FALSE
15707|"the 12th less appearance of inflammation on their arms. In the evening Miss"|FALSE
15707|"L. had an eruption, which resembled the measles. On the 12th the eruption"|FALSE
15707|"on Miss L. was very full on the face and breast, like the measles, with"|FALSE
15707|"considerable fever. It was now known, that the measles were in a farm house"|FALSE
15707|"in the neighbourhood. Miss H.'s arm less inflamed than yesterday. On the"|FALSE
15707|"14th Miss L.'s fever great, and the eruption universal. The arm appears to"|FALSE
15707|"be healed. Miss H.'s arm somewhat redder. They were now put into separate"|FALSE
15707|"rooms. On the 15th Miss L.'s arms as yesterday. Eruption continues. Miss"|FALSE
15707|"H.'s arms have varied but little. 16th, the eruptions on Miss L. are dying"|FALSE
15707|"away, her fever gone. Begins to have a little redness in one arm at the"|FALSE
15707|"place of inoculation. Miss H.'s arms get redder, but she has no appearance"|FALSE
15707|"of complaint. 20th, Miss L.'s arms have advanced slowly till this day, and"|FALSE
15707|"now a few pustules appear. Miss H.'s arm has made little progress from the"|FALSE
15707|"16th to this day, and now she has some fever. 21st, Miss L. as yesterday."|FALSE
15707|"Miss H. has much inflammation, and an increase of the red circle on one arm"|FALSE
15707|"to the size of half a crown, and had much fever at night, with fetid"|FALSE
15707|"breath. 22d, Miss L.'s pustules continue advancing. Miss H.'s inflammation"|FALSE
15707|"of her arm and red circle increases. A few red spots appear in different"|FALSE
15707|"parts with some degree of fever this morning, 23d. Miss L. has a larger"|FALSE
15707|"crop of pustules. Miss H. has small pustules and great inflammation of her"|FALSE
15707|"arms, with but one pustule likely to suppurate. After this day they"|FALSE
15707|"gradually got well, and the pustules disappeared."|FALSE
15707|"In one of these cases the measles went through their common course with"|FALSE
15707|"milder symptoms than usual, and in the other the measly contagion seemed"|FALSE
15707|"just sufficient to stop the progress of variolous contagion, but without"|FALSE
15707|"itself throwing the constitution into any disorder. At the same time both"|FALSE
15707|"the measles and small-pox seem to have been rendered milder. Does not this"|FALSE
15707|"give an idea, that if they were both inoculated at the same time, that"|FALSE
15707|"neither of them might affect the patient?"|FALSE
15707|"From these cases I contend, that the contagious matter of these diseases"|FALSE
15707|"does not affect the constitution by a fermentation, or chemical change of"|FALSE
15707|"the blood, because then they must have proceeded together, and have"|FALSE
15707|"produced a third something, not exactly similar to either of them: but that"|FALSE
15707|"they produce new motions of the cutaneous terminations of the"|FALSE
15707|"blood-vessels, which for a time proceed daily with increasing activity,"|FALSE
15707|"like some paroxysms of fever, till they at length secrete or form a similar"|FALSE
15707|"poison by these unnatural actions."|FALSE
15707|"Now as in the measles one kind of unnatural motion takes place, and in the"|FALSE
15707|"small-pox another kind, it is easy to conceive, that these different kinds"|FALSE
15707|"of morbid motions cannot exist together; and therefore, that that which has"|FALSE
15707|"first begun will continue till the system becomes habituated to the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus which occasions it, and has ceased to be thrown into action by it;"|FALSE
15707|"and then the other kind of stimulus will in its turn produce fever, and new"|FALSE
15707|"kinds of motions peculiar to itself."|FALSE
15707|"10. On further considering the action of contagious matter, since the"|FALSE
15707|"former part of this work was sent to the press; where I have asserted, in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XXII. 3. 3. that it is probable, that the variolous matter is"|FALSE
15707|"diffused through the blood; I prevailed on my friend Mr. Power, surgeon at"|FALSE
15707|"Bosworth in Leicestershire to try, whether the small-pox could be"|FALSE
15707|"inoculated by using the blood of a variolous patient instead of the matter"|FALSE
15707|"from the pustules; as I thought such an experiment might throw some light"|FALSE
15707|"at least on this interesting subject. The following is an extract from his"|FALSE
15707|"letter:--"|FALSE
15707|"\"March 11, 1793. I inoculated two children, who had not had the small-pox,"|FALSE

15707|"Mr. Power afterwards observes, that, as the patients from whom the blood"|FALSE

15707|"Shall we conclude from hence, that the variolous matter never enters the"|FALSE

15707|"circle for six or seven days; that then their quantity of morbid action"|FALSE
15707|"becomes great enough to produce a fever-fit, and to affect the stomach by"|FALSE
15707|"association of motions? and finally, that a second association of motions"|FALSE
15707|"is produced between the stomach and the other parts of the skin, inducing"|FALSE
15707|"them into morbid actions similar to those of the circle round the insertion"|FALSE
15707|"of the variolous matter? Many more experiments and observations are"|FALSE
15707|"required before this important question can be satisfactorily answered."|FALSE
15707|"It may be adduced, that as the matter inserted into the skin of the arm"|FALSE
15707|"frequently swells the lymphatic in the axilla, that in that circumstance it"|FALSE

15707|"the blood by that lymphatic gland till the swelling of it subsides. Some"|FALSE
15707|"other phænomena of the disease are more easily reconcileable to this theory"|FALSE
15707|"of sympathetic motions than to that of absorption; as the time taken up"|FALSE
15707|"between the insertion of the matter, and the operation of it on the system,"|FALSE
15707|"as mentioned above. For the circle around the insertion is seen to"|FALSE
15707|"increase, and to inflame; and I believe, undergoes a kind of diurnal"|FALSE
15707|"paroxysm of torpor and paleness with a succeeding increase of action and"|FALSE
15707|"colour, like a topical fever-fit. Whereas if the matter is conceived to"|FALSE
15707|"circulate for six or seven days with the blood, without producing disorder,"|FALSE
15707|"it ought to be rendered milder, or the blood-vessels more familiarized to"|FALSE
15707|"its acrimony."|FALSE
15707|"It is much easier to conceive from this doctrine of associated or"|FALSE
15707|"sympathetic motions of distant parts of the system, how it happens, that"|FALSE
15707|"the variolous infection can be received but once, as before explained; than"|FALSE
15707|"by supposing, that a change is effected in the mass of blood by any kind of"|FALSE
15707|"fermentative process."|FALSE
15707|"The curious circumstance of the two contagions of small-pox and measles not"|FALSE
15707|"acting at the same time, but one of them resting or suspending its action"|FALSE
15707|"till that of the other ceases, may be much easier explained from"|FALSE
15707|"sympathetic or associated actions of the infected part with other parts of"|FALSE
15707|"the system, than it can from supposing the two contagions to enter the"|FALSE
15707|"circulation."|FALSE
15707|"The skin of the face is subject to more frequent vicissitudes of heat and"|FALSE
15707|"cold, from its exposure to the open air, and is in consequence more liable"|FALSE
15707|"to sensitive association with the stomach than any other part of the"|FALSE
15707|"surface of the body, because their actions have been more frequently thus"|FALSE
15707|"associated. Thus in a surfeit from drinking cold water, when a person is"|FALSE
15707|"very hot and fatigued, an eruption is liable to appear on the face in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of this sympathy. In the same manner the rosy eruption on the"|FALSE
15707|"faces of drunkards more probably arises from the sympathy of the face with"|FALSE
15707|"the stomach, rather than between the face and the liver, as is generally"|FALSE
15707|"supposed."|FALSE
15707|"This sympathy between the stomach and the skin of the face is apparent in"|FALSE
15707|"the eruption of the small-pox; since, where the disease is in considerable"|FALSE
15707|"quantity, the eruption on the face first succeeds the sickness of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach. In the natural disease the stomach seems to be frequently"|FALSE
15707|"primarily affected, either alone or along with the tonsils, as the matter"|FALSE
15707|"seems to be only diffused in the air, and by being mixed with the saliva,"|FALSE
15707|"or mucus of the tonsils, to be swallowed into the stomach."|FALSE
15707|"After some days the irritative circles of motions become disordered by this"|FALSE
15707|"new stimulus, which acts upon the mucus lining of the stomach; and"|FALSE
15707|"sickness, vertigo, and a diurnal fever succeed. These disordered irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions become daily increased for two or three days, and then by their"|FALSE
15707|"increased action certain sensitive motions, or inflammation, is produced,"|FALSE
15707|"and at the next cold fit of fever, when the stomach recovers from its"|FALSE
15707|"torpor, an inflammation of the external skin is formed in points (which"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards suppurate), by sensitive association, in the same manner as a"|FALSE
15707|"cough is produced in consequence of exposing the feet to cold, as described"|FALSE
15707|"in Sect. XXV. 17. and Class IV. 2. I. 7. If the inoculated skin of the arm,"|FALSE
15707|"as far as it appears inflamed, was to be cut out, or destroyed by caustic,"|FALSE
15707|"before the fever commenced, as suppose on the fourth day after inoculation,"|FALSE
15707|"would this prevent the disease? as it is supposed to prevent the"|FALSE
15707|"hydrophobia."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Where the new vessels, and enlarged old ones, which constitute"|FALSE

15707|"repeated bleeding, cathartics, diluent potations, and warm bath."|FALSE
15707|"After the vessels are thus emptied, and the absorption of the new vessels"|FALSE
15707|"and deposited fluids is evidently begun, it is much promoted by stimulating"|FALSE
15707|"the part externally by solutions of lead, or other metals, and internally"|FALSE
15707|"by the bark, and small doses of opium. Hence when an ophthalmy begins to"|FALSE
15707|"become paler, any acrid eye-water, as a solution of six grains of white"|FALSE
15707|"vitriol in an ounce of water, hastens the absorption, and clears the eye in"|FALSE
15707|"a very short time. But the same application used a few days sooner would"|FALSE
15707|"have increased the inflammation. Hence after evacuation opium in small"|FALSE
15707|"doses may contribute to promote the absorption of fluids deposited on the"|FALSE
15707|"brain, as observed by Mr. Bromfield in his treatise of surgery."|FALSE
15707|"2. Where an abscess is formed by the rupture of these new vessels, the"|FALSE
15707|"violence of inflammation ceases, and a new gland separates a material"|FALSE
15707|"called pus: at the same time a less degree of inflammation produces new"|FALSE
15707|"vessels called vulgarly proud flesh; which, if no bandage confines its"|FALSE
15707|"growth, nor any other circumstance promotes absorption in the wound, would"|FALSE
15707|"rise to a great height above the usual size of the part."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the art of healing ulcers consists in producing a tendency to"|FALSE
15707|"absorption in the wound greater than the deposition. Thus when an"|FALSE
15707|"ill-conditioned ulcer separates a copious and thin discharge, by the use of"|FALSE
15707|"any stimulus, as of salts of lead, or mercury, or copper externally"|FALSE
15707|"applied, the discharge becomes diminished in quantity, and becomes thicker,"|FALSE
15707|"as the thinner parts are first absorbed."|FALSE
15707|"But nothing so much contributes to increase the absorption in a wound as"|FALSE
15707|"covering the whole limb above the sore with a bandage, which should be"|FALSE
15707|"spread with some plaster, as with emplastrum de minio, to prevent it from"|FALSE
15707|"slipping. By this artificial tightness of the skin, the arterial pulsations"|FALSE
15707|"act with double their usual power in promoting the ascending current of the"|FALSE
15707|"fluid in the valvular lymphatics."|FALSE
15707|"Internally the absorption from ulcers should be promoted first by"|FALSE
15707|"evacuation, then by opium, bark, mercury, steel."|FALSE
15707|"3. Where the inflammation proceeds with greater violence or rapidity, that"|FALSE
15707|"is, when by the painful sensation a more inordinate activity of the organ"|FALSE
15707|"is produced, and by this great activity an additional quantity of painful"|FALSE
15707|"sensation follows in an increasing ratio, till the whole of the sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, or spirit of animation, in the part becomes exhausted, a"|FALSE
15707|"mortification ensues, as in a carbuncle, in inflammations of the bowels, in"|FALSE
15707|"the extremities of old people, or in the limbs of those who are brought"|FALSE
15707|"near a fire after having been much benumbed with cold. And from hence it"|FALSE
15707|"appears, why weak people are more subject to mortification than strong"|FALSE
15707|"ones, and why in weak persons less pain will produce mortification, namely,"|FALSE
15707|"because the sensorial power is sooner exhausted by any excess of activity."|FALSE
15707|"I remember seeing a gentleman who had the preceding day travelled two"|FALSE
15707|"stages in a chaise with what he termed a bearable pain in his bowels; which"|FALSE
15707|"when I saw him had ceased rather suddenly, and without a passage through"|FALSE
15707|"him; his pulse was then weak, though not very quick; but as nothing which"|FALSE
15707|"he swallowed would continue in his stomach many minutes, I concluded that"|FALSE
15707|"the bowel was mortified; he died on the next day. It is usual for patients"|FALSE
15707|"sinking under the small-pox with mortified pustules, and with purple spots"|FALSE
15707|"intermixed, to complain of no pain, but to say they are pretty well to the"|FALSE
15707|"last moment."|FALSE

15707|"IV. When the motions of any part of the system, in consequence of previous"|FALSE
15707|"torpor, are performed with more energy than in the irritative fevers, a"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation is produced, and new actions of some part of the"|FALSE
15707|"system commence in consequence of this sensation conjointly with the"|FALSE
15707|"irritation: which motions constitute inflammation. If the fever be attended"|FALSE
15707|"with a strong pulse, as in pleurisy, or rheumatism, it is termed synocha"|FALSE
15707|"sensitiva, or sensitive fever with strong pulse; which is usually termed"|FALSE
15707|"inflammatory fever. If it be attended with weak pulse, it is termed typhus"|FALSE
15707|"sensitivus, or sensitive fever with weak pulse, or typhus gravior, or"|FALSE
15707|"putrid malignant fever."|FALSE
15707|"The synocha sensitiva, or sensitive fever with strong pulse, is generally"|FALSE
15707|"attended with some topical inflammation, as in peripneumony, hepatitis, and"|FALSE
15707|"is accompanied with much coagulable lymph, or size; which rises to the"|FALSE
15707|"surface of the blood, when taken into a bason, as it cools; and which is"|FALSE
15707|"believed to be the increased mucous secretion from the coats of the"|FALSE
15707|"arteries, inspissated by a greater absorption of its aqueous and saline"|FALSE
15707|"part, and perhaps changed by its delay in the circulation."|FALSE
15707|"The typhus sensitivus, or sensitive fever with weak pulse, is frequently"|FALSE
15707|"attended with delirium, which is caused by the deficiency of the quantity"|FALSE
15707|"of sensorial power, and with variety of cutaneous eruptions."|FALSE
15707|"Inflammation is caused by the pains occasioned by excess of action, and not"|FALSE
15707|"by those pains which are occasioned by defect of action. These morbid"|FALSE
15707|"actions, which are thus produced by two sensorial powers, viz. by"|FALSE
15707|"irritation and sensation, secrete new living fibres, which elongate the old"|FALSE
15707|"vessels, or form new ones, and at the same time much heat is evolved from"|FALSE
15707|"these combinations. By the rupture of these vessels, or by a new"|FALSE
15707|"construction of their apertures, purulent matters are secreted of various"|FALSE
15707|"kinds; which are infectious the first time they are applied to the skin"|FALSE
15707|"beneath the cuticle, or swallowed with the saliva into the stomach. This"|FALSE
15707|"contagion acts not by its being absorbed into the circulation, but by the"|FALSE
15707|"sympathies, or associated actions, between the part first stimulated by the"|FALSE
15707|"contagious matter and the other parts of the system. Thus in the natural"|FALSE
15707|"small-pox the contagion is swallowed with the saliva, and by its stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"inflames the stomach; this variolous inflammation of the stomach increases"|FALSE
15707|"every day, like the circle round the puncture of an inoculated arm, till it"|FALSE
15707|"becomes great enough to disorder the circles of irritative and sensitive"|FALSE
15707|"motions, and thus produces fever-fits, with sickness and vomiting. Lastly,"|FALSE
15707|"after the cold paroxysm, or fit of torpor, of the stomach has increased for"|FALSE
15707|"two or three successive days, an inflammation of the skin commences in"|FALSE
15707|"points; which generally first appear upon the face, as the associated"|FALSE
15707|"actions between the skin of the face and that of the stomach have been more"|FALSE
15707|"frequently exerted together than those of any other parts of the external"|FALSE
15707|"surface."|FALSE
15707|"Contagious matters, as those of the measles and small-pox, do not act upon"|FALSE
15707|"the system at the same time; but the progress of that which was last"|FALSE
15707|"received is delayed, till the action of the former infection ceases. All"|FALSE
15707|"kinds of matter, even that from common ulcers, are probably contagious the"|FALSE
15707|"first time they are inserted beneath the cuticle or swallowed into the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach; that is, as they were formed by certain morbid actions of the"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of the vessels, they have the power to excite similar morbid"|FALSE
15707|"actions in the extremities of other vessels, to which they are applied; and"|FALSE
15707|"these by sympathy, or associations of motion, excite similar morbid actions"|FALSE
15707|"in distant parts of the system, without entering the circulation; and hence"|FALSE
15707|"the blood of a patient in the small-pox will not give that disease by"|FALSE
15707|"inoculation to others."|FALSE
15707|"When the new fibres or vessels become again absorbed into the circulation,"|FALSE
15707|"the inflammation ceases; which is promoted, after sufficient evacuations,"|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. Before we commence this Section on Diseased Voluntary Motions, it may"|FALSE
15707|"be necessary to premise, that the word volition is not used in this work"|FALSE
15707|"exactly in its common acceptation. Volition is said in Section V. to bear"|FALSE
15707|"the same analogy to desire and aversion, which sensation does to pleasure"|FALSE
15707|"and pain. And hence that, when desire or aversion produces any action of"|FALSE
15707|"the muscular fibres, or of the organs of sense, they are termed volition;"|FALSE
15707|"and the actions produced in consequence are termed voluntary actions."|FALSE
15707|"Whence it appears, that motions of our muscles or ideas may be produced in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of desire or aversion without our having the power to prevent"|FALSE
15707|"them, and yet these motions may be termed voluntary, according to our"|FALSE
15707|"definition of the word; though in common language they would be called"|FALSE
15707|"involuntary."|FALSE
15707|"The objects of desire and aversion are generally at a distance, whereas"|FALSE
15707|"those of pleasure and pain are immediately acting upon our organs. Hence,"|FALSE
15707|"before desire or aversion are exerted, so as to cause any actions, there is"|FALSE
15707|"generally time for deliberation; which consists in discovering the means to"|FALSE
15707|"obtain the object of desire, or to avoid the object of aversion; or in"|FALSE
15707|"examining the good or bad consequences, which may result from them. In this"|FALSE
15707|"case it is evident, that we have a power to delay the proposed action, or"|FALSE
15707|"to perform it; and this power of choosing, whether we shall act or not, is"|FALSE
15707|"in common language expressed by the word volition, or will. Whereas in this"|FALSE
15707|"work the word volition means simply the active state of the sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"faculty in producing motion in consequence of desire or aversion: whether"|FALSE
15707|"we have the power of restraining that action, or not; that is, whether we"|FALSE
15707|"exert any actions in consequence of opposite desires or aversions, or not."|FALSE
15707|"For if the objects of desire or aversion are present, there is no necessity"|FALSE
15707|"to investigate or compare the _means_ of obtaining them, nor do we always"|FALSE
15707|"deliberate about their consequences; that is, no deliberation necessarily"|FALSE
15707|"intervenes, and in consequence the power of choosing to act or not is not"|FALSE
15707|"exerted. It is probable, that this twofold use of the word volition in all"|FALSE
15707|"languages has confounded the metaphysicians, who have disputed about free"|FALSE
15707|"will and necessity. Whereas from the above analysis it would appear, that"|FALSE
15707|"during our sleep, we use no voluntary exertions at all; and in our waking"|FALSE
15707|"hours, that they are the consequence of desire or aversion."|FALSE
15707|"To will is to act in consequence of desire; but to desire means to desire"|FALSE
15707|"something, even if that something be only to become free from the pain,"|FALSE
15707|"which causes the desire; for to desire nothing is not to desire; the word"|FALSE
15707|"desire, therefore, includes both the action and the object or motive; for"|FALSE
15707|"the object and motive of desire are the same thing. Hence to desire without"|FALSE
15707|"an object, that is, without a motive, is a solecism in language. As if one"|FALSE
15707|"should ask, if you could eat without food, or breathe without air."|FALSE
15707|"From this account of volition it appears, that convulsions of the muscles,"|FALSE
15707|"as in epileptic fits, may in the common sense of that word be termed"|FALSE
15707|"involuntary; because no deliberation is interposed between the desire or"|FALSE
15707|"aversion and the consequent action; but in the sense of the word, as above"|FALSE
15707|"defined, they belong to the class of voluntary motions, as delivered in"|FALSE
15707|"Vol. II. Class III. If this use of the word be discordant to the ear of the"|FALSE
15707|"reader, the term morbid voluntary motions, or motions in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"aversion, may be substituted in its stead."|FALSE
15707|"If a person has a desire to be cured of the ague, and has at the same time"|FALSE
15707|"an aversion (or contrary desire) to swallowing an ounce of Peruvian bark;"|FALSE
15707|"he balances desire against desire, or aversion against aversion; and thus"|FALSE
15707|"he acquires the power of choosing, which is the common acceptation of the"|FALSE
15707|"word _willing_. But in the cold fit of ague, after having discovered that"|FALSE
15707|"the act of shuddering, or exerting the subcutaneous muscles, relieves the"|FALSE
15707|"pain of cold; he immediately exerts this act of volition, and shudders, as"|FALSE
15707|"soon as the pain and consequent aversion return, without any deliberation"|FALSE
15707|"intervening; yet is this act, as well as that of swallowing an ounce of the"|FALSE
15707|"bark, caused by volition; and that even though he endeavours in vain to"|FALSE
15707|"prevent it by a weaker contrary volition. This recalls to our minds the"|FALSE
15707|"story of the hungry ass between two hay-stacks, where the two desires are"|FALSE
15707|"supposed so exactly to counteract each other, that he goes to neither of"|FALSE
15707|"the stacks, but perishes by want. Now as two equal and opposite desires are"|FALSE
15707|"thus supposed to balance each other, and prevent all action, it follows,"|FALSE
15707|"that if one of these hay-stacks was suddenly removed, that the ass would"|FALSE
15707|"irresistibly be hurried to the other, which in the common use of the word"|FALSE
15707|"might be called an involuntary act; but which, in our acceptation of it,"|FALSE
15707|"would be classed amongst voluntary actions, as above explained."|FALSE
15707|"Hence to deliberate is to compare opposing desires or aversions, and that"|FALSE
15707|"which is the most interesting at length prevails, and produces action."|FALSE
15707|"Similar to this, where two pains oppose each other, the stronger or more"|FALSE
15707|"interesting one produces action; as in pleurisy the pain from suffocation"|FALSE
15707|"would produce expansion of the lungs, but the pain occasioned by extending"|FALSE
15707|"the inflamed membrane, which lines the chest, opposes this expansion, and"|FALSE
15707|"one or the other alternately prevails."|FALSE
15707|"When any one moves his hand quickly near another person's eyes, the"|FALSE
15707|"eye-lids instantly close; this act in common language is termed"|FALSE
15707|"involuntary, as we have not time to deliberate or to exert any contrary"|FALSE
15707|"desire or aversion, but in this work it would be termed a voluntary act,"|FALSE
15707|"because it is caused by the faculty of volition, and after a few trials the"|FALSE
15707|"nictitation can be prevented by a contrary or opposing volition."|FALSE
15707|"The power of opposing volitions is best exemplified in the story of Mutius"|FALSE
15707|"Scævola, who is said to have thrust his hand into the fire before Porcenna,"|FALSE
15707|"and to have suffered it to be consumed for having failed him in his attempt"|FALSE
15707|"on the life of that general. Here the aversion for the loss of same, or the"|FALSE
15707|"unsatisfied desire to serve his country, the two prevalent enthusiasms at"|FALSE
15707|"that time, were more powerful than the desire of withdrawing his hand,"|FALSE
15707|"which must be occasioned by the pain of combustion; of these opposing"|FALSE
15707|"volitions"|FALSE
15707|"  Vincit amor patriæ, laudumque immensa cupido."|FALSE
15707|"If any one is told not to swallow his saliva for a minute, he soon swallows"|FALSE
15707|"it contrary to his will, in the common sense of that word; but this also is"|FALSE
15707|"a voluntary action, as it is performed by the faculty of volition, and is"|FALSE
15707|"thus to be understood. When the power of volition is exerted on any of our"|FALSE
15707|"senses, they become more acute, as in our attempts to hear small noises in"|FALSE
15707|"the night. As explained in Section XIX. 6. Hence by our attention to the"|FALSE
15707|"fauces from our desire not to swallow our saliva; the fauces become more"|FALSE
15707|"sensible; and the stimulus of the saliva is followed by greater sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"and consequent desire of swallowing it. So that the desire or volition in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of the increased sensation of the saliva is more powerful, than"|FALSE
15707|"the previous desire not to swallow it. See Vol. II. Deglutitio invita. In"|FALSE
15707|"the same manner if a modest man wishes not to want to make water, when he"|FALSE
15707|"is confined with ladies in a coach or an assembly-room; that very act of"|FALSE
15707|"volition induces the circumstance, which he wishes to avoid, as above"|FALSE
15707|"explained; insomuch that I once saw a partial insanity, which might be"|FALSE
15707|"called a voluntary diabetes, which was occasioned by the fear (and"|FALSE
15707|"consequent aversion) of not being able to make water at all."|FALSE
15707|"It is further necessary to observe here, to prevent any confusion of"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary, with sensitive, or associate motions, that in all the instances"|FALSE
15707|"of violent efforts to relieve pain, those efforts are at first voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"exertions; but after they have been frequently repeated for the purpose of"|FALSE
15707|"relieving certain pains, they become associated with those pains, and cease"|FALSE
15707|"at those times to be subservient to the will; as in coughing, sneezing, and"|FALSE
15707|"strangury. Of these motions those which contribute to remove or dislodge"|FALSE
15707|"the offending cause, as the actions of the abdominal muscles in parturition"|FALSE
15707|"or in vomiting, though they were originally excited by volition, are in"|FALSE
15707|"this work termed sensitive motions; but those actions of the muscles or"|FALSE
15707|"organs of sense, which do not contribute to remove the offending cause, as"|FALSE
15707|"in general convulsions or in madness, are in this work termed voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"motions, or motions in consequence of aversion, though in common language"|FALSE
15707|"they are called involuntary ones. Those sensitive unrestrainable actions,"|FALSE
15707|"which contribute to remove the cause of pain are uniformly and invariably"|FALSE
15707|"exerted, as in coughing or sneezing; but those motions which are exerted in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of aversion without contributing to remove the painful cause,"|FALSE
15707|"but only to prevent the sensation of it, as in epileptic, or cataleptic"|FALSE
15707|"fits, are not uniformly and invariably exerted, but change from one set of"|FALSE
15707|"muscles to another, as will be further explained; and may by this criterion"|FALSE
15707|"also be distinguished from the former."|FALSE
15707|"At the same time those motions, which are excited by perpetual stimulus, or"|FALSE
15707|"by association with each other, or immediately by pleasureable or painful"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, may properly be termed involuntary motions, as those of the"|FALSE
15707|"heart and arteries; as the faculty of volition seldom affects those, except"|FALSE
15707|"when it exists in unnatural quantity, as in maniacal people."|FALSE
15707|"2. It was observed in Section XIV. on the Production of Ideas, that those"|FALSE
15707|"parts of the system, which are usually termed the organs of sense, are"|FALSE
15707|"liable to be excited into pain by the excess of the stimulus of those"|FALSE
15707|"objects, which are by nature adapted to affect them; as of too great light,"|FALSE
15707|"sound, or pressure. But that these organs receive no pain from the defect"|FALSE
15707|"or absence of these stimuli, as in darkness or silence. But that our other"|FALSE
15707|"organs of perception, which have generally been called appetites, as of"|FALSE
15707|"hunger, thirst, want of heat, want of fresh air, are liable to be affected"|FALSE
15707|"with pain by the defect, as well as by the excess of their appropriated"|FALSE
15707|"stimuli."|FALSE
15707|"This excess or defect of stimulus is however to be considered only as the"|FALSE
15707|"remote cause of the pain, the immediate cause being the excess or defect of"|FALSE
15707|"the natural action of the affected part, according to Sect. IV. 5. Hence"|FALSE
15707|"all the pains of the body may be divided into those from excess of motion,"|FALSE
15707|"and those from defect of motion; which distinction is of great importance"|FALSE
15707|"in the knowledge and the cure of many diseases. For as the pains from"|FALSE
15707|"excess of motion either gradually subside, or are in general succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation; so those from defect of motion either gradually subside, or"|FALSE
15707|"are in general succeeded by convulsion, or madness. These pains are easily"|FALSE
15707|"distinguishable from each other by this circumstance, that the former are"|FALSE
15707|"attended with heat of the pained part, or of the whole body; whereas the"|FALSE
15707|"latter exists without increase of heat in the pained part, and is generally"|FALSE
15707|"attended with coldness of the extremities of the body; which is the true"|FALSE
15707|"criterion of what have been called nervous pains."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when any acrid material, as snuff or lime, falls into the eye, pain"|FALSE
15707|"and inflammation and heat are produced from the excess of stimulus; but"|FALSE
15707|"violent hunger, hemicrania, or the clavus hystericus, are attended with"|FALSE
15707|"coldness of the extremities, and defect of circulation. When we are exposed"|FALSE
15707|"to great cold, the pain we experience from the deficiency of heat is"|FALSE
15707|"attended with a quiescence of the motions of the vascular system; so that"|FALSE
15707|"no inflammation is produced, but a great desire of heat, and a tremulous"|FALSE
15707|"motion of the subcutaneous muscles, which is properly a convulsion in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of this pain from defect of the stimulus of heat."|FALSE
15707|"It was before mentioned, that as sensation consists in certain movements of"|FALSE
15707|"the sensorium, beginning at some of the extremities of it, and propagated"|FALSE
15707|"to the central parts of it; so volition consists of certain other movements"|FALSE
15707|"of the sensorium, commencing in the central parts of it, and propagated to"|FALSE
15707|"some of its extremities. This idea of these two great powers of motion in"|FALSE
15707|"the animal machine is confirmed from observing, that they never exist in a"|FALSE
15707|"great degree or universally at the same time; for while we strongly exert"|FALSE
15707|"our voluntary motions, we cease to feel the pains or uneasinesses, which"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned us to exert them."|FALSE
15707|"Hence during the time of fighting with fists or swords no pain is felt by"|FALSE
15707|"the combatants, till they cease to exert themselves. Thus in the beginning"|FALSE
15707|"of ague-fits the painful sensation of cold is diminished, while the patient"|FALSE
15707|"exerts himself in the shivering and gnashing of his teeth. He then ceases"|FALSE
15707|"to exert himself, and the pain of cold returns; and he is thus perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"induced to reiterate these exertions, from which he experiences a temporary"|FALSE
15707|"relief. The same occurs in labour-pains, the exertion of the parturient"|FALSE
15707|"woman relieves the violence of the pains for a time, which recur again soon"|FALSE
15707|"after she has ceased to use those exertions. The same is true in many other"|FALSE
15707|"painful diseases, as in the strangury, tenesmus, and the efforts of"|FALSE
15707|"vomiting; all these disagreeable sensations are diminished or removed for a"|FALSE
15707|"time by the various exertions they occasion, and recur alternately with"|FALSE
15707|"those exertions."|FALSE
15707|"The restlessness in some fevers is an almost perpetual exertion of this"|FALSE
15707|"kind, excited to relieve some disagreeable sensations; the reciprocal"|FALSE
15707|"opposite exertions of a wounded worm, the alternate emprosthotonos and"|FALSE
15707|"opisthotonos of some spasmodic diseases, and the intervals of all"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions, from whatever cause, seem to be owing to this circumstance of"|FALSE
15707|"the laws of animation; that great or universal exertion cannot exist at the"|FALSE
15707|"same time with great or universal sensation, though they can exist"|FALSE
15707|"reciprocally; which is probably resolvable into the more general law, that"|FALSE
15707|"the whole sensorial power being expended in one mode of exertion, there is"|FALSE
15707|"none to spare for any other. Whence syncope, or temporary apoplexy,"|FALSE
15707|"succeeds to epileptic convulsions."|FALSE
15707|"3. Hence when any violent pain afflicts us, of which we can neither avoid"|FALSE
15707|"nor remove the cause, we soon learn to endeavour to alleviate it, by"|FALSE
15707|"exerting some violent voluntary effort, as mentioned above; and are"|FALSE
15707|"naturally induced to use those muscles for this purpose, which have been in"|FALSE
15707|"the early periods of our lives most frequently or most powerfully exerted."|FALSE
15707|"Now the first muscles, which infants use most frequently, are those of"|FALSE
15707|"respiration; and on this account we gain a habit of holding our breath, at"|FALSE
15707|"the same time that we use great efforts to exclude it, for this purpose of"|FALSE
15707|"alleviating unavoidable pain; or we press out our breath through a small"|FALSE
15707|"aperture of the larynx, and scream violently, when the pain is greater than"|FALSE
15707|"is relievable by the former mode of exertion. Thus children scream to"|FALSE
15707|"relieve any pain either of body or mind, as from anger, or fear of being"|FALSE
15707|"beaten."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it is curious to observe, that those animals, who have more"|FALSE
15707|"frequently exerted their muscles of respiration violently, as in talking,"|FALSE
15707|"barking, or grunting, as children, dogs, hogs, scream much more, when they"|FALSE
15707|"are in pain, than those other animals, who use little or no language in"|FALSE
15707|"their common modes of life; as horses, sheep, and cows."|FALSE
15707|"The next most frequent or most powerful efforts, which infants are first"|FALSE
15707|"tempted to produce, are those with the muscles in biting hard substances;"|FALSE
15707|"indeed the exertion of these muscles is very powerful in common"|FALSE
15707|"mastication, as appears from the pain we receive, if a bit of bone is"|FALSE
15707|"unexpectedly found amongst our softer food; and further appears from their"|FALSE
15707|"acting to so great mechanical disadvantage, particularly when we bite with"|FALSE
15707|"the incisores, or canine teeth; which are first formed, and thence are"|FALSE
15707|"first used to violent exertion."|FALSE
15707|"Hence when a person is in great pain, the cause of which he cannot remove,"|FALSE
15707|"he sets his teeth firmly together, or bites some substance between them"|FALSE
15707|"with great vehemence, as another mode of violent exertion to produce a"|FALSE
15707|"temporary relief. Thus we have a proverb where no help can be had in pain,"|FALSE
15707|"\"to grin and abide;\" and the tortures of hell are said to be attended with"|FALSE
15707|"\"gnashing of teeth.\""|FALSE
15707|"Hence in violent spasmodic pains I have seen people bite not only their"|FALSE
15707|"tongues, but their arms or fingers, or those of the attendants, or any"|FALSE
15707|"object which was near them; and also strike, pinch, or tear, others or"|FALSE
15707|"themselves, particularly the part of their own body, which is painful at"|FALSE
15707|"the time. Soldiers, who die of painful wounds in battle, are said in Homer"|FALSE
15707|"to bite the ground. Thus also in the bellon, or colica saturnina, the"|FALSE
15707|"patients are said to bite their own flesh, and dogs in this disease to bite"|FALSE
15707|"up the ground they lie upon. It is probable that the great endeavours to"|FALSE
15707|"bite in mad dogs, and the violence of other mad animals, is owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"same cause."|FALSE
15707|"4. If the efforts of our voluntary motions are exerted with still greater"|FALSE
15707|"energy for the relief of some disagreeable sensation, convulsions are"|FALSE
15707|"produced; as the various kinds of epilepsy, and in some hysteric paroxysms."|FALSE
15707|"In all these diseases a pain, or disagreeable sensation is produced,"|FALSE
15707|"frequently by worms, or acidity in the bowels, or by a diseased nerve in"|FALSE
15707|"the side, or head, or by the pain of a diseased liver."|FALSE
15707|"In some constitutions a more intolerable degree of pain is produced in some"|FALSE
15707|"part at a distance from the cause by sensitive association, as before"|FALSE
15707|"explained; these pains in such constitutions arise to so great a degree,"|FALSE
15707|"that I verily believe no artificial tortures could equal some, which I have"|FALSE
15707|"witnessed; and am confident life would not have long been preserved, unless"|FALSE
15707|"they had been soon diminished or removed by the universal convulsion of the"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary motions, or by temporary madness."|FALSE
15707|"In some of the unfortunate patients I have observed, the pain has risen to"|FALSE
15707|"an inexpressible degree, as above described, before the convulsions have"|FALSE
15707|"supervened; and which were preceded by screaming, and grinning; in others,"|FALSE
15707|"as in the common epilepsy, the convulsion has immediately succeeded the"|FALSE
15707|"commencement of the disagreeable sensations; and as a stupor frequently"|FALSE
15707|"succeeds the convulsions, they only seemed to remember that a pain at the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach preceded the fit, or some other uneasy feel; or more frequently"|FALSE
15707|"retained no memory at all of the immediate cause of the paroxysm. But even"|FALSE
15707|"in this kind of epilepsy, where the patient does not recollect any"|FALSE
15707|"preceding pain, the paroxysms generally are preceded by a quivering motion"|FALSE
15707|"of the under jaw, with a biting of the tongue; the teeth afterwards become"|FALSE
15707|"pressed together with vehemence, and the eyes are then convulsed, before"|FALSE
15707|"the commencement of the universal convulsion; which are all efforts to"|FALSE
15707|"relieve pain."|FALSE
15707|"The reason why these convulsive motions are alternately exerted and"|FALSE
15707|"remitted was mentioned above, and in Sect. XII. 1. 3. when the exertions"|FALSE
15707|"are such as give a temporary relief to the pain, which excites them, they"|FALSE
15707|"cease for a time, till the pain is again perceived; and then new exertions"|FALSE
15707|"are produced for its relief. We see daily examples of this in the loud"|FALSE
15707|"reiterated laughter of some people; the pleasureable sensation, which"|FALSE
15707|"excites this laughter, arises for a time so high as to change its name and"|FALSE
15707|"become painful: the convulsive motions of the respiratory muscles relieve"|FALSE
15707|"the pain for a time; we are, however, unwilling to lose the pleasure, and"|FALSE
15707|"presently put a stop to this exertion, and immediately the pleasure recurs,"|FALSE
15707|"and again as instantly rises into pain. All of us have felt the pain of"|FALSE
15707|"immoderate laughter; children have been tickled into convulsions of the"|FALSE
15707|"whole body; and others have died in the act of laughing; probably from a"|FALSE
15707|"paralysis succeeding the long continued actions of the muscles of"|FALSE
15707|"respiration."|FALSE
15707|"Hence we learn the reason, why children, who are so easily excited to laugh"|FALSE
15707|"by the tickling of other people's fingers, cannot tickle themselves into"|FALSE
15707|"laughter. The exertion of their hands in the endeavour to tickle themselves"|FALSE
15707|"prevents the necessity of any exertion of the respiratory muscles to"|FALSE
15707|"relieve the excess of pleasurable affection. See Sect. XVII. 3. 5."|FALSE
15707|"Chrysippus is recorded to have died laughing, when an ass was invited to"|FALSE
15707|"sup with him. The same is related of one of the popes, who, when he was"|FALSE
15707|"ill, saw a tame monkey at his bedside put on the holy thiara. Hall. Phys."|FALSE
15707|"T. III. p. 306."|FALSE
15707|"There are instances of epilepsy being produced by laughing recorded by Van"|FALSE
15707|"Swieten, T. III. 402 and 308. And it is well known, that many people have"|FALSE
15707|"died instantaneously from the painful excess of joy, which probably might"|FALSE
15707|"have been prevented by the exertions of laughter."|FALSE
15707|"Every combination of ideas, which we attend to, occasions pain or pleasure;"|FALSE
15707|"those which occasion pleasure, furnish either social or selfish pleasure,"|FALSE
15707|"either malicious or friendly, or lascivious, or sublime pleasure; that is,"|FALSE
15707|"they give us pleasure mixed with other emotions, or they give us unmixed"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure, without occasioning any other emotions or exertions at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time. This unmixed pleasure, if it be great, becomes painful, like all"|FALSE
15707|"other animal motions from stimuli of every kind; and if no other exertions"|FALSE
15707|"are occasioned at the same time, we use the exertion of laughter to relieve"|FALSE
15707|"this pain. Hence laughter is occasioned by such wit as excites simple"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure without any other emotion, such as pity, love, reverence. For"|FALSE
15707|"sublime ideas are mixed with admiration, beautiful ones with love, new ones"|FALSE
15707|"with surprise; and these exertions of our ideas prevent the action of"|FALSE
15707|"laughter from being necessary to relieve the painful pleasure above"|FALSE
15707|"described. Whence laughable wit consists of frivolous ideas, without"|FALSE
15707|"connections of any consequence, such as puns on words, or on phrases,"|FALSE
15707|"incongruous junctions of ideas; on which account laughter is so frequent in"|FALSE
15707|"children."|FALSE
15707|"Unmixed pleasure less than that, which causes laughter, causes sleep, as in"|FALSE
15707|"singing children to sleep, or in slight intoxication from wine or food. See"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XVIII. 12."|FALSE
15707|"5. If the pains, or disagreeable sensations, above described do not obtain"|FALSE
15707|"a temporary relief from these convulsive exertions of the muscles, those"|FALSE
15707|"convulsive exertions continue without remission, and one kind of catalepsy"|FALSE
15707|"is produced. Thus when a nerve or tendon produces great pain by its being"|FALSE
15707|"inflamed or wounded, the patient sets his teeth firmly together, and grins"|FALSE
15707|"violently, to diminish the pain; and if the pain is not relieved by this"|FALSE
15707|"exertion, no relaxation of the maxillary muscles takes place, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions above described, but the jaws remain firmly fixed together."|FALSE
15707|"This locked jaw is the most frequent instance of cataleptic spasm, because"|FALSE
15707|"we are more inclined to exert the muscles subservient to mastication from"|FALSE
15707|"their early obedience to violent efforts of volition."|FALSE
15707|"But in the case related in Sect. XIX. on Reverie, the cataleptic lady had"|FALSE
15707|"pain in her upper teeth; and pressing one of her hands vehemently against"|FALSE
15707|"her cheek-bone to diminish this pain, it remained in that attitude for"|FALSE
15707|"about half an hour twice a day, till the painful paroxysm was over."|FALSE
15707|"I have this very day seen a young lady in this disease, (with which she has"|FALSE
15707|"frequently been afflicted,) she began to-day with violent pain shooting"|FALSE
15707|"from one side of the forehead to the occiput, and after various struggles"|FALSE
15707|"lay on the bed with her fingers and wrists bent and stiff for about two"|FALSE
15707|"hours; in other respects she seemed in a syncope with a natural pulse. She"|FALSE
15707|"then had intervals of pain and of spasm, and took three grains of opium"|FALSE
15707|"every hour till she had taken nine grains, before the pains and spasm"|FALSE
15707|"ceased."|FALSE
15707|"There is, however, another species of fixed spasm, which differs from the"|FALSE
15707|"former, as the pain exists in the contracted muscle, and would seem rather"|FALSE
15707|"to be the consequence than the cause of the contraction, as in the cramp in"|FALSE
15707|"the calf of the leg, and in many other parts of the body."|FALSE
15707|"In these spasms it should seem, that the muscle itself is first thrown into"|FALSE
15707|"contraction by some disagreeable sensation, as of cold; and that then the"|FALSE
15707|"violent pain is produced by the great contraction of the muscular fibres"|FALSE
15707|"extending its own tendons, which are said to be sensible to extension only;"|FALSE
15707|"and is further explained in Sect. XVIII. 15."|FALSE
15707|"6. Many instances have been given in this work, where after violent motions"|FALSE
15707|"excited by irritation, the organ has become quiescent to less, and even to"|FALSE
15707|"the great irritation, which induced it into violent motion; as after"|FALSE
15707|"looking long at the sun or any bright colour, they cease to be seen; and"|FALSE
15707|"after removing from bright day-light into a gloomy room, the eye cannot at"|FALSE
15707|"first perceive the objects, which stimulate it less. Similar to this is the"|FALSE
15707|"syncope, which succeeds after the violent exertions of our voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"motions, as after epileptic fits, for the power of volition acts in this"|FALSE
15707|"case as the stimulus in the other. This syncope is a temporary palsy, or"|FALSE
15707|"apoplexy, which ceases after a time, the muscles recovering their power of"|FALSE
15707|"being excited into action by the efforts of volition; as the eye in the"|FALSE
15707|"circumstance above mentioned recovers in a little time its power of seeing"|FALSE
15707|"objects in a gloomy room; which were invisible immediately after coming out"|FALSE
15707|"of a stronger light. This is owing to an accumulation of sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"during the inaction of those fibres, which were before accustomed to"|FALSE
15707|"perpetual exertions, as explained in Sect. XII. 7. 1. A slighter degree of"|FALSE
15707|"this disease is experienced by every one after great fatigue, when the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles gain such inability to further action, that we are obliged to rest"|FALSE
15707|"them for a while, or to summon a greater power of volition to continue"|FALSE
15707|"their motions."|FALSE
15707|"In all the syncopes, which I have seen induced after convulsive fits, the"|FALSE
15707|"pulse has continued natural, though the organs of sense, as well as the"|FALSE
15707|"locomotive muscles, have ceased to perform their functions; for it is"|FALSE
15707|"necessary for the perception of objects, that the external organs of sense"|FALSE
15707|"should be properly excited by the voluntary power, as the eye-lids must be"|FALSE
15707|"open, and perhaps the muscles of the eye put into action to distend, and"|FALSE
15707|"thence give greater pellucidity to the cornea, which in syncope, as in"|FALSE
15707|"death, appears flat and less transparent."|FALSE
15707|"The tympanum of the ear also seems to require a voluntary exertion of its"|FALSE
15707|"muscles, to gain its due tension, and it is probable the other external"|FALSE
15707|"organs of sense require a similar voluntary exertion to adapt them to the"|FALSE
15707|"distinct perception of objects. Hence in syncope as in sleep, as the power"|FALSE
15707|"of volition is suspended, no external objects are perceived. See Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XVIII. 5. During the time which the patient lies in a fainting fit, the"|FALSE
15707|"spirit of animation becomes accumulated; and hence the muscles in a while"|FALSE
15707|"become irritable by their usual stimulation, and the fainting fit ceases."|FALSE
15707|"See Sect. XII. 7. 1."|FALSE
15707|"7. If the exertion of the voluntary motions has been still more energetic,"|FALSE
15707|"the quiescence, which succeeds, is so complete, that they cannot again be"|FALSE
15707|"excited into action by the efforts of the will. In this manner the palsy,"|FALSE
15707|"and apoplexy (which is an universal palsy) are frequently produced after"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions, or other violent exertions; of this I shall add a few"|FALSE
15707|"instances."|FALSE
15707|"Platernus mentions some, who have died apoplectic from violent exertions in"|FALSE
15707|"dancing; and Dr. Mead, in his Essay on Poisons, records a patient in the"|FALSE
15707|"hydrophobia, who at one effort broke the cords which bound him, and at the"|FALSE
15707|"same instant expired. And it is probable, that those, who have expired from"|FALSE
15707|"immoderate laughter, have died from this paralysis consequent to violent"|FALSE
15707|"exertion. Mrs. Scott of Stafford was walking in her garden in perfect"|FALSE
15707|"health with her neighbour Mrs. ----; the latter accidentally fell into a"|FALSE
15707|"muddy rivulet, and tried in vain to disengage herself by the assistance of"|FALSE
15707|"Mrs. Scott's hand. Mrs. Scott exerted her utmost power for many minutes,"|FALSE
15707|"first to assist her friend, and next to prevent herself from being pulled"|FALSE
15707|"into the morass, as her distressed companion would not disengage her hand."|FALSE
15707|"After other assistance was procured by their united screams, Mrs. Scott"|FALSE
15707|"walked to a chair about twenty yards from the brook, and was seized with an"|FALSE
15707|"apoplectic stroke: which continued many days, and terminated in a total"|FALSE
15707|"loss of her right arm, and her speech; neither of which she ever after"|FALSE
15707|"perfectly recovered."|FALSE
15707|"It is said, that many people in Holland have died after skating too long or"|FALSE
15707|"too violently on their frozen canals; it is probable the death of these,"|FALSE
15707|"and of others, who have died suddenly in swimming, has been owing to this"|FALSE
15707|"great quiescence or paralysis; which has succeeded very violent exertions,"|FALSE
15707|"added to the concomitant cold, which has had greater effect after the"|FALSE
15707|"sufferers had been heated and exhausted by previous exercise."|FALSE
15707|"I remember a young man of the name of Nairne at Cambridge, who walking on"|FALSE
15707|"the edge of a barge fell into the river. His cousin and fellow-student of"|FALSE
15707|"the same name, knowing the other could not swim, plunged into the water"|FALSE
15707|"after him, caught him by his clothes, and approaching the bank by a"|FALSE
15707|"vehement exertion propelled him safe to the land, but that instant, seized,"|FALSE
15707|"as was supposed, by the cramp, or paralysis, sunk to rise no more. The"|FALSE
15707|"reason why the cramp of the muscles, which compose the calf of the leg, is"|FALSE
15707|"so liable to affect swimmers, is, because these muscles have very weak"|FALSE
15707|"antagonists, and are in walking generally elongated again after their"|FALSE
15707|"contraction by the weight of the body on the ball of the toe, which is very"|FALSE
15707|"much greater than the resistance of the water in swimming. See Section"|FALSE
15707|"XVIII. 15."|FALSE
15707|"It does not follow that every apoplectic or paralytic attack is immediately"|FALSE
15707|"preceded by vehement exertion; the quiescence, which succeeds exertion, and"|FALSE
15707|"which is not so great as to be termed paralysis, frequently recurs"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards at certain periods; and by other causes of quiescence, occurring"|FALSE
15707|"with those periods, as was explained in treating of the paroxysms of"|FALSE
15707|"intermitting fevers; the quiescence at length, becomes so great as to be"|FALSE
15707|"incapable of again being removed by the efforts of volition, and complete"|FALSE
15707|"paralysis is formed. See Section XXXII. 3. 2."|FALSE
15707|"Many of the paralytic patients, whom I have seen, have evidently had"|FALSE
15707|"diseased livers from the too frequent potation of spirituous liquors; some"|FALSE
15707|"of them have had the gutta rosea on their faces and breasts; which has in"|FALSE
15707|"some degree receded either spontaneously, or by the use of external"|FALSE
15707|"remedies, and the paralytic stroke has succeeded; and as in several"|FALSE
15707|"persons, who have drank much vinous spirits, I have observed epileptic fits"|FALSE
15707|"to commence at about forty or fifty years of age, without any hereditary"|FALSE
15707|"taint, from the stimulus, as I believed, of a diseased liver; I was induced"|FALSE
15707|"to ascribe many paralytic cases to the same source; which were not"|FALSE
15707|"evidently the effect of age, or of unacquired debility. And the account"|FALSE
15707|"given before of dropsies, which very frequently are owing to a paralysis of"|FALSE
15707|"the absorbent system, and are generally attendant on free drinkers of"|FALSE
15707|"spirituous liquors, confirmed me in this opinion."|FALSE
15707|"The disagreeable irritation of a diseased liver produces exertions and"|FALSE
15707|"consequent quiescence; these by the accidental concurrence of other causes"|FALSE
15707|"of quiescence, as cold, solar or lunar periods, inanition, the want of"|FALSE
15707|"their usual portion of spirit of wine, at length produces paralysis."|FALSE
15707|"This is further confirmed by observing, that the muscles, we most"|FALSE
15707|"frequently, or most powerfully exert, are most liable to palsy; as those of"|FALSE
15707|"the voice and of articulation, and of those paralytics which I have seen, a"|FALSE
15707|"much greater proportion have lost the use of their right arm; which is so"|FALSE
15707|"much more generally exerted than the left."|FALSE
15707|"I cannot dismiss this subject without observing, that after a paralytic"|FALSE
15707|"stroke, if the vital powers are not much injured, that the patient has all"|FALSE
15707|"the movements of the affected limb to learn over again, just as in early"|FALSE
15707|"infancy; the limb is first moved by the irritation of its muscles, as in"|FALSE
15707|"stretching, (of which a case was related in Section VII. 1. 3.) or by the"|FALSE
15707|"electric concussion; afterwards it becomes obedient to sensation, as in"|FALSE
15707|"violent danger or fear; and lastly, the muscles become again associated"|FALSE
15707|"with volition, and gradually acquire their usual habits of acting together."|FALSE
15707|"Another phænomenon in palsies is, that when the limbs of one side are"|FALSE
15707|"disabled, those of the other are in perpetual motion. This can only be"|FALSE
15707|"explained from conceiving that the power of motion, whatever it is, or"|FALSE
15707|"wherever it resides, and which is capable of being exhausted by fatigue,"|FALSE
15707|"and accumulated in rest, is now less expended, whilst one half of the body"|FALSE
15707|"is capable of receiving its usual proportion of it, and is hence derived"|FALSE
15707|"with greater ease or in greater abundance into the limbs, which remain"|FALSE
15707|"unaffected."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The excess or defect of voluntary exertion produces similar effects"|FALSE
15707|"upon the sensual motions, or ideas of the mind, as those already mentioned"|FALSE
15707|"upon the muscular fibres. Thus when any violent pain, arising from the"|FALSE
15707|"defect of some peculiar stimulus, exists either in the muscular or sensual"|FALSE
15707|"systems of fibres, and which cannot be removed by acquiring the defective"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus; as in some constitutions convulsions of the muscles are produced"|FALSE
15707|"to procure a temporary relief, so in other constitutions vehement voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"exertions of the ideas of the mind are produced for the same purpose; for"|FALSE
15707|"during this exertion, like that of the muscles, the pain either vanishes or"|FALSE
15707|"is diminished: this violent exertion constitutes madness; and in many cases"|FALSE
15707|"I have seen the madness take place, and the convulsions cease, and"|FALSE
15707|"reciprocally the madness cease, and the convulsions supervene. See Section"|FALSE
15707|"III. 5. 8."|FALSE
15707|"2. Madness is distinguishable from delirium, as in the latter the patient"|FALSE
15707|"knows not the place where he resides, nor the persons of his friends or"|FALSE
15707|"attendants, nor is conscious of any external objects, except when spoken to"|FALSE
15707|"with a louder voice, or stimulated with unusual force, and even then he"|FALSE
15707|"soon relapses into a state of inattention to every thing about him. Whilst"|FALSE
15707|"in the former he is perfectly sensible to every thing external, but has the"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary powers of his mind intensely exerted on some particular object of"|FALSE
15707|"his desire or aversion, he harbours in his thoughts a suspicion of all"|FALSE
15707|"mankind, lest they should counteract his designs; and while he keeps his"|FALSE
15707|"intentions, and the motives of his actions profoundly secret; he is"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually studying the means of acquiring the object of his wish, or of"|FALSE
15707|"preventing or revenging the injuries he suspects."|FALSE
15707|"3. A late French philosopher, Mr. Helvetius, has deduced almost all our"|FALSE
15707|"actions from this principle of their relieving us from the ennui or tædium"|FALSE
15707|"vitæ; and true it is, that our desires or aversions are the motives of all"|FALSE
15707|"our voluntary actions; and human nature seems to excel other animals in the"|FALSE
15707|"more facil use of this voluntary power, and on that account is more liable"|FALSE
15707|"to insanity than other animals. But in mania this violent exertion of"|FALSE
15707|"volition is expended on mistaken objects, and would not be relieved, though"|FALSE
15707|"we were to gain or escape the objects, that excite it. Thus I have seen two"|FALSE
15707|"instances of madmen, who conceived that they had the itch, and several have"|FALSE
15707|"believed they had the venereal infection, without in reality having a"|FALSE
15707|"symptom of either of them. They have been perpetually thinking upon this"|FALSE
15707|"subject, and some of them were in vain salivated with design of convincing"|FALSE
15707|"them to the contrary."|FALSE
15707|"4. In the minds of mad people those volitions alone exist, which are"|FALSE
15707|"unmixed with sensation; immoderate suspicion is generally the first"|FALSE
15707|"symptom, and want of shame, and want of delicacy about cleanliness."|FALSE
15707|"Suspicion is a voluntary exertion of the mind arising from the pain of"|FALSE
15707|"fear, which it is exerted to relieve: shame is the name of a peculiar"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation, see Fable of the Bees, and delicacy about"|FALSE
15707|"cleanliness arises from another disagreeable sensation. And therefore are"|FALSE
15707|"not found in the minds of maniacs, which are employed solely in voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"exertions. Hence the most modest women in this disease walk naked amongst"|FALSE
15707|"men without any kind of concern, use obscene discourse, and have no"|FALSE
15707|"delicacy about their natural evacuations."|FALSE
15707|"5. Nor are maniacal people more attentive to their natural appetites, or to"|FALSE
15707|"the irritations which surround them, except as far as may respect their"|FALSE
15707|"suspicions or designs; for the violent and perpetual exertions of their"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary powers of mind prevents their perception of almost every other"|FALSE
15707|"object, either of irritation or of sensation. Hence it is that they bear"|FALSE
15707|"cold, hunger, and fatigue, with much greater pertinacity than in their"|FALSE
15707|"sober hours, and are less injured by them in respect to their general"|FALSE
15707|"health. Thus it is asserted by historians, that Charles the Twelfth of"|FALSE
15707|"Sweden slept on the snow, wrapped only in his cloak, at the siege of"|FALSE
15707|"Frederickstad, and bore extremes of cold and hunger, and fatigue, under"|FALSE
15707|"which numbers of his soldiers perished; because the king was insane with"|FALSE
15707|"ambition, but the soldier had no such powerful stimulus to preserve his"|FALSE
15707|"system from debility and death."|FALSE
15707|"6. Besides the insanities arising from exertions in consequence of pain,"|FALSE
15707|"there is also a pleasurable insanity, as well as a pleasurable delirium; as"|FALSE
15707|"the insanity of personal vanity, and that of religious fanaticism. When"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable ideas excite into motion the sensorial power of sensation, and"|FALSE
15707|"this again causes other trains of agreeable ideas, a constant stream of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable ideas succeeds, and produces pleasurable delirium. So when the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power of volition excites agreeable ideas, and the pleasure thus"|FALSE
15707|"produced excites more volition in its turn, a constant flow of agreeable"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary ideas succeeds; which when thus exerted in the extreme"|FALSE
15707|"constitutes insanity."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when our muscular actions are excited by our sensations of pleasure,"|FALSE
15707|"it is termed play; when they are excited by our volition, it is termed"|FALSE
15707|"work; and the former of these is attended with less fatigue, because the"|FALSE
15707|"muscular actions in play produce in their turn more pleasurable sensation;"|FALSE
15707|"which again has the property of producing more muscular action. An"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable instance of this I saw this morning. A little boy, who was tired"|FALSE
15707|"with walking, begged of his papa to carry him. \"Here,\" says the reverend"|FALSE
15707|"doctor, \"ride upon my gold-headed cane;\" and the pleased child, putting it"|FALSE
15707|"between his legs, gallopped away with delight, and complained no more of"|FALSE
15707|"his fatigue. Here the aid of another sensorial power, that of pleasurable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation, superadded vigour to the exertion of exhausted volition. Which"|FALSE
15707|"could otherwise only have been excited by additional pain, as by the lash"|FALSE
15707|"of slavery. On this account where the whole sensorial power has been"|FALSE
15707|"exerted on the contemplation of the promised joys of heaven, the saints of"|FALSE
15707|"all persecuted religions have borne the tortures of martyrdom with"|FALSE
15707|"otherwise unaccountable firmness."|FALSE
15707|"7. There are some diseases, which obtain at least a temporary relief from"|FALSE
15707|"the exertions of insanity; many instances of dropsies being thus for a time"|FALSE
15707|"cured are recorded. An elderly woman labouring with ascites I twice saw"|FALSE
15707|"relieved for some weeks by insanity, the dropsy ceased for several weeks,"|FALSE
15707|"and recurred again alternating with the insanity. A man afflicted with"|FALSE
15707|"difficult respiration on lying down, with very irregular pulse, and"|FALSE
15707|"oedematous legs, whom I saw this day, has for above a week been much"|FALSE
15707|"relieved in respect to all those symptoms by the accession of insanity,"|FALSE
15707|"which is shewn by inordinate suspicion, and great anger."|FALSE
15707|"In cases of common temporary anger the increased action of the arterial"|FALSE
15707|"system is seen by the red skin, and increased pulse, with the immediate"|FALSE
15707|"increase of muscular activity. A friend of mine, when he was painfully"|FALSE
15707|"fatigued by riding on horseback, was accustomed to call up ideas into his"|FALSE
15707|"mind, which used to excite his anger or indignation, and thus for a time at"|FALSE
15707|"least relieved the pain of fatigue. By this temporary insanity, the effect"|FALSE
15707|"of the voluntary power upon the whole of his system was increased; as in"|FALSE
15707|"the cases of dropsy above mentioned, it would appear, that the increased"|FALSE
15707|"action of the voluntary faculty of the sensorium affected the absorbent"|FALSE
15707|"system, as well as the secerning one."|FALSE
15707|"8. In respect to relieving inflammatory pains, and removing fever, I have"|FALSE
15707|"seen many instances, as mentioned in Sect. XII. 2. 4. One lady, whom I"|FALSE
15707|"attended, had twice at some years interval a locked jaw, which relieved a"|FALSE
15707|"pain on her sternum with peripneumony. Two other ladies I saw, who towards"|FALSE
15707|"the end of violent peripneumony, in which they frequently lost blood, were"|FALSE
15707|"at length cured by insanity supervening. In the former the increased"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary exertion of the muscles of the jaw, in the latter that of the"|FALSE
15707|"organs of sense, removed the disease; that is, the disagreeable sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"which had produced the inflammation, now excited the voluntary power, and"|FALSE
15707|"these new voluntary exertions employed or expended the superabundant"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power, which had previously been exerted on the arterial system,"|FALSE
15707|"and caused inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"Another case, which I think worth relating, was of a young man about"|FALSE
15707|"twenty; he had laboured under an irritative fever with debility for three"|FALSE
15707|"or four weeks, with very quick and very feeble pulse, and other usual"|FALSE
15707|"symptoms of that species of typhus, but at this time complained much and"|FALSE
15707|"frequently of pain of his legs and feet. When those who attended him were"|FALSE
15707|"nearly in despair of his recovery, I observed with pleasure an insanity of"|FALSE
15707|"mind supervene: which was totally different from delirium, as he knew his"|FALSE
15707|"friends, calling them by their names, and the room in which he lay, but"|FALSE
15707|"became violently suspicious of his attendants, and calumniated with"|FALSE
15707|"vehement oaths his tender mother, who sat weeping by his bed. On this his"|FALSE
15707|"pulse became slower and firmer, but the quickness did not for some time"|FALSE
15707|"intirely cease, and he gradually recovered. In this case the introduction"|FALSE
15707|"of an increased quantity of the power of volition gave vigour to those"|FALSE
15707|"movements of the system, which are generally only actuated by the power of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, and of association."|FALSE
15707|"Another case I recollect of a young man, about twenty-five, who had the"|FALSE
15707|"scarlet-fever, with very quick pulse, and an universal eruption on his"|FALSE
15707|"skin, and was not without reason esteemed to be in great danger of his"|FALSE
15707|"life. After a few days an insanity supervened, which his friends mistook"|FALSE
15707|"for delirium, and he gradually recovered, and the cuticle peeled off. From"|FALSE
15707|"these and a few other cases I have always esteemed insanity to be a"|FALSE
15707|"favourable sign in fevers, and have cautiously distinguished it from"|FALSE
15707|"delirium."|FALSE
15707|"III. Another mode of mental exertion to relieve pain, is by producing a"|FALSE
15707|"train of ideas not only by the efforts of volition, as in insanity; but by"|FALSE
15707|"those of sensation likewise, as in delirium and sleep. This mental effort"|FALSE
15707|"is termed reverie, or somnambulation, and is described more at large in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XIX. on that subject. But I shall here relate another case of that"|FALSE
15707|"wonderful disease, which fell yesterday under my eye, and to which I have"|FALSE
15707|"seen many analogous alienations of mind, though not exactly similar in all"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances. But as all of them either began or terminated with pain or"|FALSE
15707|"convulsion, there can be no doubt but that they are of epileptic origin,"|FALSE
15707|"and constitute another mode of mental exertion to relieve some painful"|FALSE
15707|"sensation."|FALSE
15707|"1. Master A. about nine years old, had been seized at seven every morning"|FALSE
15707|"for ten days with uncommon fits, and had had slight returns in the"|FALSE
15707|"afternoon. They were supposed to originate from worms, and had been in vain"|FALSE
15707|"attempted to be removed by vermifuge purges. As his fit was expected at"|FALSE
15707|"seven yesterday morning, I saw him before that hour; he was asleep, seemed"|FALSE
15707|"free from pain, and his pulse natural. About seven he began to complain of"|FALSE
15707|"pain about his navel, or more to the left side, and in a few minutes had"|FALSE
15707|"exertions of his arms and legs like swimming. He then for half an hour"|FALSE
15707|"hunted a pack of hounds; as appeared by his hallooing, and calling the dogs"|FALSE
15707|"by their names, and discoursing with the attendants of the chase,"|FALSE
15707|"describing exactly a day of hunting, which (I was informed) he had"|FALSE
15707|"witnessed a year before, going through all the most minute circumstances of"|FALSE
15707|"it; calling to people, who were then present, and lamenting the absence of"|FALSE
15707|"others, who were then also absent. After this scene he imitated, as he lay"|FALSE
15707|"in bed, some of the plays of boys, as swimming and jumping. He then sung an"|FALSE
15707|"English and then an Italian song; part of which with his eyes open, and"|FALSE
15707|"part with them closed, but could not be awakened or excited by any"|FALSE
15707|"violence, which it was proper to use."|FALSE
15707|"After about an hour he came suddenly to himself with apparent surprise, and"|FALSE
15707|"seemed quite ignorant of any part of what had passed, and after being"|FALSE
15707|"apparently well for half an hour, he suddenly fell into a great stupor,"|FALSE
15707|"with slower pulse than natural, and a slow moaning respiration, in which he"|FALSE
15707|"continued about another half hour, and then recovered."|FALSE
15707|"The sequel of this disease was favourable; he was directed one grain of"|FALSE
15707|"opium at six every morning, and then to rise out of bed; at half past six"|FALSE
15707|"he was directed fifteen drops of laudanum in a glass of wine and water. The"|FALSE
15707|"first day the paroxysm became shorter, and less violent. The dose of opium"|FALSE
15707|"was increased to one-half more, and in three or four days the fits left"|FALSE
15707|"him. The bark and filings of iron were also exhibited twice a day; and I"|FALSE
15707|"believe the complaint returned no more."|FALSE
15707|"2. In this paroxysm it must be observed, that he began with pain, and ended"|FALSE
15707|"with stupor, in both circumstances resembling a fit of epilepsy. And that"|FALSE
15707|"therefore the exertions both of mind and body, both the voluntary ones, and"|FALSE
15707|"those immediately excited by pleasurable sensation, were exertions to"|FALSE
15707|"relieve pain."|FALSE
15707|"The hunting scene appeared to be rather an act of memory than of"|FALSE
15707|"imagination, and was therefore rather a voluntary exertion, though attended"|FALSE
15707|"with the pleasurable eagerness, which was the consequence of those ideas"|FALSE
15707|"recalled by recollection, and not the cause of them."|FALSE
15707|"These ideas thus voluntarily recollected were succeeded by sensations of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure, though his senses were unaffected by the stimuli of visible or"|FALSE
15707|"audible objects; or so weakly excited by them as not to produce sensation"|FALSE
15707|"or attention. And the pleasure thus excited by volition produced other"|FALSE
15707|"ideas and other motions in consequence of the sensorial power of sensation."|FALSE
15707|"Whence the mixed catenations of voluntary and sensitive ideas and muscular"|FALSE
15707|"motions in reverie; which, like every other kind of vehement exertion,"|FALSE
15707|"contribute to relieve pain, by expending a large quantity of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power."|FALSE
15707|"Those fits generally commence during sleep, from whence I suppose they have"|FALSE
15707|"been thought to have some connection with sleep, and have thence been"|FALSE
15707|"termed Somnambulism; but their commencement during sleep is owing to our"|FALSE
15707|"increased excitability by internal sensations at that time, as explained in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XVIII. 14. and 15., and not to any similitude between reverie and"|FALSE
15707|"sleep."|FALSE
15707|"3. I was once concerned for a very elegant and ingenious young lady, who"|FALSE
15707|"had a reverie on alternate days, which continued nearly the whole day; and"|FALSE
15707|"as in her days of disease she took up the same kind of ideas, which she had"|FALSE
15707|"conversed about on the alternate day before, and could recollect nothing of"|FALSE
15707|"them on her well-day; she appeared to her friends to possess two minds."|FALSE
15707|"This case also was of epileptic kind, and was cured, with some relapses, by"|FALSE
15707|"opium administered before the commencement of the paroxysm."|FALSE
15707|"4. Whence it appears, that the methods of relieving inflammatory pains, is"|FALSE
15707|"by removing all stimulus, as by venesection, cool air, mucilaginous diet,"|FALSE
15707|"aqueous potation, silence, darkness."|FALSE
15707|"The methods of relieving pains from defect of stimulus is by supplying the"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar stimulus required, as of food, or warmth."|FALSE
15707|"And the general method of relieving pain is by exciting into action some"|FALSE
15707|"great part of the system for the purpose of expending a part of the"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power. This is done either by exertion of the voluntary ideas and"|FALSE
15707|"muscles, as in insanity and convulsion; or by exerting both voluntary and"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive motions, as in reverie; or by exciting the irritative motions by"|FALSE
15707|"wine or opium internally, and by the warm bath or blisters externally; or"|FALSE
15707|"lastly, by exciting the sensitive ideas by good news, affecting stories, or"|FALSE
15707|"agreeable passions."|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. Many synchronous and successive motions of our muscular fibres, and"|FALSE
15707|"of our organs of sense, or ideas, become associated so as to form"|FALSE
15707|"indissoluble tribes or trains of action, as shewn in Section X. on"|FALSE
15707|"Associate Motions. Some constitutions more easily establish these"|FALSE
15707|"associations, whether by voluntary, sensitive, or irritative repetitions,"|FALSE
15707|"and some more easily lose them again, as shewn in Section XXXI. on"|FALSE
15707|"Temperaments."|FALSE
15707|"When the beginning of such a train of actions becomes by any means"|FALSE
15707|"disordered, the succeeding part is liable to become disturbed in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence, and this is commonly termed sympathy or consent of parts by"|FALSE
15707|"the writers of medicine. For the more clear understanding of these"|FALSE
15707|"sympathies we must consider a tribe or train of actions as divided into two"|FALSE
15707|"parts, and call one of them the primary or original motions, and the other"|FALSE
15707|"the secondary or sympathetic ones."|FALSE
15707|"The primary and secondary parts of a train of irritative actions may"|FALSE
15707|"reciprocally affect each other in four different manners. 1. They may both"|FALSE
15707|"be exerted with greater energy than natural. 2. The former may act with"|FALSE
15707|"greater, and the latter with less energy. 3. The former may act with less,"|FALSE
15707|"and the latter with greater energy. 4. They may both act with less energy"|FALSE
15707|"than natural. I shall now give an example of each kind of these modes of"|FALSE
15707|"action, and endeavour to shew, that though the primary and secondary parts"|FALSE
15707|"of these trains or tribes of motion are connected by irritative"|FALSE
15707|"association, or their previous habits of acting together, as described in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XX. on Vertigo. Yet that their acting with similar or dissimilar"|FALSE
15707|"degrees of energy, depends on the greater or less quantity of sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power, which the primary part of the train expends in its exertions."|FALSE
15707|"The actions of the stomach constitute so important a part of the"|FALSE
15707|"associations of both irritative and sensitive motions, that it is said to"|FALSE
15707|"sympathize with almost every part of the body; the first example, which I"|FALSE
15707|"shall adduce to shew that both the primary and secondary parts of a train"|FALSE
15707|"of irritative associations of motion act with increased energy, is taken"|FALSE
15707|"from the consent of the skin with this organ. When the action of the fibres"|FALSE
15707|"of the stomach is increased, as by the stimulus of a full meal, the"|FALSE
15707|"exertions of the cutaneous arteries of the face become increased by their"|FALSE
15707|"irritative associations with those of the stomach, and a glow or flushing"|FALSE
15707|"of the face succeeds. For the small vessels of the skin of the face having"|FALSE
15707|"been more accustomed to the varieties of action, from their frequent"|FALSE
15707|"exposure to various degrees of cold and heat become more easily excited"|FALSE
15707|"into increased action, than those of the covered parts of our bodies, and"|FALSE
15707|"thus act with more energy from their irritative or sensitive associations"|FALSE
15707|"with the stomach. On this account in small-pox the eruption in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"of the previous affection of the stomach breaks out a day sooner on the"|FALSE
15707|"face than on the hands, and two days sooner than on the trunk, and recedes"|FALSE
15707|"in similar times after maturation."|FALSE
15707|"But secondly, in weaker constitutions, that is, in those who possess less"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power, so much of it is expended in the increased actions of the"|FALSE
15707|"fibres of the stomach excited by the stimulus of a meal, that a sense of"|FALSE
15707|"chilness succeeds instead of the universal glow above mentioned; and thus"|FALSE
15707|"the secondary part of the associated train of motions is diminished in"|FALSE
15707|"energy, in consequence of the increased activity of the primary part of it."|FALSE
15707|"2. Another instance of a similar kind, where the secondary part of the"|FALSE
15707|"train acts with less energy in consequence of the greater exertions of the"|FALSE
15707|"primary part, is the vertigo attending intoxication; in this circumstance"|FALSE
15707|"so much sensorial power is expended on the stomach, and on its nearest or"|FALSE
15707|"more strongly associated motions, as those of the subcutaneous vessels, and"|FALSE
15707|"probably of the membranes of some internal viscera, that the irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions of the retina become imperfectly exerted from deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power, as explained in Sect. XX. and XXI. 3. on Vertigo and on"|FALSE
15707|"Drunkenness, and hence the staggering inebriate cannot completely balance"|FALSE
15707|"himself by such indistinct vision."|FALSE
15707|"3. An instance of the third circumstance, where the primary part of a train"|FALSE
15707|"of irritative motions acts with less, and the secondary part with greater"|FALSE
15707|"energy, may be observed by making the following experiment. If a person"|FALSE
15707|"lies with his arms and shoulders out of bed, till they become cold, a"|FALSE
15707|"temporary coryza or catarrh is produced; so that the passage of the"|FALSE
15707|"nostrils becomes totally obstructed; at least this happens to many people;"|FALSE
15707|"and then on covering the arms and shoulders, till they become warm, the"|FALSE
15707|"passage of the nostrils ceases again to be obstructed, and a quantity of"|FALSE
15707|"mucus is discharged from them. In this case the quiescence of the vessels"|FALSE
15707|"of the skin of the arms and shoulders, occasioned by exposure to cold air,"|FALSE
15707|"produces by irritative association an increased action of the vessels of"|FALSE
15707|"the membrane of the nostrils; and the accumulation of sensorial power"|FALSE
15707|"during the torpor of the arms and shoulders is thus expended in producing a"|FALSE
15707|"temporary coryza or catarrh."|FALSE
15707|"Another instance may be adduced from the sympathy or consent of the motions"|FALSE
15707|"of the stomach with other more distant links of the very extensive tribes"|FALSE
15707|"or trains of irritative motions associated with them, described in Sect."|FALSE
15707|"XX. on Vertigo. When the actions of the fibres of the stomach are"|FALSE
15707|"diminished or inverted, the actions of the absorbent vessels, which take up"|FALSE
15707|"the mucus from the lungs, pericardium, and other cells of the body, become"|FALSE
15707|"increased, and absorb the fluids accumulated in them with greater avidity,"|FALSE
15707|"as appears from the exhibition of foxglove, antimony, or other emetics in"|FALSE
15707|"cases of anasarca, attended with unequal pulse and difficult respiration."|FALSE
15707|"That the act of nausea and vomiting is a decreased exertion of the fibres"|FALSE
15707|"of the stomach may be thus deduced; when an emetic medicine is"|FALSE
15707|"administered, it produces the pain of sickness, as a disagreeable taste in"|FALSE
15707|"the mouth produces the pain of nausea; these pains, like that of hunger, or"|FALSE
15707|"of cold, or like those, which are usually termed nervous, as the head-ach"|FALSE
15707|"or hemicrania, do not excite the organ into greater action; but in this"|FALSE

15707|"pleasurable sensation, which seems necessary to digestion, as shewn in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XXXIII. 1. 1. The peristaltic motions of the fibres of the stomach"|FALSE
15707|"become enfeebled by the want of this stimulus of pleasurable sensation, and"|FALSE
15707|"in consequence stop for a time, and then become inverted; for they cannot"|FALSE
15707|"become inverted without being previously stopped. Now that this inversion"|FALSE
15707|"of the trains of motion of the fibres of the stomach is owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"deficiency of pleasurable sensation is evinced from this circumstance, that"|FALSE
15707|"a nauseous idea excited by words will produce vomiting as effectually us a"|FALSE
15707|"nauseous drug."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, that the act of nausea or vomiting expends less sensorial"|FALSE

15707|"vessels, and which are at the same time excited by their usual stimuli."|FALSE
15707|"From this we can understand, how after the operation of an emetic the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach becomes more irritable and sensible to the stimulus, and the"|FALSE
15707|"pleasure of food; since as the sensorial power becomes accumulated during"|FALSE
15707|"the nausea and vomiting, the digestive power is afterwards exerted more"|FALSE
15707|"forceably for a time. It should, however, be here remarked, that though"|FALSE
15707|"vomiting is in general produced by the defect of this stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable sensation, as when a nauseous drug is administered; yet in long"|FALSE
15707|"continued vomiting, as in sea-sickness, or from habitual dram-drinking, it"|FALSE
15707|"arises from deficiency of sensorial power, which in the former case is"|FALSE

15707|"Mrs. ----, about 30 years of age, was seized with great pain about the"|FALSE
15707|"middle of the right parietal bone, which had continued a whole day before I"|FALSE
15707|"saw her, and was so violent as to threaten to occasion convulsions. Not"|FALSE
15707|"being able to detect a decaying tooth, or a tender one, by examination with"|FALSE
15707|"my eye, or by striking them with a tea-spoon, and fearing bad consequences"|FALSE
15707|"from her tendency to convulsion, I advised her to extract the last tooth of"|FALSE
15707|"the under-jaw on the affected side; which was done without any good effect."|FALSE
15707|"She was then directed to lose blood, and to take a brisk cathartic; and"|FALSE
15707|"after that had operated, about 60 drops of laudanum were given her, with"|FALSE
15707|"large doses of bark; by which the pain was removed. In about a fortnight"|FALSE
15707|"she took a cathartic medicine by ill advice, and the pain returned with"|FALSE
15707|"greater violence in the same place; and, before I could arrive, as she"|FALSE
15707|"lived 30 miles from me, she suffered a paralytic stroke; which affected her"|FALSE
15707|"limbs and her face on one side, and relieved the pain of her head."|FALSE
15707|"About a year afterwards I was again called to her on account of a pain as"|FALSE
15707|"violent as before exactly on the same part of the other parietal bone. On"|FALSE
15707|"examining her mouth I found the second molaris of the under-jaw on the side"|FALSE
15707|"before affected was now decayed, and concluded, that this tooth had"|FALSE
15707|"occasioned the stroke of the palsy by the pain and consequent exertion it"|FALSE
15707|"had caused. On this account I earnestly entreated her to allow the sound"|FALSE
15707|"molaris of the same jaw opposite to the decayed one to be extracted; which"|FALSE
15707|"was forthwith done, and the pain of her head immediately ceased, to the"|FALSE
15707|"astonishment of her attendants."|FALSE
15707|"In the cases above related of the pain existing in a part distant from the"|FALSE
15707|"seat of the disease, the pain is owing to defect of the usual motions of"|FALSE
15707|"the painful part. This appears from the coldness, paleness, and emptiness"|FALSE
15707|"of the affected vessels, or of the extremities of the body in general, and"|FALSE
15707|"from there being no tendency to inflammation. The increased action of the"|FALSE
15707|"primary part of these associated motions, as of the hepatic termination of"|FALSE
15707|"the bile-duct; from the stimulus of a gall-stone, or of the interior"|FALSE
15707|"termination of the urethra from the stimulus of a stone in the bladder, or"|FALSE
15707|"lastly, of a decaying tooth in hemicrania, deprives the secondary part of"|FALSE
15707|"these associated motions, namely, the exterior terminations of the"|FALSE
15707|"bile-duct or urethra, or the pained membranes of the head in hemicrania, of"|FALSE
15707|"their natural share of sensorial power: and hence the secondary parts of"|FALSE
15707|"these sensitive trains of association become pained from the deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"their usual motions, which is accompanied with deficiency of secretions and"|FALSE
15707|"of heat. See Sect. IV. 5. XII. 5. 3. XXXIV. 1."|FALSE
15707|"Why does the pain of the primary part of the association cease, when that"|FALSE
15707|"of the secondary part commences? This is a question of intricacy, but"|FALSE
15707|"perhaps not inexplicable. The pain of the primary part of these associated"|FALSE
15707|"trains of motion was owing to too great stimulus, as of the stone at the"|FALSE
15707|"neck of the bladder, and was consequently caused by too great action of the"|FALSE
15707|"pained part. This greater action than natural of the primary part of these"|FALSE
15707|"associated motions, by employing or expending the sensorial power of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation belonging to the whole associated train of motions, occasioned"|FALSE
15707|"torpor, and consequent pain in the secondary part of the associated train;"|FALSE
15707|"which was possessed of greater sensibility than the primary part of it. Now"|FALSE
15707|"the great pain of the secondary part of the train, as soon as it commences,"|FALSE
15707|"employs or expends the sensorial power of sensation belonging to the whole"|FALSE
15707|"associated train of motions; and in consequence the motions of the primary"|FALSE
15707|"part, though increased by the stimulus of an extraneous body, cease to be"|FALSE
15707|"accompanied with pain or sensation."|FALSE
15707|"If this mode of reasoning be just it explains a curious fact, why when two"|FALSE
15707|"parts of the body are strongly stimulated, the pain is felt only in one of"|FALSE
15707|"them, though it is possible by voluntary attention it may be alternately"|FALSE
15707|"perceived in them both. In the same manner, when two new ideas are"|FALSE
15707|"presented to us from the stimulus of external bodies, we attend to but one"|FALSE
15707|"of them at a time. In other words, when one set of fibres, whether of the"|FALSE
15707|"muscles or organs of sense, contract so strongly as to excite much"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; another set of fibres contracting more weakly do not excite"|FALSE
15707|"sensation at all, because the sensorial power of sensation is pre-occupied"|FALSE
15707|"by the first set of fibres. So we cannot will more than one effect at once,"|FALSE
15707|"though by associations previously formed we can move many fibres in"|FALSE
15707|"combination."|FALSE
15707|"Thus in the instances above related, the termination of the bile duct in"|FALSE
15707|"the duodenum, and the exterior extremity of the urethra, are more sensible"|FALSE
15707|"than their other terminations. When these parts are deprived of their usual"|FALSE
15707|"motions by deficiency of sensorial power, as above explained, they become"|FALSE
15707|"painful according to law the fifth in Section IV. and the less pain"|FALSE
15707|"originally excited by the stimulus of concreted bile, or of a stone at"|FALSE
15707|"their other extremities ceases to be perceived. Afterwards, however, when"|FALSE
15707|"the concretions of bile, or the stone on the urinary bladder, become more"|FALSE
15707|"numerous or larger, the pain from their increased stimulus becomes greater"|FALSE
15707|"than the associated pain; and is then felt at the neck of the gall bladder"|FALSE
15707|"or urinary bladder; and the pain of the glans penis, or at the pit of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, ceases to be perceived."|FALSE
15707|"2. Examples of the second mode, where the increased action of the primary"|FALSE
15707|"part of a train of sensitive association ceases, when that of the secondary"|FALSE
15707|"part commences, are also not unfrequent; as this is the usual manner of the"|FALSE
15707|"translation of inflammations from internal to external parts of the system,"|FALSE
15707|"such as when an inflammation of the liver or stomach is translated to the"|FALSE
15707|"membranes of the foot, and forms the gout; or to the skin of the face, and"|FALSE
15707|"forms the rosy drop; or when an inflammation of the membranes of the"|FALSE
15707|"kidneys is translated to the skin of the loins, and forms one kind of"|FALSE
15707|"herpes, called shingles; in these cases by whatever cause the original"|FALSE
15707|"inflammation may have been produced, as the secondary part of the train of"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive association is more sensible, it becomes exerted with greater"|FALSE
15707|"violence than the first part of it; and by both its increased pain, and the"|FALSE
15707|"increased motion of its fibres, so far diminishes or exhausts the sensorial"|FALSE
15707|"power of sensation; that the primary part of the train being less sensible"|FALSE
15707|"ceases both to feel pain, and to act with unnatural energy."|FALSE
15707|"3. Examples of the third mode, where the primary part of a train of"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive association of motions may experience increased sensation, and"|FALSE
15707|"the secondary part increased action, are likewise not unfrequent; as it is"|FALSE
15707|"in this manner that most inflammations commence. Thus, after standing some"|FALSE
15707|"time in snow, the feet become affected with the pain of cold, and a common"|FALSE
15707|"coryza, or inflammation of the membrane of the nostrils, succeeds. It is"|FALSE
15707|"probable that the internal inflammations, as pleurisies, or hepatitis,"|FALSE
15707|"which are produced after the cold paroxysm of fever, originate in the same"|FALSE
15707|"manner from the sympathy of those parts with some others, which were"|FALSE
15707|"previously pained from quiescence; as happens to various parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"system during the cold fits of fevers. In these cases it would seem, that"|FALSE
15707|"the sensorial power of sensation becomes accumulated during the pain of"|FALSE
15707|"cold, as the torpor of the vessels occasioned by the defect of heat"|FALSE
15707|"contributes to the increase or accumulation of the sensorial power of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, and that both these become exerted on some internal part, which"|FALSE
15707|"was not rendered torpid by the cold which affected the external parts, nor"|FALSE
15707|"by its association with them; or which sooner recovered its sensibility."|FALSE
15707|"This requires further consideration."|FALSE
15707|"4. An example of the fourth mode, or where the primary part of a sensitive"|FALSE
15707|"association of motions may have increased action, and the secondary part"|FALSE
15707|"increased sensation, may be taken from the pain of the shoulder, which"|FALSE
15707|"attends inflammation of the membranes of the liver, see Class IV. 2. 2. 9.;"|FALSE
15707|"in this circumstance so much sensorial power seems to be expended in the"|FALSE
15707|"violent actions and sensations of the inflamed membranes of the liver, that"|FALSE
15707|"the membranes associated with them become quiescent to their usual stimuli,"|FALSE
15707|"and painful in consequence."|FALSE
15707|"There may be other modes in which the primary and secondary parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"trains of associated sensitive motions may reciprocally affect each other,"|FALSE
15707|"as may be seen by looking over Class IV. in the catalogue of diseases; all"|FALSE
15707|"which may probably be resolved into the plus and minus of sensorial power,"|FALSE
15707|"but we have not yet had sufficient observations made upon them with a view"|FALSE
15707|"to this doctrine."|FALSE
15707|"III. The associated trains of our ideas may have sympathies, and their"|FALSE
15707|"primary and secondary parts affect each other in some manner similar to"|FALSE
15707|"those above described; and may thus occasion various curious phenomena not"|FALSE
15707|"yet adverted to, besides those explained in the Sections on Dreams,"|FALSE

15707|"limits; and are liable to wake at a certain hour, whether we went to bed"|FALSE
15707|"earlier or later, within certain limits. Hence it appears, that those who"|FALSE
15707|"complain of want of sleep, will be liable to sleep better or longer, if"|FALSE
15707|"they accustom themselves to go to rest, and to rise, at certain hours."|FALSE
15707|"The periods of evacuating the bowels are generally connected with some part"|FALSE
15707|"of the solar day, as well as with the acrimony or distention occasioned by"|FALSE
15707|"the feces. Hence one method of correcting costiveness is by endeavouring to"|FALSE
15707|"establish a habit of evacuation at a certain hour of the day, as"|FALSE
15707|"recommended by Mr. Locke, which may be accomplished by using daily"|FALSE
15707|"voluntary efforts at those times, joined with the usual stimulus of the"|FALSE
15707|"material to be evacuated."|FALSE
15707|"3. The following natural animal actions are connected with lunar periods."|FALSE
15707|"1. The periods of female menstruation are connected with lunar periods to"|FALSE
15707|"great exactness, in some instances even to a few hours. These do not"|FALSE
15707|"commence or terminate at the full or change, or at any other particular"|FALSE
15707|"part of the lunation, but after they have commenced at any part of it, they"|FALSE
15707|"continue to recur at that part with great regularity, unless disturbed by"|FALSE
15707|"some violent circumstance, as explained in Sect. XXXII. No. 6. their return"|FALSE
15707|"is immediately caused by deficient venous absorption, which is owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"want of the stimulus, designed by nature, of amatorial copulation, or of"|FALSE
15707|"the growing fetus. When the catamenia returns sooner than the period of"|FALSE
15707|"lunation, it shows a tendency of the constitution to inirritability; that"|FALSE
15707|"is to debility, or deficiency of sensorial power, and is to be relieved by"|FALSE
15707|"small doses of steel and opium."|FALSE
15707|"The venereal orgasm of birds and quadrupeds seems to commence, or return"|FALSE
15707|"about the most powerful lunations at the vernal or autumnal equinoxes; but"|FALSE
15707|"if it be disappointed of its object, it is said to recur at monthly"|FALSE
15707|"periods; in this respect resembling the female catamenia. Whence it is"|FALSE
15707|"believed, that women are more liable to become pregnant at or about the"|FALSE
15707|"time of their catamenia, than at the intermediate times; and on this"|FALSE
15707|"account they are seldom much mistaken in their reckoning of nine lunar"|FALSE
15707|"periods from the last menstruation; the inattention to this may sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"have been the cause of supposed barrenness, and is therefore worth the"|FALSE
15707|"observation of those, who wish to have children."|FALSE
15707|"III. We now come to the periods of diseased animal actions. The periods of"|FALSE
15707|"fever-fits, which depend on the stated returns of nocturnal cold, are"|FALSE
15707|"discussed in Sect. XXXII. 3. Those, which originate or recur at solar or"|FALSE
15707|"lunar periods, are also explained in Section XXXII. 6. These we shall here"|FALSE
15707|"enumerate; observing, however, that it is not more surprising, that the"|FALSE
15707|"influence of the varying attractions of the sun and moon, should raise the"|FALSE
15707|"ocean into mountains, than that it should affect the nice sensibilities of"|FALSE
15707|"animal bodies; though the manner of its operation on them is difficult to"|FALSE
15707|"be understood. It is probable however, that as this influence gradually"|FALSE
15707|"lessens during the course of the day, or of the lunation, or of the year,"|FALSE
15707|"some actions of our system become less and less; till at length a total"|FALSE
15707|"quiescence of some part is induced; which is the commencement of the"|FALSE
15707|"paroxysms of fever, of menstruation, of pain with decreased action of the"|FALSE
15707|"affected organ, and of consequent convulsion."|FALSE
15707|"1. A diurnal fever in some weak people is distinctly observed to come on"|FALSE
15707|"towards evening, and to cease with a moist skin early in the morning,"|FALSE
15707|"obeying the solar periods. Persons of weak constitutions are liable to get"|FALSE
15707|"into better spirits at the access of the hot fit of this evening fever; and"|FALSE
15707|"are thence inclined to sit up late; which by further enfeebling them"|FALSE
15707|"increases the disease; whence they lose their strength and their colour."|FALSE
15707|"2. The periods of hectic fever, supposed to arise from absorption of"|FALSE
15707|"matter, obeys the diurnal periods like the above, having the exacerbescence"|FALSE
15707|"towards evening, and its remission early in the morning, with sweats, or"|FALSE
15707|"diarrhoea, or urine with white sediment."|FALSE
15707|"3. The periods of quotidian fever are either catenated with solar time, and"|FALSE
15707|"return at the intervals of twenty-four hours; or with lunar time, recurring"|FALSE
15707|"at the intervals of about twenty-five hours. There is great use in knowing"|FALSE
15707|"with what circumstances the periodical return or new morbid motions are"|FALSE
15707|"conjoined, as the most effectual times of exhibiting the proper medicines"|FALSE
15707|"are thus determined. So if the torpor, which ushers in an ague fit, is"|FALSE
15707|"catenated with the lunar day: it is known, when the bark or opium must be"|FALSE
15707|"given, so as to exert its principal effect about the time of the expected"|FALSE
15707|"return. Solid opium should be given about an hour before the expected cold"|FALSE
15707|"fit; liquid opium and wine about half an hour; the bark repeatedly for six"|FALSE
15707|"or eight hours previous to the expected return."|FALSE
15707|"4. The periods of tertian fevers, reckoned from the commencement of one"|FALSE
15707|"cold fit to the commencement of the next cold fit, recur with solar"|FALSE
15707|"intervals of forty-eight hours, or with lunar ones of about fifty hours."|FALSE
15707|"When these of recurrence begin one or two hours earlier than the solar"|FALSE
15707|"period, it shews, that the torpor or cold fit is produced by less external"|FALSE
15707|"influence; and therefore that it is more liable to degenerate into a fever"|FALSE
15707|"with only remissions; so when menstruation recurs sooner than the period of"|FALSE
15707|"lunation, it shews a tendency of the habit to torpor of inirritability."|FALSE
15707|"5. The periods of quartan fevers return at solar intervals of seventy-two"|FALSE
15707|"hours, or at lunar ones of about seventy-four hours and an half. This kind"|FALSE
15707|"of ague appears most in moist cold autumns, and in cold countries replete"|FALSE
15707|"with marshes. It is attended with greater debility, and its cold access"|FALSE
15707|"more difficult to prevent. For where there is previously a deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"sensorial power, the constitution is liable to run into greater torpor from"|FALSE
15707|"any further diminution of it; two ounces of bark and some steel should be"|FALSE
15707|"given on the day before the return of the cold paroxysm, and a pint of wine"|FALSE
15707|"by degrees a few hours before its return, and thirty drops of laudanum one"|FALSE
15707|"hour before the expected cold fit."|FALSE
15707|"6. The periods of the gout generally commence about an hour before"|FALSE
15707|"sun-rise, which is usually the coldest part of the twenty-four hours. The"|FALSE
15707|"greater periods of the gout seem also to observe the solar influence,"|FALSE
15707|"returning about the same season of the year."|FALSE
15707|"7. The periods of the pleurisy recur with exacerbation of the pain and"|FALSE
15707|"fever about sun-set, at which time venesection is of most service. The same"|FALSE
15707|"may be observed of the inflammatory rheumatism, and other fevers with"|FALSE
15707|"arterial strength, which seem to obey solar periods; and those with"|FALSE
15707|"debility seem to obey lunar ones."|FALSE
15707|"8. The periods of fevers with arterial debility seem to obey the lunar day,"|FALSE
15707|"having their access daily nearly an hour later; and have sometimes two"|FALSE
15707|"accesses in a day, resembling the lunar effects upon the tides."|FALSE
15707|"9. The periods of rhaphania, or convulsions of the limbs from rheumatic"|FALSE
15707|"pains, seem to be connected with solar influence, returning at nearly the"|FALSE
15707|"same hour for weeks together, unless disturbed by the exhibition of"|FALSE
15707|"powerful doses of opium."|FALSE
15707|"So the periods of Tussis ferina, or violent cough with slow pulse, called"|FALSE
15707|"nervous cough, recurs by solar periods. Five grains of opium, given at the"|FALSE
15707|"time the cough commenced disturbed the period, from seven in the evening to"|FALSE
15707|"eleven, at which time it regularly returned for some days, during which"|FALSE
15707|"time the opium was gradually omitted. Then 120 drops of laudanum were given"|FALSE
15707|"an hour before the access of the cough, and it totally ceased. The laudanum"|FALSE
15707|"was continued a fortnight, and then gradually discontinued."|FALSE
15707|"10. The periods of hemicrania, and of painful epilepsy, are liable to obey"|FALSE
15707|"lunar periods, both in their diurnal returns, and in their greater periods"|FALSE
15707|"of weeks, but are also induced by other exciting causes."|FALSE
15707|"11. The periods of arterial hæmorrhages seem to return at solar periods"|FALSE
15707|"about the same hour of the evening or morning. Perhaps the venous"|FALSE
15707|"hæmorrhages obey the lunar periods, as the catamenia, and hæmorrhoids."|FALSE
15707|"12. The periods of the hæmorrhoids, or piles, in some recur monthly, in"|FALSE
15707|"others only at the greater lunar influence about the equinoxes."|FALSE
15707|"13. The periods of hæmoptoe sometimes obey solar influence, recurring early"|FALSE
15707|"in the morning for several days; and sometimes lunar periods, recurring"|FALSE
15707|"monthly; and sometimes depend on our hours of sleep. See Class I. 2. 1. 9."|FALSE
15707|"14. Many of the first periods of epileptic fits obey the monthly lunation"|FALSE
15707|"with some degree of accuracy; others recur only at the most powerful"|FALSE
15707|"lunations before the vernal equinox, and after the autumnal one; but when"|FALSE
15707|"the constitution has gained a habit of relieving disagreeable sensations by"|FALSE
15707|"this kind of exertion, the fit recurs from any slight cause."|FALSE
15707|"15. The attack of palsy and apoplexy are known to recur with great"|FALSE
15707|"frequency about the equinoxes."|FALSE
15707|"16. There are numerous instances of the effect of the lunations upon the"|FALSE
15707|"periods of insanity, whence the name of lunatic has been given to those"|FALSE
15707|"afflicted with this disease."|FALSE
15707|"IV. The critical days, in which fevers are supposed to terminate, have"|FALSE
15707|"employed the attention of medical philosophers from the days of Hippocrates"|FALSE
15707|"to the present time. In whatever part of a lunation a fever commences,"|FALSE
15707|"which owes either its whole cause to solar and lunar influence, or to this"|FALSE
15707|"in conjunction with other causes; it would seem, that the effect would be"|FALSE
15707|"the greatest at the full and new moon, as the tides rise highest at those"|FALSE
15707|"times, and would be the least at the quadratures; thus if a fever-fit"|FALSE
15707|"should commence at the new or full moon, occasioned by the solar and lunar"|FALSE
15707|"attraction diminishing some chemical affinity of the particles of blood,"|FALSE
15707|"and thence decreasing their stimulus on our sanguiferous system, as"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned in Sect. XXXII. 6. this effect will daily decrease for the first"|FALSE
15707|"seven days, and will then increase till about the fourteenth day, and will"|FALSE
15707|"again decrease till about the twenty-first day, and increase again till the"|FALSE
15707|"end of the lunation. If a fever-fit from the above cause should commence on"|FALSE
15707|"the seventh day after either lunation, the reverse of the above"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances would happen. Now it is probable, that those fevers, whose"|FALSE
15707|"crisis or terminations are influenced by lunations, may begin at one or"|FALSE
15707|"other of the above times, namely at the changes or quadratures; though"|FALSE
15707|"sufficient observations have not been made to ascertain this circumstance."|FALSE
15707|"Hence I conclude, that the small-pox and measles have their critical days,"|FALSE
15707|"not governed by the times required for certain chemical changes in the"|FALSE
15707|"blood, which affect or alter the stimulus of the contagious matter, but"|FALSE
15707|"from the daily increasing or decreasing effect of this lunar link of"|FALSE
15707|"catenation, as explained in Section XVII. 3. 3. And as other fevers"|FALSE
15707|"terminate most frequently about the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first, or"|FALSE
15707|"about the end of four weeks, when no medical assistance has disturbed their"|FALSE
15707|"periods, I conclude, that these crises, or terminations, are governed by"|FALSE
15707|"periods of the lunations; though we are still ignorant of their manner of"|FALSE
15707|"operation."|FALSE
15707|"In the distinct small-pox the vestiges of lunation are very apparent, after"|FALSE
15707|"inoculation a quarter of a lunation precedes the commencement of the fever,"|FALSE
15707|"another quarter terminates with the complete eruption, another quarter with"|FALSE
15707|"the complete maturation, and another quarter terminates the complete"|FALSE
15707|"absorption of a material now rendered inoffensive to the constitution."|FALSE

15707|"I. The larger crystals of saline bodies may be conceived to arise from the"|FALSE
15707|"combination of smaller crystals of the same form, owing to the greater"|FALSE
15707|"attractions of their sides than of their angles. Thus if four cubes were"|FALSE
15707|"floating in a fluid, whose friction or resistance is nothing, it is certain"|FALSE
15707|"the sides of these cubes would attract each other stronger than their"|FALSE
15707|"angles; and hence that these four smaller cubes would so arrange themselves"|FALSE
15707|"as to produce one larger one."|FALSE
15707|"There are other means of chemical accretion, such as the depositions of"|FALSE
15707|"dissolved calcareous or siliceous particles, as are seen in the formation"|FALSE
15707|"of the stalactites of limestone in Derbyshire, or of calcedone in Cornwall."|FALSE
15707|"Other means of adhesion are produced by heat and pressure, as in the"|FALSE
15707|"welding of iron-bars; and other means by simple pressure, as in forcing two"|FALSE
15707|"pieces of caoutchou, or elastic gum, to adhere; and lastly, by the"|FALSE
15707|"agglutination of a third substance penetrating the pores of the other two,"|FALSE
15707|"as in the agglutination of wood by means of animal gluten. Though the"|FALSE
15707|"ultimate particles of animal bodies are held together during life, as well"|FALSE
15707|"as after death, by their specific attraction of cohesion, like all other"|FALSE
15707|"matter; yet it does not appear, that their original organization was"|FALSE
15707|"produced by chemical laws, and their production and increase must therefore"|FALSE
15707|"only be looked for from the laws of animation."|FALSE
15707|"II. When the pain of hunger requires relief, certain parts of the material"|FALSE
15707|"world, which surround us, when applied to our palates, excite into action"|FALSE
15707|"the muscles of deglutition; and the material is swallowed into the stomach."|FALSE
15707|"Here the new aliment becomes mixed with certain animal fluids, and"|FALSE
15707|"undergoes a chemical process, termed digestion; which however chemistry has"|FALSE
15707|"not yet learnt to imitate out of the bodies of living animals or"|FALSE
15707|"vegetables. This process seems very similar to the saccharine process in"|FALSE
15707|"the lobes of farinaceous seeds, as of barley, when it begins to germinate;"|FALSE
15707|"except that, along with the sugar, oil and mucilage are also produced;"|FALSE
15707|"which form the chyle of animals, which is very similar to their milk."|FALSE
15707|"The reason, I imagine, why this chyle-making, or saccharine process, has"|FALSE
15707|"not yet been imitated by chemical operations, is owing to the materials"|FALSE
15707|"being in such a situation in respect to warmth, moisture, and motion; that"|FALSE
15707|"they will immediately change into the vinous or acetous fermentation;"|FALSE
15707|"except the new sugar be absorbed by the numerous lacteal or lymphatic"|FALSE
15707|"vessels, as soon as it is produced; which is not easy to imitate in the"|FALSE
15707|"laboratory."|FALSE
15707|"These lacteal vessels have mouths, which are irritated into action by the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of the fluid, which surrounds them; and by animal selection, or"|FALSE
15707|"appetency, they absorb such part of the fluid as is agreeable to their"|FALSE
15707|"palate; those parts, for instance, which are already converted into chyle,"|FALSE
15707|"before they have time to undergo another change by a vinous or acetous"|FALSE
15707|"fermentation. This animal absorption of fluid is almost visible to the"|FALSE
15707|"naked eye in the action of the puncta lacrymalia; which imbibe the tears"|FALSE
15707|"from the eye, and discharge them again into the nostrils."|FALSE
15707|"III. The arteries constitute another reservoir of a changeful fluid; from"|FALSE
15707|"which, after its recent oxygenation in the lungs, a further animal"|FALSE
15707|"selection of various fluids is absorbed by the numerous glands; these"|FALSE
15707|"select their respective fluids from the blood, which is perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"undergoing a chemical change; but the selection by these glands, like that"|FALSE
15707|"of the lacteals, which open their mouths into the digesting aliment in the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, is from animal appetency, not from chemical affinity; secretion"|FALSE
15707|"cannot therefore be imitated in the laboratory, as it consists in a"|FALSE
15707|"selection of part of a fluid during the chemical change of that fluid."|FALSE
15707|"The mouths of the lacteals, and lymphatics, and the ultimate terminations"|FALSE
15707|"of the glands, are finer than can easily be conceived; yet it is probable,"|FALSE
15707|"that the pores, or interstices of the parts, or coats, which constitute"|FALSE
15707|"these ultimate vessels, may still have greater tenuity; and that these"|FALSE
15707|"pores from the above analogy must posses a similar power of irritability,"|FALSE
15707|"and absorb by their living energy the particles of fluid adapted to their"|FALSE
15707|"purposes, whether to replace the parts abraded or dissolved, or to elongate"|FALSE
15707|"and enlarge themselves. Not only every kind of gland is thus endued with"|FALSE
15707|"its peculiar appetency, and selects the material agreeable to its taste"|FALSE
15707|"from the blood, but every individual pore acquires by animal selection the"|FALSE
15707|"material, which it wants; and thus nutrition seems to be performed in a"|FALSE
15707|"manner so similar to secretion; that they only differ in the one retaining,"|FALSE
15707|"and the other parting again with the particles, which they have selected"|FALSE
15707|"from the blood."|FALSE
15707|"This way of accounting for nutrition from stimulus, and the consequent"|FALSE
15707|"animal selection of particles, is much more analogous to other phenomena of"|FALSE
15707|"the animal microcosm, than by having recourse to the microscopic"|FALSE
15707|"animalcula, or organic particles of Buffon, and Needham; which being"|FALSE
15707|"already compounded must themselves require nutritive particles to continue"|FALSE
15707|"their own existence. And must be liable to undergo a change by our"|FALSE
15707|"digestive or secretory organs; otherwise mankind would soon resemble by"|FALSE
15707|"their theory the animals, which they feed upon. He, who is nourished by"|FALSE
15707|"beef or venison, would in time become horned; and he, who feeds on pork or"|FALSE
15707|"bacon, would gain a nose proper for rooting into the earth, as well as for"|FALSE
15707|"the perception of odours."|FALSE
15707|"The whole animal system may be considered as consisting of the extremities"|FALSE
15707|"of the nerves, or of having been produced from them; if we except perhaps"|FALSE
15707|"the medullary part of the brain residing in the head and spine, and in the"|FALSE
15707|"trunks of the nerves. These extremities of the nerves are either of those"|FALSE
15707|"of locomotion, which are termed muscular fibres; or of those of sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"which constitute the immediate organs of sense, and which have also their"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar motions. Now as the fibres, which constitute the bones and"|FALSE
15707|"membranes, possessed originally sensation and motion; and are liable again"|FALSE
15707|"to possess them, when they become inflamed; it follows, that those were,"|FALSE
15707|"when first formed, appendages to the nerves of sensation or locomotion, or"|FALSE
15707|"were formed from them. And that hence all these solid parts of the body, as"|FALSE
15707|"they have originally consisted of extremities of nerves, require an"|FALSE
15707|"apposition of nutritive particles of a similar kind, contrary to the"|FALSE
15707|"opinion of Buffon and Needham above recited."|FALSE
15707|"Lastly, as all these filaments have possessed, or do possess, the power of"|FALSE
15707|"contraction, and of consequent inertion or elongation; it seems probable,"|FALSE
15707|"that the nutritive particles are applied during their times of elongation;"|FALSE
15707|"when their original constituent particles are removed to a greater distance"|FALSE
15707|"from each other. For each muscular or sensual fibre may be considered as a"|FALSE
15707|"row or string of beads; which approach, when in contraction, and recede"|FALSE
15707|"during its rest or elongation; and our daily experience shews us, that"|FALSE
15707|"great action emaciates the system, and that it is repaired during rest."|FALSE
15707|"Something like this is seen out of the body; for if a hair, or a single"|FALSE
15707|"untwisted fibre of flax or silk, be soaked in water; it becomes longer and"|FALSE
15707|"thicker by the water, which is absorbed into its pores. Now if a hair could"|FALSE
15707|"be supposed to be thus immersed in a solution of particles similar to"|FALSE
15707|"those, which compose it; one may imagine, that it might be thus increased"|FALSE
15707|"in weight and magnitude; as the particles of oak-bark increase the"|FALSE
15707|"substance of the hides of beasts in the process of making leather. I"|FALSE
15707|"mention these not as philosophic analogies, but as similes to facilitate"|FALSE
15707|"our ideas, how an accretion of parts may be effected by animal appetences,"|FALSE
15707|"or selections, in a manner somewhat similar to mechanical or chemical"|FALSE
15707|"attractions."|FALSE
15707|"If those new particles of matter, previously prepared by digestion and"|FALSE
15707|"sanguification, only supply the places of those, which have been abraded by"|FALSE
15707|"the actions of the system, it is properly termed nutrition. If they are"|FALSE
15707|"applied to the extremities of the nervous fibrils, or in such quantity as"|FALSE
15707|"to increase the length or crassitude of them, the body becomes at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time enlarged, and its growth is increased, as well as its deficiences"|FALSE
15707|"repaired."|FALSE
15707|"In this last case something more than a simple apposition or selection of"|FALSE
15707|"particles seems to be necessary; as many parts of the system during its"|FALSE
15707|"growth are caused to recede from those, with which they were before in"|FALSE
15707|"contact; as the ends of the bones, or cartilages, recede from each other,"|FALSE
15707|"as their growth advances: this process resembles inflammation, as appears"|FALSE
15707|"in ophthalmy, or in the production of new flesh in ulcers, where old"|FALSE
15707|"vessels are enlarged, and new ones produced; and like that is attended with"|FALSE
15707|"sensation. In this situation the vessels become distended with blood, and"|FALSE
15707|"acquire greater sensibility, and may thus be compared to the erection of"|FALSE
15707|"the penis, or of the nipples of the breasts of women; while new particles"|FALSE
15707|"become added at the same time; as in the process of nutrition above"|FALSE
15707|"described."|FALSE
15707|"When only the natural growth of the various parts of the body are produced,"|FALSE
15707|"a pleasurable sensation attends it, as in youth, and perhaps in those, who"|FALSE
15707|"are in the progress of becoming fat. When an unnatural growth is the"|FALSE
15707|"consequence, as in inflammatory diseases, a painful sensation attends the"|FALSE
15707|"enlargement of the system."|FALSE
15707|"IV. This apposition of new parts, as the old ones disappear, selected from"|FALSE
15707|"the aliment we take, first enlarges and strengthens our bodies for twenty"|FALSE
15707|"years, for another twenty years it keeps us in health and vigour, and adds"|FALSE
15707|"strength and solidity to the system; and then gradually ceases to nourish"|FALSE

15707|"might have been easier for nature to have supported her progeny for ever in"|FALSE
15707|"health and life, than to have perpetually reproduced them by the wonderful"|FALSE

15707|"cease to obey the stimulus of the aliment, which should support us. After"|FALSE
15707|"we have acquired our height and solidity we make no more new parts, and the"|FALSE

15707|"with, less and less energy, till the whole sinks into inaction."|FALSE
15707|"Three causes may conspire to render our nerves less excitable, which have"|FALSE
15707|"been already mentioned, 1. If a stimulus be greater than natural, it"|FALSE
15707|"produces too great an exertion of the stimulated organ, and in consequence"|FALSE
15707|"exhausts the spirit of animation; and the moving organ ceases to act, even"|FALSE

15707|"exhaustion, yet some degree of permanent injury remains, as is evident"|FALSE
15707|"after exposing the eyes long to too strong a light. 2. If excitations"|FALSE
15707|"weaker than natural be applied, so as not to excite the organ into action,"|FALSE
15707|"(as when small doses of aloe or rhubarb are exhibited,) they may be"|FALSE
15707|"gradually increased, without exciting the organ into action; which will"|FALSE
15707|"thus acquire a habit of disobedience to the stimulus; thus by increasing"|FALSE
15707|"the dose by degrees, great quantities of opium or wine may be taken without"|FALSE
15707|"intoxication. See Sect. XII. 3. 1."|FALSE
15707|"3. Another mode, by which life is gradually undermined, is when irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions continue to be produced in consequence of stimulus, but are not"|FALSE
15707|"succeeded by sensation; hence the stimulus of contagious matter is not"|FALSE
15707|"capable of producing fever a second time, because it is not succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation. See Sect. XII. 3. 6. And hence, owing to the want of the general"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable sensation, which ought to attend digestion and glandular"|FALSE
15707|"secretion, an irksomeness of life ensues; and, where this is in greater"|FALSE
15707|"excess, the melancholy of old age occurs, with torpor or debility."|FALSE
15707|"From hence I conclude, that it is probable that the fibrillæ, or moving"|FALSE

15707|"like the other parts of the body; but only enlarged or elongated with our"|FALSE

15707|"Whence, instead of gradually changing the old animal, the generation of a"|FALSE

15707|"I. From the recent discoveries of many ingenious philosophers it appears,"|FALSE
15707|"that during respiration the blood imbibes the vital part of the air, called"|FALSE

15707|"acid (as in the production of vitriolic acid from sulphur, or carbonic acid"|FALSE
15707|"from charcoal,) giving out at the same time a quantity of the matter of"|FALSE
15707|"heat; so in respiration the oxygene of the air unites with the phlogistic"|FALSE

15707|"some of the matter of heat is at the same time given out according to the"|FALSE

15707|"of the various fluids from the blood; and that the constant combinations or"|FALSE

15707|"evolution of the matter of heat in the blush of shame or of anger; in which"|FALSE
15707|"at the same time an increased secretion of the perspirable matter occurs;"|FALSE
15707|"and the partial evolution of it from topical inflammations, as in gout or"|FALSE

15707|"Some medical philosophers have ascribed the heat of animal bodies to the"|FALSE

15707|"Besides the supposed production of phosphoric acid, and change of colour of"|FALSE
15707|"the blood, and the production of carbonic acid, there would appear to be"|FALSE
15707|"something of a more subtile nature perpetually acquired from the"|FALSE
15707|"atmosphere; which is too fine to be long contained in animal vessels, and"|FALSE
15707|"therefore requires perpetual renovation; and without which life cannot"|FALSE

15707|"That the blood acquires something from the air, which is immediately"|FALSE

15707|"as mentioned in Derham's Physico-theology. Many other physicians seem to"|FALSE
15707|"have espoused the same opinion, as noticed by Haller. Elem. Physiologiæ, T."|FALSE
15707|"1. Dr. Gipson published a defence of this theory in the Medical Essays of"|FALSE
15707|"Edinburgh, Vol. I. and II. which doctrine is there controverted at large by"|FALSE
15707|"the late Alexander Monro; and since that time the general opinion has been,"|FALSE
15707|"that the placenta is an organ of nutrition only, owing perhaps rather to"|FALSE
15707|"the authority of so great a name, than to the validity of the arguments"|FALSE
15707|"adduced in its support. The subject has lately been resumed by Dr. James"|FALSE
15707|"Jeffray, and by Dr. Forester French, in their inaugural dissertations at"|FALSE
15707|"Edinburgh and at Cambridge; who have defended the contrary opinion in an"|FALSE
15707|"able and ingenious manner; and from whose Theses I have extracted many of"|FALSE
15707|"the following remarks."|FALSE
15707|"First, by the late discoveries of Dr. Priestley, M. Lavoisier, and other"|FALSE
15707|"philosophers, it appears, that the basis of atmospherical air, called"|FALSE
15707|"oxygene, is received by the blood through the membranes of the lungs; and"|FALSE
15707|"that by this addition the colour of the blood is changed from a dark to a"|FALSE
15707|"light red. Secondly, that water possesses oxygene also as a part of its"|FALSE
15707|"composition, and contains air likewise in its pores; whence the blood of"|FALSE
15707|"fish receives oxygene from the water, or from the air it contains, by means"|FALSE
15707|"of their gills, in the same manner as the blood is oxygenated in the lungs"|FALSE
15707|"of air-breathing animals; it changes its colour at the same time from a"|FALSE
15707|"dark to a light red in the vessels of their gills, which constitute a"|FALSE
15707|"pulmonary organ adapted to the medium in which they live. Thirdly, that the"|FALSE
15707|"placenta consists of arteries carrying the blood to its extremities, and a"|FALSE
15707|"vein bringing it back, resembling exactly in structure the lungs and gills"|FALSE
15707|"above mentioned; and that the blood changes its colour from a dark to a"|FALSE
15707|"light red in passing through these vessels."|FALSE
15707|"This analogy between the lungs and gills of animals, and the placenta of"|FALSE
15707|"the fetus, extends through a great variety of other circumstances; thus"|FALSE
15707|"air-breathing creatures and fish can live but a few minutes without air or"|FALSE
15707|"water; or when they are confined in such air or water, as has been spoiled"|FALSE
15707|"by their own respiration; the same happens to the fetus, which, as soon as"|FALSE
15707|"the placenta is separated from the uterus, must either expand its lungs,"|FALSE
15707|"and receive air, or die. Hence from the structure, as well as the use of"|FALSE
15707|"the placenta, it appears to be a respiratory organ, like the gills of fish,"|FALSE
15707|"by which the blood in the fetus becomes oxygenated."|FALSE
15707|"From the terminations of the placental vessels not being observed to bleed"|FALSE
15707|"after being torn from the uterus, while those of the uterus effuse a great"|FALSE
15707|"quantity of florid arterial blood, the terminations of the placental"|FALSE
15707|"vessels would seem to be inserted into the arterial ones of the mother; and"|FALSE
15707|"to receive oxygenation from the passing currents of her blood through their"|FALSE
15707|"coats or membranes; which oxygenation is proved by the change of the colour"|FALSE
15707|"of the blood from dark to light red in its passage from the placental"|FALSE
15707|"arteries to the placental vein."|FALSE
15707|"The curious structure of the cavities or lacunæ of the placenta,"|FALSE
15707|"demonstrated by Mr. J. Hunter, explain this circumstance. That ingenious"|FALSE
15707|"philosopher has shewn, that there are numerous cavities of lacunæ formed on"|FALSE
15707|"that side of the placenta, which is in contact with the uterus; those"|FALSE
15707|"cavities or cells are filled with blood from the maternal arteries, which"|FALSE
15707|"open into them; which blood is again taken up by the maternal veins, and is"|FALSE
15707|"thus perpetually changed. While the terminations of the placental arteries"|FALSE
15707|"and veins are spread in fine reticulation on the sides of these cells. And"|FALSE
15707|"thus, as the growing fetus requires greater oxygenation, an apparatus is"|FALSE
15707|"produced resembling exactly the air-cells of the lungs."|FALSE
15707|"In cows, and other ruminating animals, the internal surface of the uterus"|FALSE
15707|"is unequal like hollow cups, which have been called cotyledons; and into"|FALSE
15707|"these cavities the prominencies of the numerous placentas, with which the"|FALSE
15707|"fetus of those animals is furnished, are inserted, and strictly adhere;"|FALSE
15707|"though they may be extracted without effusion of blood. These inequalities"|FALSE
15707|"of the uterus, and the numerous placentas in consequence, seem to be"|FALSE
15707|"designed for the purpose of expanding a greater surface for the"|FALSE
15707|"terminations of the placental vessels for the purpose of receiving"|FALSE
15707|"oxygenation from the uterine ones; as the progeny of this class of animals"|FALSE
15707|"are more completely formed before their nativity, than that of the"|FALSE
15707|"carnivorous classes, and must thence in the latter weeks of pregnancy"|FALSE
15707|"require greater oxygenation. Thus calves and lambs can walk about in a few"|FALSE
15707|"minutes after their birth; while puppies and kittens remain many days"|FALSE
15707|"without opening their eyes. And though on the separation of the cotyledons"|FALSE
15707|"of ruminating animals no blood is effused, yet this is owing clearly to the"|FALSE
15707|"greater power of contraction of their uterine lacunæ or alveoli. See"|FALSE
15707|"Medical Essays, Vol. V. page 144. And from the same cause they are not"|FALSE
15707|"liable to a sanguiferous menstruation."|FALSE
15707|"The necessity of the oxygenation of the blood in the fetus is farther"|FALSE
15707|"illustrated by the analogy of the chick in the egg; which appears to have"|FALSE
15707|"its blood oxygenated at the extremities of the vessels surrounding the"|FALSE
15707|"yolk; which are spread on the air-bag at the broad end of the egg, and may"|FALSE
15707|"absorb oxygene through that moist membrane from the air confined behind it;"|FALSE
15707|"and which is shewn by experiments in the exhausted receiver to be"|FALSE
15707|"changeable though the shell."|FALSE
15707|"This analogy may even be extended to the growing seeds of vegetables; which"|FALSE
15707|"were shewn by Mr. Scheele to require a renovation of the air over the"|FALSE
15707|"water, in which they were confined. Many vegetable seeds are surrounded"|FALSE
15707|"with air in their pods or receptacles, as peas, the fruit of staphylea, and"|FALSE
15707|"lichnis vesicaria; but it is probable, that those seeds, after they are"|FALSE
15707|"shed, as well as the spawn of fish, by the situation of the former on or"|FALSE
15707|"near the moist and aerated surface of the earth, and of the latter in the"|FALSE
15707|"ever-changing and ventilated water, may not be in need of an apparatus for"|FALSE
15707|"the oxygenation of their first blood, before the leaves of one, and the"|FALSE
15707|"gills of the other, are produced for this purpose."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. There are many arguments, besides the strict analogy between the"|FALSE
15707|"liquor amnii and the albumen ovi, which shew the former to be a nutritive"|FALSE
15707|"fluid; and that the fetus in the latter months of pregnancy takes it into"|FALSE
15707|"its stomach; and that in consequence the placenta is produced for some"|FALSE
15707|"other important purpose."|FALSE
15707|"First, that the liquor amnii is not an excrementitious fluid is evinced,"|FALSE
15707|"because it is found in greater quantity, when the fetus is young,"|FALSE
15707|"decreasing after a certain period till birth. Haller asserts, \"that in some"|FALSE
15707|"animals but a small quantity of this fluid remains at the birth. In the"|FALSE
15707|"eggs of hens it is consumed on the eighteenth day, so that at the exclusion"|FALSE
15707|"of the chick scarcely any remains. In rabbits before birth there is none.\""|FALSE
15707|"Elem. Physiol. Had this been an excrementitious fluid, the contrary would"|FALSE
15707|"probably have occurred. Secondly, the skin of the fetus is covered with a"|FALSE
15707|"whitish crust or pellicle, which would seem to preclude any idea of the"|FALSE
15707|"liquor amnii being produced by any exsudation of perspirable matter. And it"|FALSE
15707|"cannot consist of urine, because in brute animals the urachus passes from"|FALSE
15707|"the bladder to the alantois for the express purpose of carrying off that"|FALSE
15707|"fluid; which however in the human fetus seems to be retained in the"|FALSE
15707|"distended bladder, as the feces are accumulated in the bowels of all"|FALSE
15707|"animals."|FALSE
15707|"2. The nutritious quality of the liquid, which surrounds the fetus, appears"|FALSE
15707|"from the following considerations. 1. It is coagulable by heat, by nitrous"|FALSE
15707|"acid, and by spirit of wine, like milk, serum of blood, and other fluids,"|FALSE
15707|"which daily experience evinces to be nutritious. 2. It has a saltish taste"|FALSE
15707|"according to the accurate Baron Haller, not unlike the whey of milk, which"|FALSE
15707|"it even resembles in smell. 3. The white of the egg which constitutes the"|FALSE
15707|"food of the chick, is shewn to be nutritious by our daily experience;"|FALSE
15707|"besides the experiment of its nutritious effects mentioned by Dr. Fordyce"|FALSE
15707|"in his late Treatise on Digestion, p. 178; who adds, that it much resembles"|FALSE
15707|"the essential parts of the serum of blood."|FALSE
15707|"3. A fluid similar to the fluid, with which the fetus is surrounded, except"|FALSE
15707|"what little change may be produced by a beginning digestion, is found in"|FALSE
15707|"the stomach of the fetus; and the white of the egg is found, in the same"|FALSE
15707|"manner in the stomach of the chick."|FALSE
15707|"Numerous hairs, similar to those of its skin, are perpetually found among"|FALSE

15707|"A column of ice has been seen to reach down the oesophagus from the mouth"|FALSE
15707|"to the stomach in a frozen fetus; and this ice was the liquor amnii frozen."|FALSE
15707|"The meconium, or first fæces, in the bowels of new-born infants evince,"|FALSE
15707|"that something has been digested; and what could this be but the liquor"|FALSE
15707|"amnii together with the recrements of the gastric juice and gall, which"|FALSE
15707|"were necessary for its digestion?"|FALSE
15707|"There have been recorded some monstrous births of animals without heads,"|FALSE
15707|"and consequently without mouths, which seem to have been delivered on"|FALSE
15707|"doubtful authority, or from inaccurate observation. There are two of such"|FALSE
15707|"monstrous productions however better attested; one of a human fetus,"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned by Gipson in the Scots Medical Essays; which having the gula"|FALSE
15707|"impervious was furnished with an aperture into the wind-pipe, which"|FALSE
15707|"communicated below into the gullet; by means of which the liquor amnii"|FALSE
15707|"might be taken into the stomach before nativity without danger of"|FALSE
15707|"suffocation, while the fetus had no occasion to breathe. The other"|FALSE
15707|"monstrous fetus is described by Vander Wiel, who asserts, that he saw a"|FALSE
15707|"monstrous lamb, which had no mouth; but instead of it was furnished with an"|FALSE
15707|"opening in the lower part of the neck into the stomach. Both these"|FALSE
15707|"instances evidently favour the doctrine of the fetus being nourished by the"|FALSE
15707|"mouth; as otherwise there had been no necessity for new or unnatural"|FALSE
15707|"apertures into the stomach, when the natural ones were deficient?"|FALSE
15707|"From these facts and observations we may safely infer, that the fetus in"|FALSE
15707|"the womb is nourished by the fluid which surrounds it; which during the"|FALSE
15707|"first period of gestation is absorbed by the naked lacteals; and is"|FALSE
15707|"afterwards swallowed into the stomach and bowels, when these organs are"|FALSE
15707|"perfected; and lastly that the placenta is an organ for the purpose of"|FALSE
15707|"giving due oxygenation to the blood of the fetus; which is more necessary,"|FALSE
15707|"or at least more frequently necessary, than even the supply of food."|FALSE
15707|"The question of the great Harvey becomes thus easily answered. \"Why is not"|FALSE
15707|"the fetus in the womb suffocated for want of air, when it remains there"|FALSE
15707|"even to the tenth month without respiration: yet if it be born in the"|FALSE

15707|"some ounces of fluid collected in a thin pellicle or hydatide. This bag of"|FALSE
15707|"fluid compresses the optic nerve on one side, by which the vision being"|FALSE

15707|"is exchanged for milk after nativity. Haller. Physiol. V. 1. In the egg the"|FALSE
15707|"white part, which is analogous to the liquor amnii of quadrupeds, consists"|FALSE

15707|"analogous to this yolk is found in the fetus of lactiferous animals, as the"|FALSE
15707|"milk is another nutritive fluid ready prepared for the young progeny."|FALSE
15707|"The yolk therefore is not necessary to the spawn of fish, the eggs of"|FALSE
15707|"insects, or for the seeds of vegetables; as their embryons have probably"|FALSE
15707|"their food presented to them as soon as they are excluded from their"|FALSE
15707|"shells, or have extended their roots. Whence it happens that some insects"|FALSE
15707|"produce a living progeny in the spring and summer, and eggs in the autumn;"|FALSE
15707|"and some vegetables have living roots or buds produced in the place of"|FALSE
15707|"seeds, as the polygonum viviparum, and magical onions. See Botanic Garden,"|FALSE
15707|"p. 11. art. anthoxanthum."|FALSE
15707|"There seems however to be a reservoir of nutriment prepared for some seeds"|FALSE
15707|"besides their cotyledons or seed-leaves, which may be supposed in some"|FALSE
15707|"measure analogous to the yolk of the egg. Such are the saccharine juices of"|FALSE
15707|"apples, grapes and other fruits, which supply nutrition to the seeds after"|FALSE
15707|"they fall on the ground. And such is the milky juice in the centre of the"|FALSE
15707|"cocoa-nut, and part of the kernel of it; the same I suppose of all other"|FALSE
15707|"monocotyledon seeds, as of the palms, grasses, and lilies."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The process of generation is still involved in impenetrable"|FALSE
15707|"obscurity, conjectures may nevertheless be formed concerning some of its"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances. First, the eggs of fish and frogs are impregnated, after"|FALSE
15707|"they leave the body of the female; because they are deposited in a fluid,"|FALSE
15707|"and are not therefore covered with a hard shell. It is however remarkable,"|FALSE
15707|"that neither frogs nor fish will part with their spawn without the presence"|FALSE
15707|"of the male; on which account female carp and gold-fish in small ponds,"|FALSE
15707|"where there are no males, frequently die from the distention of their"|FALSE
15707|"growing spawn. 2. The eggs of fowls, which are laid without being"|FALSE
15707|"impregnated, are seen to contain only the yolk and white, which are"|FALSE
15707|"evidently the food or sustenance for the future chick. 3. As the"|FALSE
15707|"cicatricula of these eggs is given by the cock, and is evidently the"|FALSE
15707|"rudiment of the new animal; we may conclude, that the embryon is produced"|FALSE
15707|"by the male, and the proper food and nidus by the female. For if the female"|FALSE
15707|"be supposed to form an equal part of the embryon, why should she form the"|FALSE
15707|"whole of the apparatus for nutriment and for oxygenation? the male in many"|FALSE
15707|"animals is larger, stronger, and digests more food than the female, and"|FALSE
15707|"therefore should contribute as much or more towards the reproduction of the"|FALSE
15707|"species; but if he contributes only half the embryon and none of the"|FALSE
15707|"apparatus for sustenance and oxygenation, the division is unequal; the"|FALSE
15707|"strength of the male, and his consumption of food are too great for the"|FALSE
15707|"effect, compared with that of the female, which is contrary to the usual"|FALSE
15707|"course of nature."|FALSE
15707|"In objection to this theory of generation it may be said, if the animalcula"|FALSE
15707|"in femine, as seen by the microscope, be all of them rudiments of"|FALSE
15707|"homunculi, when but one of them can find a nidus, what a waste nature has"|FALSE
15707|"made of her productions? I do not assert that these moving particles,"|FALSE
15707|"visible by the microscope, are homunciones; perhaps they may be the"|FALSE
15707|"creatures of stagnation or putridity, or perhaps no creatures at all; but"|FALSE
15707|"if they are supposed to be rudiments of homunculi, or embryons, such a"|FALSE
15707|"profusion of them corresponds with the general efforts of nature to provide"|FALSE
15707|"for the continuance of her species of animals. Every individual tree"|FALSE
15707|"produces innumerable seeds, and every individual fish innumerable spawn, in"|FALSE
15707|"such inconceivable abundance as would in a short space of time crowd the"|FALSE
15707|"earth and ocean with inhabitants; and these are much more perfect animals"|FALSE
15707|"than the animalcula in femine can be supposed to be, and perish in"|FALSE
15707|"uncounted millions. This argument only shews, that the productions of"|FALSE
15707|"nature are governed by general laws; and that by a wise superfluity of"|FALSE
15707|"provision she has ensured their continuance."|FALSE
15707|"2. That the embryon is secreted or produced by the male, and not by the"|FALSE
15707|"conjunction of fluids from both male and female, appears from the analogy"|FALSE
15707|"of vegetable seeds. In the large flowers, as the tulip, there is no"|FALSE
15707|"similarity of apparatus between the anthers and the stigma: the seed is"|FALSE
15707|"produced according to the observations of Spallanzani long before the"|FALSE
15707|"flowers open, and in consequence long before it can be impregnated, like"|FALSE
15707|"the egg in the pullet. And after the prolific dust is shed on the stigma,"|FALSE
15707|"the seed becomes coagulated in one point first, like the cicatricula of the"|FALSE
15707|"impregnated egg. See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note 38. Now in"|FALSE
15707|"these simple products of nature, if the female contributed to produce the"|FALSE
15707|"new embryon equally with the male, there would probably have been some"|FALSE
15707|"visible similarity of parts for this purpose, besides those necessary for"|FALSE
15707|"the nidus and sustenance of the new progeny. Besides in many flowers the"|FALSE
15707|"males are more numerous than the females, or than the separate uterine"|FALSE
15707|"cells in their germs, which would shew, that the office of the male was at"|FALSE
15707|"least as important as that of the female; whereas if the female, besides"|FALSE
15707|"producing the egg or seed, was to produce an equal part of the embryon, the"|FALSE
15707|"office of reproduction would be unequally divided between them."|FALSE
15707|"Add to this, that in the most simple kind of vegetable reproduction, I mean"|FALSE
15707|"the buds of trees, which are their viviparous offspring, the leaf is"|FALSE
15707|"evidently the parent of the bud, which rises in its bosom, according to the"|FALSE
15707|"observation of Linnaeus. This leaf consists of absorbent vessels, and"|FALSE
15707|"pulmonary ones, to obtain its nutriment, and to impregnate it with oxygene."|FALSE
15707|"This simple piece of living organization is also furnished with a power of"|FALSE
15707|"reproduction; and as the new offspring is thus supported adhering to its"|FALSE
15707|"father, it needs no mother to supply it with a nidus, and nutriment, and"|FALSE
15707|"oxygenation; and hence no female leaf has existence."|FALSE
15707|"I conceive that the vessels between the bud and the leaf communicate or"|FALSE
15707|"inosculate; and that the bud is thus served with vegetable blood, that is,"|FALSE
15707|"with both nutriment and oxygenation, till the death of the parent-leaf in"|FALSE
15707|"autumn. And in this respect it differs from the fetus of viviparous"|FALSE
15707|"animals. Secondly, that then the bark-vessels belonging to the dead-leaf,"|FALSE
15707|"and in which I suppose a kind of manna to have been deposited, become now"|FALSE
15707|"the placental vessels, if they may be so called, of the new bud. From the"|FALSE
15707|"vernal sap thus produced of one sugar-maple-tree in New-York and in"|FALSE
15707|"Pennsylvania, five or six pounds of good sugar may be made annually without"|FALSE
15707|"destroying the tree. Account of maple-sugar by B. Rushes. London, Phillips."|FALSE
15707|"(See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note on vegetable placentation.)"|FALSE
15707|"These vessels, when the warmth of the vernal sun hatches the young bud,"|FALSE
15707|"serve it with a saccharine nutriment, till it acquires leaves of its own,"|FALSE
15707|"and shoots a new system of absorbents down the bark and root of the tree,"|FALSE
15707|"just as the farinaceous or oily matter in seeds, and the saccharine matter"|FALSE
15707|"in fruits, serve their embryons with nutriment, till they acquire leaves"|FALSE
15707|"and roots. This analogy is as forceable in so obscure a subject, as it is"|FALSE
15707|"curious, and may in large buds, as of the horse-chesnut, be almost seen by"|FALSE
15707|"the naked eye; if with a penknife the remaining rudiment of the last year's"|FALSE
15707|"leaf, and of the new bud in its bosom, be cut away slice by slice. The"|FALSE
15707|"seven ribs of the last year's leaf will be seen to have arisen from the"|FALSE
15707|"pith in seven distinct points making a curve; and the new bud to have been"|FALSE
15707|"produced in their centre, and to have pierced the alburnum and cortex, and"|FALSE
15707|"grown without the assistance of a mother. A similar process may be seen on"|FALSE
15707|"dissecting a tulip-root in winter; the leaves, which inclosed the last"|FALSE
15707|"year's flower-stalk, were not necessary for the flower; but each of these"|FALSE
15707|"was the father of a new bud, which may be now found at its base; and which,"|FALSE
15707|"as it adheres to the parent, required no mother."|FALSE
15707|"This paternal offspring of vegetables, I mean their buds and bulbs, is"|FALSE
15707|"attended with a very curious circumstance; and that is, that they exactly"|FALSE
15707|"resemble their parents, as is observable in grafting fruit-trees, and in"|FALSE
15707|"propagating flower-roots; whereas the seminal offspring of plants, being"|FALSE
15707|"supplied with nutriment by the mother, is liable to perpetual variation."|FALSE
15707|"Thus also in the vegetable class dioicia, where the male flowers are"|FALSE
15707|"produced on one tree, and the female ones on another; the buds of the male"|FALSE
15707|"trees uniformly produce either male flowers, or other buds similar to"|FALSE
15707|"themselves; and the buds of the female trees produce either female flowers,"|FALSE
15707|"or other buds similar to themselves; whereas the seeds of these trees"|FALSE
15707|"produce either male or female plants. From this analogy of the production"|FALSE
15707|"of vegetable buds without a mother, I contend that the mother does not"|FALSE
15707|"contribute to the formation of the living ens in animal generation, but is"|FALSE
15707|"necessary only for supplying its nutriment and oxygenation."|FALSE
15707|"There is another vegetable fact published by M. Koelreuter, which he calls"|FALSE
15707|"\"a complete metamorphosis of one natural species of plants into another,\""|FALSE
15707|"which shews, that in seeds as well as in buds, the embryon proceeds from"|FALSE
15707|"the male parent, though the form of the subsequent mature plant is in part"|FALSE
15707|"dependant on the female. M. Koelreuter impregnated a stigma of the"|FALSE
15707|"nicotiana rustica with the farina of the nicotiana paniculata, and obtained"|FALSE
15707|"prolific seeds from it. With the plants which sprung from these seeds, he"|FALSE
15707|"repeated the experiment, impregnating them with the farina of the nicotiana"|FALSE
15707|"paniculata. As the mule plants which he thus produced were prolific, he"|FALSE
15707|"continued to impregnate them for many generations with the farina of the"|FALSE
15707|"nicotiana paniculata, and they became more and more like the male parent,"|FALSE
15707|"till he at length obtained six plants in every respect perfectly similar to"|FALSE
15707|"the nicotiana paniculata; and in no respect resembling their female parent"|FALSE
15707|"the nicotiana rustica. _Blumenbach_ on Generation."|FALSE
15707|"3. It is probable that the insects, which are said to require but one"|FALSE
15707|"impregnation for six generations, as the aphis (see Amenit. Academ.)"|FALSE
15707|"produce their progeny in the manner above described, that is, without a"|FALSE
15707|"mother, and not without a father; and thus experience a lucina sine"|FALSE
15707|"concubitu. Those who have attended to the habits of the polypus, which is"|FALSE
15707|"found in the stagnant water of our ditches in July, affirm, that the young"|FALSE
15707|"ones branch out from the side of the parent like the buds of trees, and"|FALSE
15707|"after a time separate themselves from them. This is so analogous to the"|FALSE
15707|"manner in which the buds of trees appear to be produced, that these polypi"|FALSE
15707|"may be considered as all male animals, producing embryons, which require no"|FALSE
15707|"mother to supply them with a nidus, or with nutriment, and oxygenation."|FALSE
15707|"This lateral or lineal generation of plants, not only obtains in the buds"|FALSE
15707|"of trees, which continue to adhere to them, but is beautifully seen in the"|FALSE
15707|"wires of knot-grass, polygonum aviculare, and in those of strawberries,"|FALSE

15707|"of animals is formed by the male-parent, and not by the mother, as one"|FALSE

15707|"This idea of the reproduction of animals from a single living filament of"|FALSE

15707|"From all these analogies I conclude, that the embryon is produced solely by"|FALSE

15707|"into life, (as held by some philosophers) has no support from experiment or"|FALSE
15707|"analogy."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Many ingenious philosophers have found so great difficulty in"|FALSE
15707|"conceiving the manner of the reproduction of animals, that they have"|FALSE
15707|"supposed all the numerous progeny, to have existed in miniature in the"|FALSE
15707|"animal originally created; and that these infinitely minute forms are only"|FALSE
15707|"evolved or distended, as the embryon increases in the womb. This idea,"|FALSE
15707|"besides its being unsupported by any analogy we are acquainted with,"|FALSE
15707|"ascribes a greater tenuity to organized matter, than we can readily admit;"|FALSE
15707|"as these included embryons are supposed each of them to consist of the"|FALSE
15707|"various and complicate parts of animal bodies: they must possess a much"|FALSE
15707|"greater degree of minuteness, than that which was ascribed to the devils"|FALSE
15707|"that tempted St. Anthony; of whom 20,000 were said to have been able to"|FALSE
15707|"dance a saraband on the point of the finest needle without incommoding each"|FALSE
15707|"other."|FALSE
15707|"2. Others have supposed, that all the parts of the embryon are formed in"|FALSE
15707|"the male, previous to its being deposited in the egg or uterus; and that it"|FALSE
15707|"is then only to have its parts evolved or distended as mentioned above; but"|FALSE
15707|"this is only to get rid of one difficulty by proposing another equally"|FALSE
15707|"incomprehensible: they found it difficult to conceive, how the embryon"|FALSE
15707|"could be formed in the uterus or egg, and therefore wished it to be formed"|FALSE
15707|"before it came thither. In answer to both these doctrines it may be"|FALSE
15707|"observed, 1st, that some animals, as the crab-fish, can reproduce a whole"|FALSE
15707|"limb, as a leg which has been broken off; others, as worms and snails, can"|FALSE
15707|"reproduce a head, or a tail, when either of them has been cut away; and"|FALSE
15707|"that hence in these animals at least a part can be formed anew, which"|FALSE
15707|"cannot be supposed to have existed previously in miniature."|FALSE
15707|"Secondly, there are new parts or new vessels produced in many diseases, as"|FALSE
15707|"on the cornea of the eye in ophthalmy, in wens and cancers, which cannot be"|FALSE
15707|"supposed to have had a prototype or original miniature in the embryon."|FALSE
15707|"Thirdly, how could mule-animals be produced, which partake of the forms of"|FALSE
15707|"both the parents, if the original embryon was a miniature existing in the"|FALSE
15707|"semen of the male parent? if an embryon of the male ass was only expanded,"|FALSE
15707|"no resemblance to the mare could exist in the mule."|FALSE
15707|"This mistaken idea of the extension of parts seems to have had its rise"|FALSE
15707|"from the mature man resembling the general form of the fetus; and from"|FALSE
15707|"thence it was believed, that the parts of the fetus were distended into the"|FALSE
15707|"man; whereas they have increased 100 times in weight, as well as 100 times"|FALSE
15707|"in size; now no one will call the additional 99 parts a distention of the"|FALSE
15707|"original one part in respect to weight. Thus the uterus during pregnancy is"|FALSE
15707|"greatly enlarged in thickness and solidity as well as in capacity, and"|FALSE
15707|"hence must have acquired this additional size by accretion of new parts,"|FALSE
15707|"not by an extension of the old ones; the familiar act of blowing up the"|FALSE
15707|"bladder of an animal recently slaughtered has led our imaginations to apply"|FALSE
15707|"this idea of distention to the increase of size from natural growth; which"|FALSE
15707|"however must be owing to the apposition of new parts; as it is evinced from"|FALSE
15707|"the increase of weight along with the increase of dimension; and is even"|FALSE
15707|"visible to our eyes in the elongation of our hair from the colour of its"|FALSE
15707|"ends; or when it has been dyed on the head; and in the growth of our nails"|FALSE
15707|"from the specks sometimes observable on them; and in the increase of the"|FALSE
15707|"white crescent at their roots, and in the growth of new flesh in wounds,"|FALSE
15707|"which consists of new nerves as well as of new blood-vessels."|FALSE
15707|"3. Lastly, Mr. Buffon has with great ingenuity imagined the existence of"|FALSE
15707|"certain organic particles, which are supposed to be partly alive, and"|FALSE
15707|"partly mechanic springs. The latter of these were discovered by Mr. Needham"|FALSE
15707|"in the milt or male organ of a species of cuttle fish, called calmar; the"|FALSE
15707|"former, or living animalcula, are found in both male and female secretions,"|FALSE
15707|"in the infusions of seeds, as of pepper, in the jelly of roasted veal, and"|FALSE
15707|"in all other animal and vegetable substances. These organic particles he"|FALSE
15707|"supposes to exist in the spermatic fluids of both sexes, and that they are"|FALSE
15707|"derived thither from every part of the body, and must therefore resemble,"|FALSE
15707|"as he supposes, the parts from whence they are derived. These organic"|FALSE
15707|"particles he believes to be in constant activity, till they become mixed in"|FALSE
15707|"the womb, and then they instantly join and produce an embryon or fetus"|FALSE
15707|"similar to the two parents."|FALSE
15707|"Many objections might be adduced to this fanciful theory, I shall only"|FALSE
15707|"mention two. First, that it is analogous to no known animal laws. And"|FALSE
15707|"secondly, that as these fluids, replete with organic particles derived both"|FALSE
15707|"from the male and female organs, are supposed to be similar; there is no"|FALSE
15707|"reason why the mother should not produce a female embryon without the"|FALSE
15707|"assistance of the male, and realize the lucina sine concubitu."|FALSE
15707|"IV. 1. I conceive the primordium, or rudiment of the embryon, as secreted"|FALSE
15707|"from the blood of the parent, to consist of a simple living filament as a"|FALSE
15707|"muscular fibre; which I suppose to be an extremity of a nerve of"|FALSE
15707|"loco-motion, as a fibre of the retina is an extremity of a nerve of"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; as for instance one of the fibrils, which compose the mouth of"|FALSE
15707|"an absorbent vessel; I suppose this living filament, of whatever form it"|FALSE
15707|"may be, whether sphere, cube, or cylinder, to be endued with the capability"|FALSE
15707|"of being excited into action by certain kinds of stimulus. By the stimulus"|FALSE
15707|"of the surrounding fluid, in which it is received from the male, it may"|FALSE
15707|"bend into a ring; and thus form the beginning of a tube. Such moving"|FALSE
15707|"filaments, and such rings, are described by those, who have attended to"|FALSE
15707|"microscopic animalcula. This living ring may now embrace or absorb a"|FALSE
15707|"nutritive particle of the fluid, in which it swims; and by drawing it into"|FALSE
15707|"its pores, or joining it by compression to its extremities, may increase"|FALSE
15707|"its own length or crassitude; and by degrees the living ring may become a"|FALSE
15707|"living tube."|FALSE
15707|"2. With this new organization, or accretion of parts, new kinds of"|FALSE
15707|"irritability may commence; for so long as there was but one living organ,"|FALSE
15707|"it could only be supposed to possess irritability; since sensibility may be"|FALSE
15707|"conceived to be an extension of the effect of irritability over the rest of"|FALSE
15707|"the system. These new kinds of irritability and of sensibility in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of new organization, appear from variety of facts in the more"|FALSE
15707|"mature animal; thus the formation of the testes, and consequent secretion"|FALSE
15707|"of the semen, occasion the passion of lust; the lungs must be previously"|FALSE
15707|"formed before their exertions to obtain fresh air can exist; the throat or"|FALSE
15707|"oesophagus must be formed previous to the sensation or appetites of hunger"|FALSE
15707|"and thirst; one of which seems to reside at the upper end, and the other at"|FALSE
15707|"the lower end of that canal."|FALSE
15707|"Thus also the glans penis, when it is distended with blood, acquires a new"|FALSE
15707|"sensibility, and a new appetency. The same occurs to the nipples of the"|FALSE
15707|"breasts of female animals, when they are distended with blood, they acquire"|FALSE
15707|"the new appetency of giving milk. So inflamed tendons and membranes, and"|FALSE
15707|"even bones, acquire new sensations; and the parts of mutilated animals, as"|FALSE
15707|"of wounded snails, and polypi, and crabs, are reproduced; and at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time acquire sensations adapted to their situations. Thus when the head of"|FALSE
15707|"a snail is reproduced after decollation with a sharp rasor, those curious"|FALSE
15707|"telescopic eyes are also reproduced, and acquire their sensibility to"|FALSE
15707|"light, as well as their adapted muscles for retraction on the approach of"|FALSE
15707|"injury."|FALSE
15707|"With every new change, therefore, of organic form, or addition of organic"|FALSE
15707|"parts, I suppose a new kind of irritability or of sensibility to be"|FALSE
15707|"produced; such varieties of irritability or of sensibility exist in our"|FALSE
15707|"adult state in the glands; every one of which is furnished with an"|FALSE
15707|"irritability, or a taste, or appetency, and a consequent mode of action"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar to itself."|FALSE
15707|"In this manner I conceive the vessels of the jaws to produce those of the"|FALSE
15707|"teeth, those of the fingers to produce the nails, those of the skin to"|FALSE
15707|"produce the hair; in the same manner as afterwards about the age of puberty"|FALSE
15707|"the beard and other great changes in the form of the body, and disposition"|FALSE
15707|"of the mind, are produced in consequence of the new secretion of semen; for"|FALSE
15707|"if the animal is deprived of this secretion those changes do not take"|FALSE
15707|"place. These changes I conceive to be formed not by elongation or"|FALSE
15707|"distention of primeval stamina, but by apposition of parts; as the mature"|FALSE
15707|"crab-fish, when deprived of a limb, in a certain space of time has power to"|FALSE
15707|"regenerate it; and the tadpole puts forth its feet long after its exclusion"|FALSE
15707|"from the spawn; and the caterpillar in changing into a butterfly acquires a"|FALSE
15707|"new form, with new powers, new sensations, and new desires."|FALSE
15707|"The natural history of butterflies, and moths, and beetles, and gnats, is"|FALSE
15707|"full of curiosity; some of them pass many months, and others even years, in"|FALSE
15707|"their caterpillar or grub state; they then rest many weeks without food,"|FALSE
15707|"suspended in the air, buried in the earth, or submersed in water; and"|FALSE
15707|"change themselves during this time into an animal apparently of a different"|FALSE
15707|"nature; the stomachs of some of them, which before digested vegetable"|FALSE
15707|"leaves or roots, now only digest honey; they have acquired wings for the"|FALSE
15707|"purpose of seeking this new food, and a long proboscis to collect it from"|FALSE
15707|"flowers, and I suppose a sense of smell to detect the secret places in"|FALSE
15707|"flowers, where it is formed. The moths, which fly by night, have a much"|FALSE
15707|"longer proboscis rolled up under their chins like a watch spring; which"|FALSE
15707|"they extend to collect the honey from flowers in their sleeping state; when"|FALSE
15707|"they are closed, and the nectaries in consequence more difficult to be"|FALSE
15707|"plundered. The beetle kind are furnished with an external covering of a"|FALSE
15707|"hard material to their wings, that they may occasionally again make holes"|FALSE
15707|"in the earth, in which they passed the former state of their existence."|FALSE
15707|"But what most of all distinguishes these new animals is, that they are new"|FALSE
15707|"furnished with the powers of reproduction; and that they now differ from"|FALSE
15707|"each other in sex, which does not appear in their caterpillar or grub"|FALSE
15707|"state. In some of them the change from a caterpillar into a butterfly or"|FALSE
15707|"moth seems to be accomplished for the sole purpose of their propagation;"|FALSE
15707|"since they immediately die after this is finished, and take no food in the"|FALSE
15707|"interim, as the silk-worm in this climate; though it is possible, it might"|FALSE
15707|"take honey as food, if it was presented to it. For in general it would"|FALSE
15707|"seem, that food of a more stimulating kind, the honey of vegetables instead"|FALSE
15707|"of their leaves, was necessary for the purpose of the seminal reproduction"|FALSE
15707|"of these animals, exactly similar to what happens in vegetables; in these"|FALSE
15707|"the juices of the earth are sufficient for their purpose of reproduction by"|FALSE
15707|"buds or bulbs; in which the new plant seems to be formed by irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions, like the growth of their other parts, as their leaves or roots;"|FALSE
15707|"but for the purpose of seminal or amatorial reproduction, where sensation"|FALSE
15707|"is required, a more stimulating food becomes necessary for the anther, and"|FALSE
15707|"stigma; and this food is honey; as explained in Sect. XIII. on Vegetable"|FALSE
15707|"Animation."|FALSE
15707|"The gnat and the tadpole resemble each other in their change from natant"|FALSE
15707|"animals with gills into aerial animals with lungs; and in their change of"|FALSE
15707|"the element in which they live; and probably of the food, with which they"|FALSE
15707|"are supported; and lastly, with their acquiring in their new state the"|FALSE
15707|"difference of sex, and the organs of seminal or amatorial reproduction."|FALSE
15707|"While the polypus, who is their companion in their former state of life,"|FALSE
15707|"not being allowed to change his form and element, can only propagate like"|FALSE
15707|"vegetable buds by the same kind of irritative motions, which produces the"|FALSE
15707|"growth of his own body, without the seminal or amatorial propagation, which"|FALSE
15707|"requires sensation; and which in gnats and tadpoles seems to require a"|FALSE
15707|"change both of food and of respiration."|FALSE
15707|"From hence I conclude, that with the acquisition of new parts, new"|FALSE
15707|"sensations, and new desires, as well as new powers, are produced; and this"|FALSE
15707|"by accretion to the old ones, and not by distention of them. And finally,"|FALSE
15707|"that the most essential parts of the system, as the brain for the purpose"|FALSE
15707|"of distributing the power of life, and the placenta for the purpose of"|FALSE
15707|"oxygenating the blood, and the additional absorbent vessels for the purpose"|FALSE
15707|"of acquiring aliment, are first formed by the irritations above mentioned,"|FALSE
15707|"and by the pleasurable sensations attending those irritations, and by the"|FALSE
15707|"exertions in consequence of painful sensations, similar to those of hunger"|FALSE
15707|"and suffocation. After these an apparatus of limbs for future uses, or for"|FALSE
15707|"the purpose of moving the body in its present natant state, and of lungs"|FALSE
15707|"for future respiration, and of testes for future reproduction, are formed"|FALSE
15707|"by the irritations and sensations, and consequent exertions of the parts"|FALSE
15707|"previously existing, and to which the new parts are to be attached."|FALSE
15707|"3. In confirmation of these ideas it may be observed, that all the parts of"|FALSE
15707|"the body endeavour to grow, or to make additional parts to themselves"|FALSE
15707|"throughout our lives; but are restrained by the parts immediately"|FALSE
15707|"containing them; thus, if the skin be taken away, the fleshy parts beneath"|FALSE
15707|"soon shoot out new granulations, called by the vulgar proud flesh. If the"|FALSE
15707|"periosteum be removed, a similar growth commences from the bone. Now in the"|FALSE
15707|"case of the imperfect embryon, the containing or confining parts are not"|FALSE
15707|"yet supposed to be formed, and hence there is nothing to restrain its"|FALSE
15707|"growth."|FALSE
15707|"4. By the parts of the embryon being thus produced by new apportions, many"|FALSE
15707|"phenomena both of animal and vegetable productions receive an easier"|FALSE
15707|"explanation; such as that many fetuses are deficient at the extremities, as"|FALSE
15707|"in a finger or a toe, or in the end of the tongue, or in what is called a"|FALSE
15707|"hare-lip with deficiency of the palate. For if there should be a deficiency"|FALSE
15707|"in the quantity of the first nutritive particles laid up in the egg for the"|FALSE
15707|"reception of the first living filament, the extreme parts, as being last"|FALSE
15707|"formed, must shew this deficiency by their being imperfect."|FALSE
15707|"This idea of the growth of the embryon accords also with the production of"|FALSE
15707|"some monstrous births, which consist of a duplicature of the limbs, as"|FALSE
15707|"chickens with four legs; which could not occur, if the fetus was formed by"|FALSE
15707|"the distention of an original stamen, or miniature. For if there should be"|FALSE
15707|"a superfluity of the first nutritive particles laid up in the egg for the"|FALSE
15707|"first living filament; it is easy to conceive, that a duplicature of some"|FALSE
15707|"parts may be formed. And that such superfluous nourishment sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"exists, is evinced by the double yolks in some eggs, which I suppose were"|FALSE
15707|"thus formed previous to their impregnation by the exuberant nutriment of"|FALSE
15707|"the hen."|FALSE
15707|"This idea is confirmed by the analogy of the monsters in the vegetable"|FALSE
15707|"world also; in which a duplicate or triplicate production of various parts"|FALSE
15707|"of the flower is observable, as a triple nectary in some columbines, and a"|FALSE
15707|"triple petal in some primroses; and which are supposed to be produced by"|FALSE
15707|"abundant nourishment."|FALSE
15707|"5. If the embryon be received into a fluid, whose stimulus is different in"|FALSE
15707|"some degree from the natural, as in the production of mule-animals, the new"|FALSE
15707|"irritabilities or sensibilities acquired by the increasing or growing"|FALSE
15707|"organized parts may differ, and thence produce parts not similar to the"|FALSE
15707|"father, but of a kind belonging in part to the mother; and thus, though the"|FALSE
15707|"original stamen or living ens was derived totally from the father, yet new"|FALSE
15707|"irritabilities or sensibilities being excited, a change of form"|FALSE
15707|"corresponding with them will be produced. Nor could the production of mules"|FALSE
15707|"exist, if the stamen or miniature of all the parts of the embryon is"|FALSE
15707|"previously formed in the male semen, and is only distended by nourishment"|FALSE
15707|"in the female uterus. Whereas this difficulty ceases, if the embryon be"|FALSE
15707|"supposed to consist of a living filament, which acquires or makes new parts"|FALSE
15707|"with new irritabilities, as it advances in its growth."|FALSE
15707|"The form, solidity, and colour, of the particles of nutriment laid up for"|FALSE
15707|"the reception of the first living filament, as well as their peculiar kind"|FALSE
15707|"of stimulus, may contribute to produce a difference in the form, solidity,"|FALSE
15707|"and colour of the fetus, so as to resemble the mother, as it advances in"|FALSE
15707|"life. This also may especially happen during the first state of the"|FALSE
15707|"existence of the embryon, before it has acquired organs, which can change"|FALSE
15707|"these first nutritive particles, as explained in No. 5. 2. of this Section."|FALSE
15707|"And as these nutritive particles are supposed to be similar to those, which"|FALSE
15707|"are formed for her own nutrition, it follows that the fetus should so far"|FALSE
15707|"resemble the mother."|FALSE
15707|"This explains, why hereditary diseases may be derived either from the male"|FALSE
15707|"or female parent, as well as the peculiar form of either of their bodies."|FALSE
15707|"Some of these hereditary diseases are simply owing to a deficient activity"|FALSE
15707|"of a part of the system, as of the absorbent vessels, which open into the"|FALSE
15707|"cells or cavities of the body, and thus occasion dropsies. Others are at"|FALSE
15707|"the same time owing to an increase of sensation, as in scrophula and"|FALSE
15707|"consumption; in these the obstruction of the fluids is first caused by the"|FALSE
15707|"inirritability of the vessels, and the inflammation and ulcers which"|FALSE
15707|"succeed, are caused by the consequent increase of sensation in the"|FALSE
15707|"obstructed part. Other hereditary diseases, as the epilepsy, and other"|FALSE
15707|"convulsions, consist in too great voluntary exertions in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"disagreeable sensation in some particular diseased part. Now as the pains,"|FALSE
15707|"which occasion these convulsions, are owing to defect of the action of the"|FALSE
15707|"diseased part, as shewn in Sect. XXXIV. it is plain, that all these"|FALSE
15707|"hereditary diseases may have their origin either from defective"|FALSE
15707|"irritability derived from the father, or from deficiency of the stimulus of"|FALSE
15707|"the nutriment derived from the mother. In either case the effect would be"|FALSE
15707|"similar; as a scrophulous race is frequently produced among the poor from"|FALSE
15707|"the deficient stimulus of bad diet, or of hunger; and among the rich, by a"|FALSE
15707|"deficient irritability from their having been long accustomed to too great"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus, as of vinous spirit."|FALSE
15707|"6. From this account of reproduction it appears, that all animals have a"|FALSE
15707|"similar origin, viz. from a single living filament; and that the difference"|FALSE
15707|"of their forms and qualities has arisen only from the different"|FALSE
15707|"irritabilities and sensibilities, or voluntarities, or associabilities, of"|FALSE
15707|"this original living filament; and perhaps in some degree from the"|FALSE
15707|"different forms of the particles of the fluids, by which it has been at"|FALSE
15707|"first stimulated into activity. And that from hence, as Linnæus has"|FALSE
15707|"conjectured in respect to the vegetable world, it is not impossible, but"|FALSE
15707|"the great variety of species of animals, which now tenant the earth, may"|FALSE
15707|"have had their origin from the mixture of a few natural orders. And that"|FALSE
15707|"those animal and vegetable mules, which could continue their species, have"|FALSE
15707|"done so, and constitute the numerous families of animals and vegetables"|FALSE
15707|"which now exist; and that those mules, which were produced with imperfect"|FALSE
15707|"organs of generation, perished without reproduction, according to the"|FALSE
15707|"observation of Aristotle; and are the animals, which we now call mules. See"|FALSE
15707|"Botanic Garden, Part II. Note on Dianthus."|FALSE
15707|"Such a promiscuous intercourse of animals is said to exist at this day in"|FALSE
15707|"New South Wales by Captain Hunter. And that not only amongst the quadrupeds"|FALSE
15707|"and birds of different kinds, but even amongst the fish, and, as he"|FALSE
15707|"believes, amongst the vegetables. He speaks of an animal between the"|FALSE
15707|"opossum and the kangaroo, from the size of a sheep to that of a rat. Many"|FALSE

15707|"organization, originating from a single living filament, endued indeed with"|FALSE
15707|"different kinds of irritabilities and sensibilities, or of animal"|FALSE
15707|"appetencies; which exist in every gland, and in every moving organ of the"|FALSE
15707|"body, and are as essential to living organization as chemical affinities"|FALSE
15707|"are to certain combinations of inanimate matter."|FALSE
15707|"If I might be indulged to make a simile in a philosophical work, I should"|FALSE
15707|"say, that the animal appetencies are not only perhaps less numerous"|FALSE
15707|"originally than the chemical affinities; but that like these latter, they"|FALSE
15707|"change with every new combination; thus vital air and azote, when combined,"|FALSE
15707|"produce nitrous acid; which now acquires the property of dissolving silver;"|FALSE
15707|"so with every new additional part to the embryon, as of the throat or"|FALSE
15707|"lungs, I suppose a new animal appetency to be produced."|FALSE
15707|"In this early formation of the embryon from the irritabilities,"|FALSE
15707|"sensibilities, and associabilities, and consequent appetencies, the faculty"|FALSE
15707|"of volition can scarcely be supposed to have had its birth. For about what"|FALSE
15707|"can the fetus deliberate, when it has no choice of objects? But in the more"|FALSE
15707|"advanced state of the fetus, it evidently possesses volition; as it"|FALSE
15707|"frequently changes its attitude, though it seems to sleep the greatest part"|FALSE
15707|"of its time; and afterwards the power of volition contributes to change or"|FALSE
15707|"alter many parts of the body during its growth to manhood, by our early"|FALSE
15707|"modes of exertion in the various departments of life. All these faculties"|FALSE
15707|"then constitute the vis fabricatrix, and the vis conservatrix, as well as"|FALSE
15707|"the vis medicatrix of nature, so much spoken of, but so little understood"|FALSE
15707|"by philosophers."|FALSE
15707|"8. When we revolve in our minds, first, the great changes, which we see"|FALSE
15707|"naturally produced in animals after their nativity, as in the production of"|FALSE
15707|"the butterfly with painted wings from the crawling caterpillar; or of the"|FALSE
15707|"respiring frog from the subnatant tadpole; from the feminine boy to the"|FALSE
15707|"bearded man, and from the infant girl to the lactescent woman; both which"|FALSE
15707|"changes may be prevented by certain mutilations of the glands necessary to"|FALSE
15707|"reproduction."|FALSE
15707|"Secondly, when we think over the great changes introduced into various"|FALSE
15707|"animals by artificial or accidental cultivation, as in horses, which we"|FALSE
15707|"have exercised for the different purposes of strength or swiftness, in"|FALSE
15707|"carrying burthens or in running races; or in dogs, which have been"|FALSE
15707|"cultivated for strength and courage, as the bull-dog; or for acuteness of"|FALSE
15707|"his sense or smell, as the hound and spaniel; or for the swiftness of his"|FALSE
15707|"foot, as the greyhound; or for his swimming in the water, or for drawing"|FALSE
15707|"snow-sledges, as the rough-haired dogs of the north; or lastly, as a"|FALSE
15707|"play-dog for children, as the lap-dog; with the changes of the forms of the"|FALSE
15707|"cattle, which have been domesticated from the greatest antiquity, as"|FALSE
15707|"camels, and sheep; which have undergone so total a transformation, that we"|FALSE
15707|"are now ignorant from what species of wild animals they had their origin."|FALSE
15707|"Add to these the great changes of shape and colour, which we daily see"|FALSE
15707|"produced in smaller animals from our domestication of them, as rabbits, or"|FALSE
15707|"pigeons; or from the difference of climates and even of seasons; thus the"|FALSE
15707|"sheep of warm climates are covered with hair instead of wool; and the hares"|FALSE
15707|"and partridges of the latitudes, which are long buried in snow, become"|FALSE
15707|"white during the winter months; add to these the various changes produced"|FALSE
15707|"in the forms of mankind, by their early modes of exertion; or by the"|FALSE
15707|"diseases occasioned by their habits of life; both of which became"|FALSE
15707|"hereditary, and that through many generations. Those who labour at the"|FALSE
15707|"anvil, the oar, or the loom, as well as those who carry sedan-chairs, or"|FALSE
15707|"who have been educated to dance upon the rope, are distinguishable by the"|FALSE
15707|"shape of their limbs; and the diseases occasioned by intoxication deform"|FALSE
15707|"the countenance with leprous eruptions, or the body with tumid viscera, or"|FALSE
15707|"the joints with knots and distortions."|FALSE
15707|"Thirdly, when we enumerate the great changes produced in the species of"|FALSE
15707|"animals before their nativity; these are such as resemble the form or"|FALSE
15707|"colour of their parents, which have been altered by the cultivation or"|FALSE
15707|"accidents above related, and are thus continued to their posterity. Or they"|FALSE
15707|"are changes produced by the mixture of species as in mules; or changes"|FALSE
15707|"produced probably by the exuberance of nourishment supplied to the fetus,"|FALSE
15707|"as in monstrous births with additional limbs; many of these enormities of"|FALSE
15707|"shape are propagated, and continued as a variety at least, if not as a new"|FALSE
15707|"species of animal. I have seen a breed of cats with an additional claw on"|FALSE
15707|"every foot; of poultry also with an additional claw, and with wings to"|FALSE
15707|"their feet; and of others without rumps. Mr. Buffon mentions a breed of"|FALSE
15707|"dogs without tails, which are common at Rome and at Naples, which he"|FALSE
15707|"supposes to have been produced by a custom long established of cutting"|FALSE
15707|"their tails close off. There are many kinds of pigeons, admired for their"|FALSE
15707|"peculiarities, which are monsters thus produced and propagated. And to"|FALSE
15707|"these must be added, the changes produced by the imagination of the male"|FALSE
15707|"parent, as will be treated of more at large in No. VI. of this Section."|FALSE
15707|"When we consider all these changes of animal form, and innumerable others,"|FALSE
15707|"which may be collected from the books of natural history; we cannot but be"|FALSE
15707|"convinced, that the fetus or embryon is formed by apposition of new parts,"|FALSE
15707|"and not by the distention of a primordial nest of germs, included one"|FALSE
15707|"within another, like the cups of a conjurer."|FALSE
15707|"Fourthly, when we revolve in our minds the great similarity of structure,"|FALSE
15707|"which obtains in all the warm-blooded animals, as well quadrupeds, birds,"|FALSE
15707|"and amphibious animals, as in mankind; from the mouse and bat to the"|FALSE
15707|"elephant and whale; one is led to conclude, that they have alike been"|FALSE
15707|"produced from a similar living filament. In some this filament in its"|FALSE
15707|"advance to maturity has acquired hands and fingers, with a fine sense of"|FALSE
15707|"touch, as in mankind. In others it has acquired claws or talons, as in"|FALSE
15707|"tygers and eagles. In others, toes with an intervening web, or membrane, as"|FALSE
15707|"in seals and geese. In others it has acquired cloven hoofs, as in cows and"|FALSE
15707|"swine; and whole hoofs in others, as in the horse. While in the bird kind"|FALSE
15707|"this original living filament has put forth wings instead of arms or legs,"|FALSE
15707|"and feathers instead of hair. In some it has protruded horns on the"|FALSE
15707|"forehead instead of teeth in the fore part of the upper jaw; in others"|FALSE
15707|"tushes instead of horns; and in others beaks instead of either. And all"|FALSE
15707|"this exactly as is daily seen in the transmutations of the tadpole, which"|FALSE
15707|"acquires legs and lungs, when he wants them; and loses his tail, when it is"|FALSE
15707|"no longer of service to him."|FALSE
15707|"Fifthly, from their first rudiment, or primordium, to the termination of"|FALSE
15707|"their lives, all animals undergo perpetual transformations; which are in"|FALSE
15707|"part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires and"|FALSE
15707|"aversions, of their pleasures and their pains, or of irritations, or of"|FALSE
15707|"associations; and many of these acquired forms or propensities are"|FALSE
15707|"transmitted to their posterity. See Sect. XXXI. 1."|FALSE
15707|"As air and water are supplied to animals in sufficient profusion, the three"|FALSE
15707|"great objects of desire, which have changed the forms of many animals by"|FALSE
15707|"their exertions to gratify them, are those of lust, hunger, and security. A"|FALSE
15707|"great want of one part of the animal world has consisted in the desire of"|FALSE
15707|"the exclusive possession of the females; and these have acquired weapons to"|FALSE
15707|"combat each other for this purpose, as the very thick, shield-like, horny"|FALSE
15707|"skin on the shoulder of the boar is a defence only against animals of his"|FALSE
15707|"own species, who strike obliquely upwards, nor are his tushes for other"|FALSE
15707|"purposes, except to defend himself, as he is not naturally a carnivorous"|FALSE
15707|"animal. So the horns of the stag are sharp to offend his adversary, but are"|FALSE
15707|"branched for the purpose of parrying or receiving the thrusts of horns"|FALSE
15707|"similar to his own, and have therefore been formed for the purpose of"|FALSE
15707|"combating other stags for the exclusive possession of the females; who are"|FALSE
15707|"observed, like the ladies in the times of chivalry, to attend the car of"|FALSE
15707|"the victor."|FALSE
15707|"The birds, which do not carry food to their young, and do not therefore"|FALSE
15707|"marry, are armed with spurs for the purpose of fighting for the exclusive"|FALSE
15707|"possession of the females, as cocks and quails. It is certain that these"|FALSE
15707|"weapons are not provided for their defence against other adversaries,"|FALSE
15707|"because the females of these species are without this armour. The final"|FALSE
15707|"cause of this contest amongst the males seems to be, that the strongest and"|FALSE
15707|"most active animal should propagate the species, which should thence become"|FALSE
15707|"improved."|FALSE
15707|"Another great want consists in the means of procuring food, which has"|FALSE
15707|"diversified the forms of all species of animals. Thus the nose of the swine"|FALSE
15707|"has become hard for the purpose of turning up the soil in search of insects"|FALSE
15707|"and of roots. The trunk of the elephant is an elongation of the nose for"|FALSE
15707|"the purpose of pulling down the branches of trees for his food, and for"|FALSE
15707|"taking up water without bending his knees. Beasts of prey have acquired"|FALSE
15707|"strong jaws or talons. Cattle have acquired a rough tongue and a rough"|FALSE
15707|"palate to pull off the blades of grass, as cows and sheep. Some birds have"|FALSE
15707|"acquired harder beaks to crack nuts, as the parrot. Others have acquired"|FALSE
15707|"beaks adapted to break the harder seeds, as sparrows. Others for the softer"|FALSE
15707|"seeds of flowers, or the buds of trees, as the finches. Other birds have"|FALSE
15707|"acquired long beaks to penetrate the moister soils in search of insects or"|FALSE
15707|"roots, as woodcocks; and others broad ones to filtrate the water of lakes,"|FALSE
15707|"and to retain aquatic insects. All which seem to have been gradually"|FALSE
15707|"produced during many generations by the perpetual endeavour of the"|FALSE
15707|"creatures to supply the want of food, and to have been delivered to their"|FALSE
15707|"posterity with constant improvement of them for the purposes required."|FALSE
15707|"The third great want amongst animals is that of security, which seems much"|FALSE
15707|"to have diversified the forms of their bodies and the colour of them; these"|FALSE
15707|"consist in the means of escaping other animals more powerful than"|FALSE
15707|"themselves. Hence some animals have acquired wings instead of legs, as the"|FALSE
15707|"smaller birds, for the purpose of escape. Others great length of fin, or of"|FALSE
15707|"membrane, as the flying fish, and the bat. Others great swiftness of foot,"|FALSE
15707|"as the hare. Others have acquired hard or armed shells, as the tortoise and"|FALSE
15707|"the echinus marinus."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. Osbeck, a pupil of Linnæus, mentions the American frog fish, Lophius"|FALSE
15707|"Histrio, which inhabits the large floating islands of sea-weed about the"|FALSE
15707|"Cape of Good Hope, and has fulcra resembling leaves, that the fishes of"|FALSE
15707|"prey may mistake it for the sea-weed, which it inhabits. Voyage to China,"|FALSE
15707|"p. 113."|FALSE
15707|"The contrivances for the purposes of security extend even to vegetables, as"|FALSE
15707|"is seen in the wonderful and various means of their concealing or defending"|FALSE
15707|"their honey from insects, and their seeds from birds. On the other hand"|FALSE
15707|"swiftness of wing has been acquired by hawks and swallows to pursue their"|FALSE
15707|"prey; and a proboscis of admirable structure has been acquired by the bee,"|FALSE
15707|"the moth, and the humming bird, for the purpose of plundering the nectaries"|FALSE
15707|"of flowers. All which seem to have been formed by the original living"|FALSE
15707|"filament, excited into action by the necessities of the creatures, which"|FALSE
15707|"possess them, and on which their existence depends."|FALSE
15707|"From thus meditating on the great similarity of the structure of the"|FALSE
15707|"warm-blooded animals, and at the same time of the great changes they"|FALSE
15707|"undergo both before and after their nativity; and by considering in how"|FALSE
15707|"minute a portion of time many of the changes of animals above described"|FALSE
15707|"have been produced; would it be too bold to imagine, that in the great"|FALSE
15707|"length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages"|FALSE
15707|"before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to"|FALSE
15707|"imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living"|FALSE
15707|"filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality, with the power"|FALSE
15707|"of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by"|FALSE
15707|"irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing"|FALSE
15707|"the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of"|FALSE
15707|"delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world"|FALSE
15707|"without end!"|FALSE
15707|"Sixthly, The cold-blooded animals, as the fish-tribes, which are furnished"|FALSE
15707|"with but one ventricle of the heart, and with gills instead of lungs, and"|FALSE
15707|"with fins instead of feet or wings, bear a great similarity to each other;"|FALSE
15707|"but they differ, nevertheless, so much in their general structure from the"|FALSE
15707|"warm-blooded animals, that it may not seem probable at first view, that the"|FALSE
15707|"same living filament could have given origin to this kingdom of animals, as"|FALSE
15707|"to the former. Yet are there some creatures, which unite or partake of both"|FALSE
15707|"these orders of animation, as the whales and seals; and more particularly"|FALSE
15707|"the frog, who changes from an aquatic animal furnished with gills to an"|FALSE
15707|"aerial one furnished with lungs."|FALSE
15707|"The numerous tribes of insects without wings, from the spider to the"|FALSE
15707|"scorpion, from the flea to the lobster; or with wings, from the gnat and"|FALSE
15707|"the ant to the wasp and the dragon-fly, differ so totally from each other,"|FALSE
15707|"and from the red-blooded classes above described, both in the forms of"|FALSE
15707|"their bodies, and their modes of life; besides the organ of sense, which"|FALSE
15707|"they seem to possess in their antennæ or horns, to which it has been"|FALSE
15707|"thought by some naturalists, that other creatures have nothing similar;"|FALSE
15707|"that it can scarcely be supposed that this nation of animals could have"|FALSE
15707|"been produced by the same kind of living filament, as the red-blooded"|FALSE
15707|"classes above mentioned. And yet the changes which many of them undergo in"|FALSE
15707|"their early state to that of their maturity, are as different, as one"|FALSE
15707|"animal can be from another. As those of the gnat, which passes his early"|FALSE
15707|"state in water, and then stretching out his new wings, and expanding his"|FALSE
15707|"new lungs, rises in the air; as of the caterpillar, and bee-nymph, which"|FALSE
15707|"feed on vegetable leaves or farina, and at length bursting from their"|FALSE
15707|"self-formed graves, become beautiful winged inhabitants of the skies,"|FALSE
15707|"journeying from flower to flower, and nourished by the ambrosial food of"|FALSE
15707|"honey."|FALSE
15707|"There is still another class of animals, which are termed vermes by"|FALSE
15707|"Linnæus, which are without feet, or brain, and are hermaphrodites, as"|FALSE
15707|"worms, leeches, snails, shell-fish, coralline insects, and sponges; which"|FALSE
15707|"possess the simplest structure of all animals, and appear totally different"|FALSE
15707|"from those already described. The simplicity of their structure, however,"|FALSE
15707|"can afford no argument against their having been produced from a living"|FALSE
15707|"filament as above contended."|FALSE
15707|"Last of all the various tribes of vegetables are to be enumerated amongst"|FALSE
15707|"the inferior orders of animals. Of these the anthers and stigmas have"|FALSE
15707|"already been shewn to possess some organs of sense, to be nourished by"|FALSE
15707|"honey, and to have the power of generation like insects, and have thence"|FALSE
15707|"been announced amongst the animal kingdom in Sect. XIII. and to these must"|FALSE
15707|"be added the buds and bulbs which constitute the viviparous offspring of"|FALSE
15707|"vegetation. The former I suppose to be beholden to a single living filament"|FALSE
15707|"for their seminal or amatorial procreation; and the latter to the same"|FALSE
15707|"cause for their lateral or branching generation, which they possess in"|FALSE
15707|"common with the polypus, tænia, and volvox; and the simplicity of which is"|FALSE
15707|"an argument in favour of the similarity of its cause."|FALSE
15707|"Linnæus supposes, in the Introduction to his Natural Orders, that very few"|FALSE
15707|"vegetables were at first created, and that their numbers were increased by"|FALSE
15707|"their intermarriages, and adds, suadent hæc Creatoris leges a simplicibus"|FALSE
15707|"ad composita. Many other changes seem to have arisen in them by their"|FALSE
15707|"perpetual contest for light and air above ground, and for food or moisture"|FALSE
15707|"beneath the soil. As noted in Botanic Garden, Part II. Note on Cuscuta."|FALSE
15707|"Other changes of vegetables from climate, or other causes, are remarked in"|FALSE
15707|"the Note on Curcuma in the same work. From these one might be led to"|FALSE
15707|"imagine, that each plant at first consisted of a single bulb or flower to"|FALSE
15707|"each root, as the gentianella and daisy; and that in the contest for air"|FALSE
15707|"and light new buds grew on the old decaying flower stem, shooting down"|FALSE
15707|"their elongated roots to the ground, and that in process of ages tall trees"|FALSE
15707|"were thus formed, and an individual bulb became a swarm of vegetables."|FALSE
15707|"Other plants, which in this contest for light and air were too slender to"|FALSE
15707|"rise by their own strength, learned by degrees to adhere to their"|FALSE
15707|"neighbours, either by putting forth roots like the ivy, or by tendrils like"|FALSE
15707|"the vine, or by spiral contortions like the honeysuckle; or by growing upon"|FALSE
15707|"them like the misleto, and taking nourishment from their barks; or by only"|FALSE
15707|"lodging or adhering on them, and deriving nourishment from the air, as"|FALSE
15707|"tillandsia."|FALSE
15707|"Shall we then say that the vegetable living filament was originally"|FALSE
15707|"different from that of each tribe of animals above described? And that the"|FALSE
15707|"productive living filament of each of those tribes was different originally"|FALSE
15707|"from the other? Or, as the earth and ocean were probably peopled with"|FALSE
15707|"vegetable productions long before the existence of animals; and many"|FALSE
15707|"families of these animals long before other families of them, shall we"|FALSE
15707|"conjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been"|FALSE
15707|"the cause of all organic life?"|FALSE
15707|"This idea of the gradual formation and improvement of the animal world"|FALSE
15707|"accords with the observations of some modern philosophers, who have"|FALSE
15707|"supposed that the continent of America has been raised out of the ocean at"|FALSE
15707|"a later period of time than the other three quarters of the globe, which"|FALSE
15707|"they deduce from the greater comparative heights of its mountains, and the"|FALSE
15707|"consequent greater coldness of its respective climates, and from the less"|FALSE
15707|"size and strength of its animals, as the tygers and allegators compared"|FALSE
15707|"with those of Asia or Africa. And lastly, from the less progress in the"|FALSE
15707|"improvements of the mind of its inhabitants in respect to voluntary"|FALSE
15707|"exertions."|FALSE
15707|"This idea of the gradual formation and improvement of the animal world"|FALSE
15707|"seems not to have been unknown to the ancient philosophers. Plato having"|FALSE
15707|"probably observed the reciprocal generation of inferior animals, as snails"|FALSE
15707|"and worms, was of opinion, that mankind with all other animals were"|FALSE
15707|"originally hermaphrodites during the infancy of the world, and were in"|FALSE
15707|"process of time separated into male and female. The breasts and teats of"|FALSE
15707|"all male quadrupeds, to which no use can be now assigned, adds perhaps some"|FALSE
15707|"shadow of probability to this opinion. Linnæus excepts the horse from the"|FALSE
15707|"male quadrupeds, who have teats; which might have shewn the earlier origin"|FALSE
15707|"of his exigence; but Mr. J. Hunter asserts, that he has discovered the"|FALSE
15707|"vestiges of them on his sheath, and has at the same time enriched natural"|FALSE
15707|"history with a very curious fact concerning the male pigeon; at the time of"|FALSE
15707|"hatching the eggs both the male and female pigeon undergo a great change in"|FALSE
15707|"their crops; which thicken and become corrugated, and secrete a kind of"|FALSE
15707|"milky fluid, which coagulates, and with which alone they for a few days"|FALSE
15707|"feed their young, and afterwards feed them with this coagulated fluid mixed"|FALSE
15707|"with other food. How this resembles the breasts of female quadrupeds after"|FALSE
15707|"the production of their young! and how extraordinary, that the male should"|FALSE
15707|"at this time give milk as well as the female! See Botanic Garden, Part II."|FALSE
15707|"Note on Curcuma."|FALSE
15707|"The late Mr. David Hume, in his posthumous works, places the powers of"|FALSE
15707|"generation much above those of our boasted reason; and adds, that reason"|FALSE
15707|"can only make a machine, as a clock or a ship, but the power of generation"|FALSE
15707|"makes the maker of the machine; and probably from having observed, that the"|FALSE
15707|"greatest part of the earth has been formed out of organic recrements; as"|FALSE
15707|"the immense beds of limestone, chalk, marble, from the shells of fish; and"|FALSE
15707|"the extensive provinces of clay, sandstone, ironstone, coals, from"|FALSE
15707|"decomposed vegetables; all which have been first produced by generation, or"|FALSE
15707|"by the secretions of organic life; he concludes that the world itself might"|FALSE
15707|"have been generated, rather than created; that is, it might have been"|FALSE
15707|"gradually produced from very small beginnings, increasing by the activity"|FALSE
15707|"of its inherent principles, rather than by a sudden evolution of the whole"|FALSE
15707|"by the Almighty fire.--What a magnificent idea of the infinite power of THE"|FALSE
15707|"GREAT ARCHITECT! THE CAUSE OF CAUSES! PARENT OF PARENTS! ENS ENTIUM!"|FALSE
15707|"For if we may compare infinities, it would seem to require a greater"|FALSE
15707|"infinity of power to cause the causes of effects, than to cause the effects"|FALSE
15707|"themselves. This idea is analogous to the improving excellence observable"|FALSE
15707|"in every part of the creation; such as in the progressive increase of the"|FALSE
15707|"solid or habitable parts of the earth from water; and in the progressive"|FALSE
15707|"increase of the wisdom and happiness of its inhabitants; and is consonant"|FALSE
15707|"to the idea of our present situation being a state of probation, which by"|FALSE
15707|"our exertions we may improve, and are consequently responsible for our"|FALSE
15707|"actions."|FALSE
15707|"V. 1. The efficient cause of the various colours of the eggs of birds, and"|FALSE
15707|"of the air and feathers of animals, is a subject so curious, that I shall"|FALSE
15707|"beg to introduce it in this place. The colours of many animals seem adapted"|FALSE
15707|"to their purposes of concealing themselves either to avoid danger, or to"|FALSE
15707|"spring upon their prey. Thus the snake and wild cat, and leopard, are so"|FALSE
15707|"coloured as to resemble dark leaves and their lighter interstices; birds"|FALSE
15707|"resemble the colour of the brown ground, or the green hedges, which they"|FALSE
15707|"frequent; and moths and butterflies are coloured like the flowers which"|FALSE
15707|"they rob of their honey. Many instances are mentioned of this kind in"|FALSE
15707|"Botanic Garden, p. 2. Note on Rubia."|FALSE
15707|"These colours have, however, in some instances another use, as the black"|FALSE
15707|"diverging area from the eyes of the swan; which, as his eyes are placed"|FALSE
15707|"less prominent than those of other birds, for the convenience of putting"|FALSE
15707|"down his head under water, prevents the rays of light from being reflected"|FALSE
15707|"into his eye, and thus dazzling his sight, both in air and beneath the"|FALSE
15707|"water; which must have happened, if that surface had been white like the"|FALSE
15707|"rest of his feathers."|FALSE
15707|"There is a still more wonderful thing concerning these colours adapted to"|FALSE
15707|"the purpose of concealment; which is, that the eggs of birds are so"|FALSE
15707|"coloured as to resemble the colour of the adjacent objects and their"|FALSE
15707|"interfaces. The eggs of hedge-birds are greenish with dark spots; those of"|FALSE
15707|"crows and magpies, which are seen from beneath through wicker nests, are"|FALSE
15707|"white with dark spots; and those of larks and partridges are russet or"|FALSE
15707|"brown, like their nests or situations."|FALSE
15707|"A thing still more astonishing is, that many animals in countries covered"|FALSE
15707|"with snow become white in winter, and are said to change their colour again"|FALSE
15707|"in the warmer months, as bears, hares, and partridges. Our domesticated"|FALSE
15707|"animals lose their natural colours, and break into great variety, as"|FALSE
15707|"horses, dogs, pigeons. The final cause of these colours is easily"|FALSE
15707|"understood, as they serve some purposes of the animal, but the efficient"|FALSE
15707|"cause would seem almost beyond conjecture."|FALSE
15707|"First, the choroid coat of the eye, on which the semitransparent retina is"|FALSE
15707|"expanded, is of different colour in different animals; in those which feed"|FALSE
15707|"on grass it is green; from hence there would appear some connexion between"|FALSE
15707|"the colour of the choroid coat and of that constantly painted on the retina"|FALSE
15707|"by the green grass. Now, when the ground becomes covered with snow, it"|FALSE
15707|"would seem, that that action of the retina, which is called whiteness,"|FALSE
15707|"being constantly excited in the eye, may be gradually imitated by the"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of the nerves of touch, or rete mucosum of the skin. And if it"|FALSE
15707|"be supposed, that the action of the retina in producing the perception of"|FALSE
15707|"any colour consists in so disposing its own fibres or surface, as to"|FALSE
15707|"reflect those coloured rays only, and transmit the others like"|FALSE
15707|"soap-bubbles; then that part of the retina, which gives us the perception"|FALSE
15707|"of snow, must at that time be white; and that which gives us the perception"|FALSE
15707|"of grass, must be green."|FALSE
15707|"Then if by the laws of imitation, as explained in Section XII. 3. 3. and"|FALSE
15707|"XXXIX. 6. the extremities of the nerves of touch in the rete mucosum be"|FALSE
15707|"induced into similar action, the skin or feathers, or hair, may in like"|FALSE
15707|"manner so dispose their extreme fibres, as to reflect white; for it is"|FALSE
15707|"evident, that all these parts were originally obedient to irritative"|FALSE
15707|"motions during their growth, and probably continue to be so; that those"|FALSE
15707|"irritative motions are not liable in a healthy state to be succeeded by"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; which however is no uncommon thing in their diseased state, or"|FALSE
15707|"in their infant state, as in plica polonica, and in very young"|FALSE
15707|"pen-feathers, which are still full of blood."|FALSE
15707|"It was shewn in Section XV. on the Production of Ideas, that the moving"|FALSE
15707|"organ of sense in some circumstances resembled the object which produced"|FALSE
15707|"that motion. Hence it may be conceived, that the rete mucosum, which is the"|FALSE
15707|"extremity of the nerves of touch, may by imitating the motions of the"|FALSE
15707|"retina become coloured. And thus, like the fable of the camelion, all"|FALSE
15707|"animals may possess a tendency to be coloured somewhat like the colours"|FALSE
15707|"they most frequently inspect, and finally, that colours may be thus given"|FALSE
15707|"to the egg-shell by the imagination of the female parent; which shell is"|FALSE
15707|"previously a mucous membrane, indued with irritability, without which it"|FALSE
15707|"could not circulate its fluids, and increase in its bulk. Nor is this more"|FALSE
15707|"wonderful than that a single idea of imagination mould in an instant colour"|FALSE
15707|"the whole surface of the body of a bright scarlet, as in the blush of"|FALSE
15707|"shame, though by a very different process. In this intricate subject"|FALSE
15707|"nothing but loose analogical conjectures can be had, which may however lead"|FALSE
15707|"to future discoveries; but certain it is that both the change of the colour"|FALSE
15707|"of animals to white in the winters of snowy countries, and the spots on"|FALSE
15707|"birds eggs, must have some efficient cause; since the uniformity of their"|FALSE
15707|"production shews it cannot arise from a fortuitous concurrence of"|FALSE
15707|"circumstances; and how is this efficient cause to be detected, or"|FALSE
15707|"explained, but from its analogy to other animal facts?"|FALSE
15707|"2. The nutriment supplied by the female parent in viviparous animals to"|FALSE
15707|"their young progeny may be divided into three kinds, corresponding with the"|FALSE
15707|"age of the new creature. 1. The nutriment contained in the ovum as"|FALSE
15707|"previously prepared for the embryon in the ovary. 2. The liquor amnii"|FALSE
15707|"prepared for the fetus in the uterus, and in which it swims; and lastly,"|FALSE
15707|"the milk prepared in the pectoral glands for the new born-child. There is"|FALSE
15707|"reason to conclude that variety of changes may be produced in the new"|FALSE
15707|"animal from all these sources of nutriment, but particularly from the first"|FALSE
15707|"of them.."|FALSE
15707|"The organs of digestion and of sanguification in adults, and afterwards"|FALSE
15707|"those of secretion, prepare or separate the particles proper for"|FALSE
15707|"nourishment from other combinations of matter, or recombine them into new"|FALSE
15707|"kinds of matter, proper to excite into action the filaments, which absorb"|FALSE
15707|"or attract them by animal appetency. In this process we must attend not"|FALSE
15707|"only to the action of the living filament which receives a nutritive"|FALSE
15707|"particle to its bosom, but also to the kind of particle, in respect to"|FALSE
15707|"form, or size, or colour, or hardness, which is thus previously prepared"|FALSE
15707|"for it by digestion, sanguification, and secretion. Now as the first"|FALSE
15707|"filament of entity cannot be furnished with the preparative organs above"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned, the nutritive particles, which are at first to be received by"|FALSE
15707|"it, are prepared by the mother; and deposited in the ovum ready for its"|FALSE
15707|"reception. These nutritive particles must be supposed to differ in some"|FALSE
15707|"respects, when thus prepared by different animals. They may differ in size,"|FALSE
15707|"solidity, colour, and form; and yet may be sufficiently congenial to the"|FALSE
15707|"living filament, to which they are applied, as to excite its activity by"|FALSE
15707|"their stimulus, and its animal appetency to receive them, and to combine"|FALSE
15707|"them with itself into organization."|FALSE
15707|"By this first nutriment thus prepared for the embryon is not meant the"|FALSE
15707|"liquor amnii, which is produced afterwards, nor the larger exterior parts"|FALSE
15707|"of the white of the egg; but the fluid prepared, I suppose, in the ovary of"|FALSE
15707|"viviparous animals, and that which immediately surrounds the cicatricula of"|FALSE
15707|"an impregnated egg, and is visible to the eye in a boiled one."|FALSE
15707|"Now these ultimate particles of animal matter prepared by the glands of the"|FALSE
15707|"mother may be supposed to resemble the similar ultimate particles, which"|FALSE
15707|"were prepared for her own nourishment; that is, to the ultimate particles"|FALSE
15707|"of which her own organization consists. And that hence when these become"|FALSE
15707|"combined with a new embryon, which in its early state is not furnished with"|FALSE
15707|"stomach, or glands, to alter them; that new embryon will bear some"|FALSE
15707|"resemblance to the mother."|FALSE
15707|"This seems to be the origin of the compound forms of mules, which evidently"|FALSE
15707|"partake of both parents, but principally of the male parent. In this"|FALSE
15707|"production of chimeras the antients seem to have indulged their fancies,"|FALSE
15707|"whence the sphinxes, griffins, dragons, centaurs, and minotaurs, which are"|FALSE
15707|"vanished from modern credulity."|FALSE
15707|"It would seem, that in these unnatural conjunctions, when the nutriment"|FALSE
15707|"deposited by the female was so ill adapted to stimulate the living filament"|FALSE
15707|"derived from the male into action, and to be received; or embraced by it,"|FALSE
15707|"and combined with it into organization, as not to produce the organs"|FALSE
15707|"necessary to life, as the brain, or heart, or stomach, that no mule was"|FALSE
15707|"produced. Where all the parts necessary to life in these compound animals"|FALSE
15707|"were formed sufficiently perfect, except the parts of generation, those"|FALSE
15707|"animals were produced which are now called mules."|FALSE
15707|"The formation of the organs of sexual generation, in contradistinction to"|FALSE
15707|"that by lateral buds, in vegetables, and in some animals, as the polypus,"|FALSE
15707|"the tænia, and the volvox, seems the chef d'oeuvre, the master-piece of"|FALSE
15707|"nature; as appears from many flying insects, as in moths and butterflies,"|FALSE
15707|"who seem to undergo a general change of their forms solely for the purpose"|FALSE
15707|"of sexual reproduction, and in all other animals this organ is not complete"|FALSE
15707|"till the maturity of the creature. Whence it happens that, in the"|FALSE
15707|"copulation of animals of different species, the parts necessary to life are"|FALSE
15707|"frequently completely formed; but those for the purpose of generation are"|FALSE
15707|"defective, as requiring a nicer organization; or more exact coincidence of"|FALSE
15707|"the particles of nutriment to the irritabilities or appetencies of the"|FALSE
15707|"original living filament. Whereas those mules, where all the parts could be"|FALSE
15707|"perfectly formed, may have been produced in early periods of time, and may"|FALSE
15707|"have added to the numbers of our various species of animals, as before"|FALSE
15707|"observed."|FALSE
15707|"As this production of mules is a constant effect from the conjunction of"|FALSE
15707|"different species of animals, those between the horse and the female ass"|FALSE
15707|"always resembling the horse more than the ass; and those, on the contrary,"|FALSE
15707|"between the male ass and the mare, always resembling the ass more than the"|FALSE
15707|"mare; it cannot be ascribed to the imagination of the male animal which"|FALSE
15707|"cannot be supposed to operate so uniformly; but to the form of the first"|FALSE
15707|"nutritive particles, and to their peculiar stimulus exciting the living"|FALSE
15707|"filament to select and combine them with itself. There is a similar"|FALSE
15707|"uniformity of effect in respect to the colour of the progeny produced"|FALSE
15707|"between a white man, and a black woman, which, if I am well informed, is"|FALSE
15707|"always of the mulatto kind, or a mixture of the two; which may perhaps be"|FALSE
15707|"imputed to the peculiar form of the particles of nutriment supplied to the"|FALSE
15707|"embryon by the mother at the early period of its existence, and their"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar stimulus; as this effect, like that of the mule progeny above"|FALSE
15707|"treated of, is uniform and consistent, and cannot therefore be ascribed to"|FALSE
15707|"the imagination of either of the parents."|FALSE
15707|"Dr. Thunberg observes, in his Journey to the Cape of Good Hope, that there"|FALSE
15707|"are some families, which have descended from blacks in the female line for"|FALSE
15707|"three generations. The first generation proceeding from an European, who"|FALSE
15707|"married a tawny slave, remains tawny, but approaches to a white complexion;"|FALSE
15707|"but the children of the third generation, mixed with Europeans, become"|FALSE
15707|"quite white, and are often remarkably beautiful. V. i. p. 112."|FALSE
15707|"When the embryon has produced a placenta, and furnished itself with vessels"|FALSE
15707|"for selection of nutritious particles, and for oxygenation of them, no"|FALSE
15707|"great change in its form or colour is likely to be produced by the"|FALSE
15707|"particles of sustenance it now takes from the fluid, in which it is"|FALSE
15707|"immersed; because it has now acquired organs to alter or new combine them."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it continues to grow, whether this fluid, in which it swims, be"|FALSE
15707|"formed by the uterus or by any other cavity of the body, as in"|FALSE
15707|"extra-uterine gestation; and which would seem to be produced by the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of the fetus on the sides of the cavity, where it is found, as"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned before. And thirdly, there is still less reason to expect any"|FALSE
15707|"unnatural change to happen to the child after its birth from the difference"|FALSE
15707|"of the milk it now takes; because it has acquired a stomach, and lungs, and"|FALSE
15707|"glands, of sufficient power to decompose and recombine the milk; and thus"|FALSE
15707|"to prepare from it the various kinds of nutritious particles, which the"|FALSE
15707|"appetencies of the various fibrils or nerves may require."|FALSE
15707|"From all this reasoning I would conclude, that though the imagination of"|FALSE
15707|"the female may be supposed to affect the embryon by producing a difference"|FALSE
15707|"in its early nutriment; yet that no such power can affect it after it has"|FALSE
15707|"obtained a placenta, and other organs; which may select or change the food,"|FALSE
15707|"which is presented to it either in the liquor amnii, or in the milk. Now as"|FALSE
15707|"the eggs in pullets, like the seeds in vegetables, are produced gradually,"|FALSE
15707|"long before they are impregnated, it does not appear how any sudden effect"|FALSE
15707|"of imagination of the mother at the time of impregnation can produce any"|FALSE
15707|"considerable change in the nutriment already thus laid up for the expected"|FALSE
15707|"or desired embryon. And that hence any changes of the embryon, except those"|FALSE
15707|"uniform ones in the production of mules and mulattoes, more probably depend"|FALSE
15707|"on the imagination of the male parent. At the same time it seems manifest,"|FALSE
15707|"that those monstrous births, which consist in some deficiencies only, or"|FALSE
15707|"some redundancies of parts, originate from the deficiency or redundance of"|FALSE
15707|"the first nutriment prepared in the ovary, or in the part of the egg"|FALSE
15707|"immediately surrounding the cicatricula, as described above; and which"|FALSE
15707|"continues some time to excite the first living filament into action, after"|FALSE
15707|"the simple animal is completed; or ceases to excite it, before the complete"|FALSE
15707|"form is accomplished. The former of these circumstances is evinced by the"|FALSE
15707|"eggs with double yolks, which frequently happen to our domesticated"|FALSE
15707|"poultry, and which, I believe, are so formed before impregnation, but which"|FALSE
15707|"would be well worth attending to, both before and after impregnation; as it"|FALSE
15707|"is probable, something valuable on this subject might be learnt from them."|FALSE
15707|"The latter circumstance, or that of deficiency of original nutriment, may"|FALSE
15707|"be deduced from reverse analogy."|FALSE
15707|"There are, however, other kinds of monstrous births, which neither depend"|FALSE
15707|"on deficiency of parts, or supernumerary ones; nor are owing to the"|FALSE
15707|"conjunction of animals of different species; but which appear to be new"|FALSE
15707|"conformations, or new dispositions of parts in respect to each other, and"|FALSE
15707|"which, like the variation of colours and forms of our domesticated animals,"|FALSE
15707|"and probably the sexual parts of all animals, may depend on the imagination"|FALSE
15707|"of the male parent, which we now come to consider."|FALSE
15707|"VI. 1. The nice actions of the extremities of our various glands are"|FALSE
15707|"exhibited in their various productions, which are believed to be made by"|FALSE
15707|"the gland, and not previously to exist as such in the blood."|FALSE
15707|"Thus the glands, which constitute the liver, make bile; those of the"|FALSE
15707|"stomach make gastric acid; those beneath the jaw, saliva; those of the"|FALSE
15707|"ears, ear-wax; and the like. Every kind of gland must possess a peculiar"|FALSE
15707|"irritability, and probably a sensibility, at the early state of its"|FALSE
15707|"existence; and must be furnished with a nerve of sense, or of motion, to"|FALSE
15707|"perceive, and to select, and to combine the particles, which compose the"|FALSE
15707|"fluid it secretes. And this nerve of sense which perceives the different"|FALSE
15707|"articles which compose the blood, must at least be conceived to be as fine"|FALSE
15707|"and subtile an organ, as the optic or auditory nerve, which perceive light"|FALSE
15707|"or sound. See Sect. XIV. 9."|FALSE
15707|"But in nothing is this nice action of the extremities of the blood-vessels"|FALSE
15707|"so wonderful, as in the production of contagious matter. A small drop of"|FALSE
15707|"variolous contagion diffused in the blood, or perhaps only by being"|FALSE
15707|"inserted beneath the cuticle, after a time, (as about a quarter of a"|FALSE
15707|"lunation,) excites the extreme vessels of the skin into certain motions,"|FALSE
15707|"which produce a similar contagious material, filling with it a thousand"|FALSE
15707|"pustules. So that by irritation, or by sensation in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"irritation, or by association of motions, a material is formed by the"|FALSE
15707|"extremities of certain cutaneous vessels, exactly similar to the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulating material, which caused the irritation, or consequent sensation,"|FALSE
15707|"or association."|FALSE
15707|"Many glands of the body have their motions, and in consequence their"|FALSE
15707|"secreted fluids, affected by pleasurable or painful ideas, since they are"|FALSE
15707|"in many instances influenced by sensitive associations, as well as by the"|FALSE
15707|"irritations of the particles of the passing blood. Thus the idea of meat,"|FALSE
15707|"excited in the minds of hungry dogs, by their sense of vision, or of smell,"|FALSE
15707|"increases the discharge of saliva, both in quantity and viscidity; as is"|FALSE
15707|"seen in its hanging down in threads from their mouths, as they stand round"|FALSE
15707|"a dinner-table. The sensations of pleasure, or of pain, of peculiar kinds,"|FALSE
15707|"excite in the same manner a great discharge of tears; which appear also to"|FALSE
15707|"be more saline at the time of their secretion, from their inflaming the"|FALSE
15707|"eyes and eye-lids. The paleness from fear, and the blush of shame, and of"|FALSE
15707|"joy, are other instances of the effects of painful, or pleasurable"|FALSE
15707|"sensations, on the extremities of the arterial system."|FALSE
15707|"It is probable, that the pleasurable sensation excited in the stomach by"|FALSE
15707|"food, as well as its irritation, contributes to excite into action the"|FALSE
15707|"gastric glands, and to produce a greater secretion of their fluids. The"|FALSE
15707|"same probably occurs in the secretion of bile; that is, that the"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable sensation excited in the stomach, affects this secretion by"|FALSE
15707|"sensitive association, as well as by irritative association."|FALSE
15707|"And lastly it would seem, that all the glands in the body have their"|FALSE
15707|"secreted fluids affected, in quantity and quality, by the pleasurable or"|FALSE
15707|"painful sensations, which produce or accompany those secretions. And that"|FALSE
15707|"the pleasurable sensations arising from these secretions may constitute the"|FALSE
15707|"unnamed pleasure of exigence, which is contrary to what is meant by tedium"|FALSE
15707|"vitæ, or ennui; and by which we sometimes feel ourselves happy, without"|FALSE
15707|"being able to ascribe it to any mental cause, as after an agreeable meal,"|FALSE
15707|"or in the beginning of intoxication."|FALSE
15707|"Now it would appear, that no secretion or excretion of fluid is attended"|FALSE
15707|"with so much agreeable sensation, as that of the semen; and it would thence"|FALSE
15707|"follow, that the glands, which perform this secretion, are more likely to"|FALSE
15707|"be much affected by their catenations with pleasurable sensations. This"|FALSE
15707|"circumstance is certain, that much more of this fluid is produced in a"|FALSE
15707|"given time, when the object of its exclusion is agreeable to the mind."|FALSE
15707|"2. A forceable argument, which shews the necessity of pleasurable sensation"|FALSE
15707|"to copulation, is, that the act cannot be performed without it; it is"|FALSE
15707|"easily interrupted by the pain of fear or bashfulness; and no efforts of"|FALSE
15707|"volition or of irritation can effect this process, except such as induce"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable ideas or sensations. See Sect. XXXIII. 1. 1."|FALSE
15707|"A curious analogical circumstance attending hermaphrodite insects, as"|FALSE
15707|"snails and worms, still further illustrates this theory; if the snail or"|FALSE
15707|"worm could have impregnated itself, there might have been a saving of a"|FALSE
15707|"large male apparatus; but as this is not so ordered by nature, but each"|FALSE
15707|"snail and worm reciprocally receives and gives impregnation, it appears,"|FALSE
15707|"that a pleasurable excitation seems also to have been required."|FALSE
15707|"This wonderful circumstance of many insects being hermaphrodites, and at"|FALSE
15707|"the same time not having power to impregnate themselves, is attended to by"|FALSE
15707|"Dr. Lister, in his Exercitationes Anatom. de Limacibus, p. 145; who,"|FALSE
15707|"amongst many other final causes, which he adduces to account for it, adds,"|FALSE
15707|"ut tam tristibus et frigidis animalibus majori cum voluptate perficiatur"|FALSE
15707|"venus."|FALSE
15707|"There is, however, another final cause, to which this circumstance may be"|FALSE
15707|"imputed: it was observed above, that vegetable buds and bulbs, which are"|FALSE
15707|"produced without a mother, are always exact resemblances of their parent;"|FALSE
15707|"as appears in grafting fruit-trees, and in the flower-buds of the dioiceous"|FALSE
15707|"plants, which are always of the same sex on the same tree; hence those"|FALSE
15707|"hermaphrodite insects, if they could have produced young without a mother,"|FALSE
15707|"would not have been, capable of that change or improvement, which is seen"|FALSE
15707|"in all other animals, and in those vegetables, which are procreated by the"|FALSE
15707|"male embryon received and nourished by the female. And it is hence"|FALSE
15707|"probable, that if vegetables could only have been produced by buds and"|FALSE
15707|"bulbs, and not by sexual generation, that there would not at this time have"|FALSE
15707|"existed one thousandth part of their present number of species; which have"|FALSE
15707|"probably been originally mule-productions; nor could any kind of"|FALSE
15707|"improvement or change have happened to them, except by the difference of"|FALSE
15707|"soil or climate."|FALSE
15707|"3. I conclude, that the imagination of the male at the time of copulation,"|FALSE
15707|"or at the time of the secretion of the semen, may so affect this secretion"|FALSE
15707|"by irritative or sensitive association, as described in No. 5. 1. of this"|FALSE
15707|"section, as to cause the production of similarity of form and of features,"|FALSE
15707|"with the distinction of sex; as the motions of the chissel of the turner"|FALSE
15707|"imitate or correspond with those of the ideas of the artist. It is not here"|FALSE
15707|"to be understood, that the first living fibre, which is to form an animal,"|FALSE
15707|"is produced with any similarity of form to the future animal; but with"|FALSE
15707|"propensities, or appetences, which shall produce by accretion of parts the"|FALSE
15707|"similarity of form, feature, or sex, corresponding to the imagination of"|FALSE
15707|"the father."|FALSE
15707|"Our ideas are movements of the nerves of sense, as of the optic nerve in"|FALSE
15707|"recollecting visible ideas, suppose of a triangular piece of ivory. The"|FALSE
15707|"fine moving fibres of the retina act in a manner to which I give the name"|FALSE
15707|"of white; and this action is confined to a defined part of it; to which"|FALSE
15707|"figure I give the name of triangle. And it is a preceding pleasurable"|FALSE
15707|"sensation existing in my mind, which occasions me to produce this"|FALSE
15707|"particular motion of the retina, when no triangle is present. Now it is"|FALSE
15707|"probable, that the acting fibres of the ultimate terminations of the"|FALSE
15707|"secreting apertures of the vessels of the testes, are as fine as those of"|FALSE
15707|"the retina; and that they are liable to be thrown into that peculiar"|FALSE
15707|"action, which marks the sex of the secreted embryon, by sympathy with the"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable motions of the nerves of vision or of touch; that is, with"|FALSE
15707|"certain ideas of imagination. From hence it would appear, that the world"|FALSE
15707|"has long been mistaken in ascribing great power to the imagination of the"|FALSE
15707|"female, whereas from this account of it, the real power of imagination, in"|FALSE
15707|"the act of generation, belongs solely to the male. See Sect. XII. 3. 3."|FALSE
15707|"It may be objected to this theory, that a man may be supposed to have in"|FALSE
15707|"his mind, the idea of the form and features of the female, rather than his"|FALSE
15707|"own, and therefore there should be a greater number of female births. On"|FALSE
15707|"the contrary, the general idea of our own form occurs to every one almost"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually, and is termed consciousness of our existence, and thus may"|FALSE
15707|"effect, that the number of males surpasses that of females. See Sect. XV."|FALSE
15707|"3. 4. and XVIII. 13. And what further confirms this idea is, that the male"|FALSE
15707|"children most frequently resemble the father in form, or feature, as well"|FALSE
15707|"as in sex; and the female most frequently resemble the mother, in feature,"|FALSE
15707|"and form, as well as in sex."|FALSE
15707|"It may again be objected, if a female child sometimes resembles the father,"|FALSE
15707|"and a male child the mother, the ideas of the father, at the time of"|FALSE
15707|"procreation, must suddenly change from himself to the mother, at the very"|FALSE
15707|"instant, when the embryon is secreted or formed. This difficulty ceases"|FALSE
15707|"when we consider, that it is as easy to form an idea of feminine features"|FALSE
15707|"with male organs of reproduction, or of male features with female ones, as"|FALSE
15707|"the contrary; as we conceive the idea of a sphinx or mermaid as easily and"|FALSE
15707|"as distinctly as of a woman. Add to this, that at the time of procreation"|FALSE
15707|"the idea of the male organs, and of the female features, are often both"|FALSE
15707|"excited at the same time, by contact, or by vision."|FALSE
15707|"I ask, in my turn, is the sex of the embryon produced by accident?"|FALSE
15707|"Certainly whatever is produced has a cause; but when this cause is too"|FALSE
15707|"minute for our comprehension, the effect is said in common language to"|FALSE
15707|"happen by chance, as in throwing a certain number on dice. Now what cause"|FALSE
15707|"can occasionally produce the male or female character of the embryon, but"|FALSE
15707|"the peculiar actions of those glands, which form the embryon? And what can"|FALSE
15707|"influence or govern these actions of the gland, but its associations or"|FALSE
15707|"catenations with other sensitive motions? Nor is this more extraordinary,"|FALSE
15707|"than that the catenations of irritative motions with the apparent"|FALSE
15707|"vibrations of objects at sea should produce sickness of the stomach; or"|FALSE
15707|"that a nauseous story should occasion vomiting."|FALSE
15707|"4. An argument, which evinces the effect of imagination on the first"|FALSE
15707|"rudiment of the embryon, may be deduced from the production of some"|FALSE
15707|"peculiar monsters. Such, for instance, as those which have two heads joined"|FALSE
15707|"to one body, and those which have two bodies joined to one head; of which"|FALSE
15707|"frequent examples occur amongst our domesticated quadrupeds, and poultry."|FALSE
15707|"It is absurd to suppose, that such forms could exist in primordial germs,"|FALSE
15707|"as explained in No. IV. 4. of this section. Nor is it possible, that such"|FALSE
15707|"deformities could be produced by the growth of two embryons, or living"|FALSE
15707|"filaments; which should afterwards adhere together; as the head and tail"|FALSE
15707|"part of different polypi are said to do (Blumenbach on Generation, Cadel,"|FALSE
15707|"London); since in that case one embryon, or living filament, must have"|FALSE
15707|"begun to form one part first, and the other another part first. But such"|FALSE
15707|"monstrous conformations become less difficult to comprehend, when they are"|FALSE
15707|"considered as an effect of the imagination, as before explained, on the"|FALSE
15707|"living filament at the time of its secretion; and that such duplicature of"|FALSE
15707|"limbs were produced by accretion of new parts, in consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"propensities, or animal appetencies thus acquired from the male parent."|FALSE
15707|"For instance, I can conceive, if a turkey-cock should behold a rabbit, or a"|FALSE
15707|"frog, at the time of procreation, that it might happen, that a forcible or"|FALSE
15707|"even a pleasurable idea of the form of a quadruped might so occupy his"|FALSE
15707|"imagination, as to cause a tendency in the nascent filament to resemble"|FALSE
15707|"such a form, by the apposition of a duplicature of limbs. Experiments on"|FALSE
15707|"the production of mules and monsters would be worthy the attention of a"|FALSE
15707|"Spallanzani, and might throw much light upon this subject, which at present"|FALSE
15707|"must be explained by conjectural analogies."|FALSE
15707|"The wonderful effect of imagination, both in the male and female parent, is"|FALSE
15707|"shewn in the production of a kind of milk in the crops both of the male and"|FALSE
15707|"female pigeons after the birth of their young, as observed by Mr. Hunter,"|FALSE
15707|"and mentioned before. To this should be added, that there are some"|FALSE
15707|"instances of men having had milk secreted in their breasts, and who have"|FALSE

15707|"attended to in very early times; Jacob is said not only to have placed rods"|FALSE

15707|"to have placed spotted lambs before the flocks, at the time of their"|FALSE
15707|"copulation. Genesis, chap. xxx. verse 40."|FALSE
15707|"5. In respect to the imagination of the mother, it is difficult to"|FALSE
15707|"comprehend, how this can produce any alteration in the fetus, except by"|FALSE
15707|"affecting the nutriment laid up for its first reception, as described in"|FALSE
15707|"No. V. 2. of this section, or by affecting the nourishment or oxygenation"|FALSE
15707|"with which she supplies it afterwards. Perpetual anxiety may probably"|FALSE
15707|"affect the secretion of the liquor amnii into the uterus, as it enfeebles"|FALSE
15707|"the whole system; and sudden fear is a frequent cause of miscarriage; for"|FALSE
15707|"fear, contrary to joy, decreases for a time the action of the extremities"|FALSE
15707|"of the arterial system; hence sudden paleness succeeds, and a shrinking or"|FALSE
15707|"contraction of the vessels of the skin, and other membranes. By this"|FALSE
15707|"circumstance, I imagine, the terminations of the placental vessels are"|FALSE
15707|"detached from their adhesions, or insertions, into the membrane of the"|FALSE
15707|"uterus; and the death of the child succeeds, and consequent miscarriage."|FALSE
15707|"Of this I recollect a remarkable instance, which could be ascribed to no"|FALSE
15707|"other cause, and which I shall therefore relate in few words. A healthy"|FALSE
15707|"young woman, about twenty years of age, had been about five months"|FALSE
15707|"pregnant, and going down into her cellar to draw some beer, was frighted by"|FALSE
15707|"a servant boy starting up from behind the barrel, where he had concealed"|FALSE
15707|"himself with design to alarm the maid-servant, for whom he mistook his"|FALSE
15707|"mistress. She came with difficulty up stairs, began to flood immediately,"|FALSE
15707|"and miscarried in a few hours. She has since borne several children, nor"|FALSE
15707|"ever had any tendency to miscarry of any of them."|FALSE
15707|"6. In respect to the power of the imagination of the male over the form,"|FALSE
15707|"colour, and sex of the progeny, the following instances have fallen under"|FALSE
15707|"my observation, and may perhaps be found not very unfrequent, if they were"|FALSE
15707|"more attended to. I am acquainted with a gentleman, who has one child with"|FALSE
15707|"dark hair and eyes, though his lady and himself have light hair and eyes;"|FALSE
15707|"and their other four children are like their parents. On observing this"|FALSE
15707|"dissimilarity of one child to the others he assured me, that he believed it"|FALSE
15707|"was his own imagination, that produced the difference; and related to me"|FALSE
15707|"the following story. He said, that when his lady lay in of her third child,"|FALSE
15707|"he became attached to a daughter of one of his inferior tenants, and"|FALSE
15707|"offered her a bribe for her favours in vain; and afterwards a greater"|FALSE
15707|"bribe, and was equally unsuccessful; that the form of this girl dwelt much"|FALSE
15707|"in his mind for some weeks, and that the next child, which was the"|FALSE
15707|"dark-ey'd young lady above mentioned, was exceedingly like, in both"|FALSE
15707|"features and colour, to the young woman who refused his addresses."|FALSE
15707|"To this instance I must add, that I have known two families, in which, on"|FALSE
15707|"account of an intailed estate in expectation, a male heir was most eagerly"|FALSE
15707|"desired by the father; and on the contrary, girls were produced to the"|FALSE
15707|"seventh in one, and to the ninth in another; and then they had each of them"|FALSE
15707|"a son. I conclude, that the great desire of a male heir by the father"|FALSE
15707|"produced rather a disagreeable than an agreeable sensation; and that his"|FALSE
15707|"ideas dwelt more on the fear of generating a female, than on the"|FALSE
15707|"pleasurable sensations or ideas of his own male form or organs at the time"|FALSE
15707|"of copulation, or of the secretion of the semen; and that hence the idea of"|FALSE
15707|"the female character was more present to his mind than that of the male"|FALSE
15707|"one; till at length in despair of generating a male these ideas ceased, and"|FALSE
15707|"those of the male character presided at the genial hour."|FALSE
15707|"7. Hence I conclude, that the act of generation cannot exist without being"|FALSE
15707|"accompanied with ideas, and that a man must have at that time either a"|FALSE
15707|"general idea of his own male form, or of the form of his male organs; or an"|FALSE
15707|"idea of the female form, or of her organs; and that this marks the sex, and"|FALSE
15707|"the peculiar resemblances of the child to either parent. From whence it"|FALSE
15707|"would appear, that the phalli, which were hung round the necks of the Roman"|FALSE
15707|"ladies, or worn in their hair, might have effect in producing a greater"|FALSE
15707|"proportion of male children; and that the calipædia, or art of begetting"|FALSE
15707|"beautiful children, and of procreating either males or females, may be"|FALSE
15707|"taught by affecting the imagination of the male-parent; that is, by the"|FALSE
15707|"fine extremities of the seminal glands, imitating the actions of the organs"|FALSE
15707|"of sense either of sight or touch. But the manner of accomplishing this"|FALSE
15707|"cannot be unfolded with sufficient delicacy for the public eye; but may be"|FALSE
15707|"worth the attention of those, who are seriously interested in the"|FALSE
15707|"procreation of a male or female child."|FALSE
15707|"_Recapitulation._"|FALSE
15707|"VII. 1. A certain quantity of nutritive particles are produced by the"|FALSE
15707|"female parent before impregnation, which require no further digestion,"|FALSE
15707|"secretion, or oxygenation. Such are seen in the unimpregnated eggs of"|FALSE
15707|"birds, and in the unimpregnated seed-vessels of vegetables."|FALSE
15707|"2. A living filament is produced by the male, which being inserted amidst"|FALSE
15707|"these first nutritive particles, is stimulated into action by them; and in"|FALSE
15707|"consequence of this action, some of the nutritive particles are embraced,"|FALSE
15707|"and added to the original living filament; in the same manner as common"|FALSE
15707|"nutrition is performed in the adult animal."|FALSE
15707|"3. Then this new organization, or additional part, becomes stimulated by"|FALSE
15707|"the nutritive particles in its vicinity, and sensation is now superadded to"|FALSE
15707|"irritation; and other particles are in consequence embraced, and added to"|FALSE
15707|"the living filament; as is seen in the new granulations of flesh in ulcers."|FALSE
15707|"By the power of association, or by irritation, the parts already produced"|FALSE
15707|"continue their motions, and new ones are added by sensation, as above"|FALSE
15707|"mentioned; and lastly by volition, which last sensorial power is proved to"|FALSE
15707|"exist in the fetus in its maturer age, because it has evidently periods of"|FALSE
15707|"activity and of sleeping; which last is another word for a temporary"|FALSE
15707|"suspension of volition."|FALSE
15707|"The original living filament may be conceived to possess a power of"|FALSE
15707|"repulsing the particles applied to certain parts of it, as well as of"|FALSE
15707|"embracing others, which stimulate other parts of it; as these powers exist"|FALSE
15707|"in different parts of the mature animal; thus the mouth of every gland"|FALSE
15707|"embraces the particles or fluid, which suits its appetency; and its"|FALSE
15707|"excretory duct repulses those particles, which are disagreeable to it."|FALSE
15707|"4. Thus the outline or miniature of the new animal is produced gradually,"|FALSE
15707|"but in no great length of time; because the original nutritive particles"|FALSE
15707|"require no previous preparation by digestion, secretion, and oxygenation:"|FALSE
15707|"but require simply the selection and apposition, which is performed by the"|FALSE
15707|"living filament. Mr. Blumenbach says, that he possesses a human fetus of"|FALSE
15707|"only five weeks old, which is the size of a common bee, and has all the"|FALSE
15707|"features of the face, every finger, and every toe, complete; and in which"|FALSE
15707|"the organs of generation are distinctly seen. P. 76. In another fetus,"|FALSE
15707|"whose head was not larger than a pea, the whole of the basis of the skull"|FALSE
15707|"with all its depressions, apertures, and processes, were marked in the most"|FALSE
15707|"sharp and distinct manner, though without any ossification. Ib."|FALSE
15707|"5. In some cases by the nutriment originally deposited by the mother the"|FALSE
15707|"filament acquires parts not exactly similar to those of the father, as in"|FALSE
15707|"the production of mules and mulattoes. In other cases, the deficiency of"|FALSE
15707|"this original nutriment causes deficiencies of the extreme parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"fetus, which are last formed, as the fingers, toes, lips. In other cases, a"|FALSE
15707|"duplicature of limbs are caused by the superabundance of this original"|FALSE
15707|"nutritive fluid, as in the double yolks of eggs, and the chickens from them"|FALSE
15707|"with four legs and four wings. But the production of other monsters, as"|FALSE
15707|"those with two heads, or with parts placed in wrong situations, seems to"|FALSE
15707|"arise from the imagination of the father being in some manner imitated by"|FALSE
15707|"the extreme vessels of the seminal glands; as the colours of the spots on"|FALSE
15707|"eggs, and the change of the colour of the hair and feathers of animals by"|FALSE
15707|"domestication, may be caused in the same manner by the imagination of the"|FALSE
15707|"mother."|FALSE
15707|"6. The living filament is a part of the father, and has therefore certain"|FALSE
15707|"propensities, or appetencies, which belong to him; which may have been"|FALSE
15707|"gradually acquired during a million of generations, even from the infancy"|FALSE
15707|"of the habitable earth; and which now possesses such properties, as would"|FALSE
15707|"render, by the apposition of nutritious particles, the new fetus exactly"|FALSE
15707|"similar to the father; as occurs in the buds and bulbs of vegetables, and"|FALSE
15707|"in the polypus, and tænia or tape-worm. But as the first nutriment is"|FALSE
15707|"supplied by the mother, and therefore resembles such nutritive particles,"|FALSE
15707|"as have been used for her own nutriment or growth, the progeny takes in"|FALSE
15707|"part of the likeness of the mother."|FALSE
15707|"Other similarity of the excitability, or of the form of the male parent,"|FALSE
15707|"such as the broad or narrow shoulders, or such as constitute certain"|FALSE
15707|"hereditary diseases, as scrophula, epilepsy, insanity, have their origin"|FALSE
15707|"produced in one or perhaps two generations; as in the progeny of those who"|FALSE
15707|"drink much vinous spirits; and those hereditary propensities cease again,"|FALSE
15707|"as I have observed, if one or two sober generations succeed; otherwise the"|FALSE
15707|"family becomes extinct."|FALSE
15707|"This living filament from the father is also liable to have its"|FALSE
15707|"propensities, or appetencies, altered at the time of its production by the"|FALSE
15707|"imagination of the male parent; the extremities of the seminal glands"|FALSE
15707|"imitating the motions of the organs of sense; and thus the sex of the"|FALSE
15707|"embryon is produced; which may be thus made a male or a female by affecting"|FALSE
15707|"the imagination of the father at the time of impregnation. See Sect. XXXIX."|FALSE
15707|"6. 3. and 7."|FALSE
15707|"7. After the fetus is thus completely formed together with its umbilical"|FALSE
15707|"vessels and placenta, it is now supplied with a different kind of food, as"|FALSE
15707|"appears by the difference of consistency of the different parts of the"|FALSE
15707|"white of the egg, and of the liquor amnii, for it has now acquired organs"|FALSE
15707|"for digestion or secretion, and for oxygenation, though they are as yet"|FALSE
15707|"feeble; which can in some degree change, as well as select, the nutritive"|FALSE
15707|"particles, which are now presented to it. But may yet be affected by the"|FALSE
15707|"deficiency of the quantity of nutrition supplied by the mother, or by the"|FALSE
15707|"degree of oxygenation supplied to its placenta by the maternal blood."|FALSE
15707|"The augmentation of the complete fetus by additional particles of nutriment"|FALSE
15707|"is not accomplished by distention only, but by apposition to every part"|FALSE
15707|"both external and internal; each of which acquires by animal appetencies"|FALSE
15707|"the new addition of the particles which it wants. And hence the enlarged"|FALSE
15707|"parts are kept similar to their prototypes, and may be said to be extended;"|FALSE
15707|"but their extension must be conceived only as a necessary consequence of"|FALSE
15707|"the enlargement of all their parts by apposition of new particles."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the new apposition of parts is not produced by capillary attraction,"|FALSE
15707|"because the whole is extended; whereas capillary attraction would rather"|FALSE
15707|"tend to bring the sides of flexible tubes together, and not to distend"|FALSE
15707|"them. Nor is it produced by chemical affinities, for then a solution of"|FALSE
15707|"continuity would succeed, as when sugar is dissolved in water; but it is"|FALSE
15707|"produced by an animal process, which is the consequence of irritation, or"|FALSE
15707|"sensation; and which may be termed animal appetency."|FALSE
15707|"This is further evinced from experiments, which have been instituted to"|FALSE
15707|"shew, that a living muscle of an animal body requires greater force to"|FALSE
15707|"break it, than a similar muscle of a dead body. Which evinces, that besides"|FALSE
15707|"the attraction of cohesion, which all matter possesses, and besides the"|FALSE
15707|"chemical attractions of affinities, which hold many bodies together, there"|FALSE
15707|"is an animal adhesion, which adds vigour to these common laws of the"|FALSE
15707|"inanimate world."|FALSE
15707|"8. At the nativity of the child it deposits the placenta or gills, and by"|FALSE
15707|"expanding its lungs acquires more plentiful oxygenation from the currents"|FALSE
15707|"of air, which it must now continue perpetually to respire to the end of its"|FALSE
15707|"life; as it now quits the liquid element, in which it was produced, and"|FALSE
15707|"like the tadpole, when it changes into a frog, becomes an aerial animal."|FALSE
15707|"9. As the habitable parts of the earth have been, and continue to be,"|FALSE
15707|"perpetually increasing by the production of sea-shells and corallines, and"|FALSE
15707|"by the recrements of other animals, and vegetables; so from the beginning"|FALSE
15707|"of the existence of this terraqueous globe, the animals, which inhabit it,"|FALSE
15707|"have constantly improved, and are still in a state of progressive"|FALSE
15707|"improvement."|FALSE
15707|"This idea of the gradual generation of all things seems to have been as"|FALSE
15707|"familiar to the ancient philosophers as to the modern ones; and to have"|FALSE
15707|"given rise to the beautiful hieroglyphic figure of the [Greek: proton ôon],"|FALSE
15707|"or first great egg, produced by NIGHT, that is, whose origin is involved in"|FALSE
15707|"obscurity, and animated by [Greek: eros], that is, by DIVINE LOVE; from"|FALSE
15707|"whence proceeded all things which exist."|FALSE
15707|"_Conclusion._"|FALSE
15707|"VIII. 1. Cause and effect may be considered as the progression, or"|FALSE
15707|"successive motions, of the parts of the great system of Nature. The state"|FALSE
15707|"of things at this moment is the effect of the state of things, which"|FALSE
15707|"existed in the preceding moment; and the cause of the state of things,"|FALSE
15707|"which shall exist in the next moment."|FALSE
15707|"These causes and effects may be more easily comprehended, if motion be"|FALSE
15707|"considered as a change of the figure of a group of bodies, as proposed in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. XIV. 2. 2. inasmuch as our ideas of visible or tangible objects are"|FALSE
15707|"more distinct, than our abstracted ideas of their motions. Now the change"|FALSE
15707|"of the configuration of the system of nature at this moment must be an"|FALSE
15707|"effect of the preceding configuration, for a change of configuration cannot"|FALSE
15707|"exist without a previous configuration; and the proximate cause of every"|FALSE
15707|"effect must immediately precede that effect. For example, a moving ivory"|FALSE
15707|"ball could not proceed onwards, unless it had previously began to proceed;"|FALSE
15707|"or unless an impulse had been previously given it; which previous motion or"|FALSE
15707|"impulse constitutes a part of the last situation of things."|FALSE
15707|"As the effects produced in this moment of time become causes in the next,"|FALSE
15707|"we may consider the progressive motions of objects as a chain of causes"|FALSE
15707|"only; whose first link proceeded from the great Creator, and which have"|FALSE
15707|"existed from the beginning of the created universe, and are perpetually"|FALSE
15707|"proceeding."|FALSE
15707|"2. These causes may be conveniently divided into two kinds, efficient and"|FALSE
15707|"inert causes, according with the two kinds of entity supposed to exist in"|FALSE
15707|"the natural world, which may be termed matter and spirit, as proposed in"|FALSE
15707|"Sect. I. and further treated of in Sect. XIV. The efficient causes of"|FALSE
15707|"motion, or new configuration, consist either of the principle of general"|FALSE
15707|"gravitation, which actuates the sun and planets; or of the principle of"|FALSE
15707|"particular gravitation, as in electricity, magnetism, heat; or of the"|FALSE
15707|"principle of chemical affinity, as in combustion, fermentation,"|FALSE
15707|"combination; or of the principle of organic life, as in the contraction of"|FALSE
15707|"vegetable and animal fibres. The inert causes of motion, or new"|FALSE
15707|"configuration, consist of the parts of matter, which are introduced within"|FALSE
15707|"the spheres of activity of the principles above described. Thus, when an"|FALSE
15707|"apple falls on the ground, the principle of gravitation is the efficient"|FALSE
15707|"cause, and the matter of the apple the inert cause. If a bar of iron be"|FALSE
15707|"approximated to a magnet, it may be termed the inert cause of the motion,"|FALSE
15707|"which brings these two bodies into contact; while the magnetic principle"|FALSE
15707|"may be termed the efficient cause. In the same manner the fibres, which"|FALSE
15707|"constitute the retina, may be called the inert cause of the motions of that"|FALSE
15707|"organ in vision, while the sensorial power may be termed the efficient"|FALSE
15707|"cause."|FALSE
15707|"3. Another more common distribution of the perpetual chain of causes and"|FALSE
15707|"effects, which constitute the motions, or changing configurations, of the"|FALSE
15707|"natural world, is into active and passive. Thus, if a ball in motion"|FALSE
15707|"impinges against another ball at rest, and communicates its motion to it,"|FALSE
15707|"the former ball is said to act, and the latter to be acted upon. In this"|FALSE
15707|"sense of the words a magnet is said to attract iron; and the prick of a"|FALSE
15707|"spur to stimulate a horse into exertion; so that in this view of the works"|FALSE
15707|"of nature all things may be said either simply to exist, or to exist as"|FALSE
15707|"causes, or to exist as effects; that is, to exist either in an active or"|FALSE
15707|"passive state."|FALSE
15707|"This distribution of objects, and their motions, or changes of position,"|FALSE
15707|"has been found so convenient for the purposes of common life, that on this"|FALSE
15707|"foundation rests the whole construction or theory of language. The names of"|FALSE
15707|"the things themselves are termed by grammarians Nouns, and their modes of"|FALSE
15707|"existence are termed Verbs. The nouns are divided into substantives, which"|FALSE
15707|"denote the principal things spoken of; and into adjectives, which denote"|FALSE
15707|"some circumstances, or less kinds of things, belonging to the former. The"|FALSE
15707|"verbs are divided into three kinds, such as denote the existence of things"|FALSE
15707|"simply, as, to be; or their existence in an active state, as, to eat; or"|FALSE
15707|"their existence in a passive state, as, to be eaten. Whence it appears,"|FALSE
15707|"that all languages consist only of nouns and verbs, with their"|FALSE
15707|"abbreviations for the greater expedition of communicating our thoughts; as"|FALSE
15707|"explained in the ingenious work of Mr. Horne Tooke, who has unfolded by a"|FALSE
15707|"single flash of light the whole theory of language, which had so long lain"|FALSE
15707|"buried beneath the learned lumber of the schools. Diversions of Purley."|FALSE
15707|"Johnson. London."|FALSE
15707|"4. A third division of causes has been into proximate and remote; these"|FALSE
15707|"have been much spoken of by the writers on medical subjects, but without"|FALSE
15707|"sufficient precision. If to proximate and remote causes we add proximate"|FALSE
15707|"and remote effects, we shall include four links of the perpetual chain of"|FALSE
15707|"causation; which will be more convenient for the discussion of many"|FALSE

15707|"resembling the shape of the sun, or other luminous object which we last"|FALSE
15707|"beheld. This is the source of one kind of the dark-coloured _muscæ"|FALSE

15707|"5. On emerging from a dark cavern, where we have long continued, the light"|FALSE
15707|"of a bright day becomes intolerable to the eye for a considerable time,"|FALSE
15707|"owing to the excess of sensibility existing in the eye, after having been"|FALSE

15707|"dilated, as the retina becomes accustomed to the greater stimulus of the"|FALSE
15707|"daylight."|FALSE
15707|"The twinkling of a bright star, or of a distant candle in the night, is"|FALSE
15707|"perhaps owing to the same cause. While we continue to look upon these"|FALSE

15707|"whilst, at the same time, by the unsteadiness of the eye, the edges of them"|FALSE
15707|"are perpetually falling on parts of the retina that were just before"|FALSE
15707|"exposed to the darkness of the night, and therefore tenfold more sensible"|FALSE
15707|"to light than the part on which the star or candle had been for some time"|FALSE
15707|"delineated. This pains the eye in a similar manner as when we come suddenly"|FALSE
15707|"from a dark room into bright daylight, and gives the appearance of bright"|FALSE
15707|"scintillations. Hence the stars twinkle most when the night is darkest, and"|FALSE
15707|"do not twinkle through telescopes, as observed by Musschenbroeck; and it"|FALSE
15707|"will afterwards be seen why this twinkling is sometimes of different"|FALSE

15707|"with this additional circumstance, that when the spectrum becomes faint or"|FALSE

15707|"There were some circumstances occurred in making these experiments, which"|FALSE

15707|"for the assistance of others, who may wish to repeat them."|FALSE
15707|"1. _Of direct and inverse spectra existing at the same time_; _of"|FALSE
15707|"reciprocal direct spectra_; _of a combination of direct and inverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectra_; _of a spectral halo_; _rules to pre-determine the colours of"|FALSE
15707|"spectra_."|FALSE
15707|"a. When an area, about six inches square, of bright pink Indian paper, had"|FALSE
15707|"been viewed on an area, about a foot square, of white writing paper, the"|FALSE
15707|"internal spectrum in the closed eye was green, being the reverse spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"of the pink paper; and the external spectrum was pink, being the direct"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of the pink paper. The same circumstance happened when the"|FALSE
15707|"internal area was white, and external one pink; that is, the internal"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum was pink, and the external one green. All the same appearances"|FALSE
15707|"occurred when the pink paper was laid on a black hat."|FALSE
15707|"b. When six inches square of deep violet polished paper was viewed on a"|FALSE
15707|"foot square of white writing paper, the internal spectrum was yellow, being"|FALSE
15707|"the reverse spectrum of the violet paper, and the external one was violet,"|FALSE
15707|"being the direct spectrum of the violet paper."|FALSE
15707|"c. When six inches square of pink paper was viewed on a foot square of blue"|FALSE
15707|"paper, the internal spectrum was blue, and the external spectrum was pink;"|FALSE
15707|"that is, the internal one was the direct spectrum of the external object,"|FALSE
15707|"and the external one was the direct spectrum of the internal object,"|FALSE
15707|"instead of their being each the reverse spectrum of the objects they"|FALSE
15707|"belonged to."|FALSE
15707|"d. When six inches square of blue paper were viewed on a foot square of"|FALSE
15707|"yellow paper, the interior spectrum became a brilliant yellow, and the"|FALSE
15707|"exterior one a brilliant blue. The vivacity of the spectra was owing to"|FALSE
15707|"their being excited both by the stimulus of the interior and exterior"|FALSE
15707|"objects; so that the interior yellow spectrum was both the reverse spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"of the blue paper, and the direct one of the yellow paper; and the exterior"|FALSE
15707|"blue spectrum was both the reverse spectrum of the yellow paper, and the"|FALSE
15707|"direct one of the blue paper."|FALSE
15707|"e. When the internal area was only a square half-inch of red paper, laid on"|FALSE
15707|"a square foot of dark violet paper, the internal spectrum was green, with a"|FALSE
15707|"reddish-blue halo. When the red internal paper was two inches square, the"|FALSE
15707|"internal spectrum was a deeper green, and the external one redder. When the"|FALSE
15707|"internal paper was six inches square, the spectrum of it became blue, and"|FALSE

15707|"f. When a square half-inch of blue paper was laid on a six-inch square of"|FALSE
15707|"yellow paper, the spectrum of the central paper in the closed eye was"|FALSE
15707|"yellow, incircled with a blue halo. On looking long on the meridian sun,"|FALSE
15707|"the disk fades into a pale blue surrounded with a whitish halo."|FALSE
15707|"These circumstances, though they very much perplexed the experiments till"|FALSE
15707|"they were investigated, admit of a satisfactory explanation; for while the"|FALSE
15707|"rays from the bright internal object in exp. a. fall with their full force"|FALSE
15707|"on the center of the retina, and, by fatiguing that part of it, induce the"|FALSE
15707|"reverse spectrum, many scattered rays, from the same internal pink paper,"|FALSE
15707|"fall on the more external parts of the retina, but not in such quantity as"|FALSE
15707|"to occasion much fatigue, and hence induce the direct spectrum of the pink"|FALSE
15707|"colour in those parts of the eye. The same reverse and direct spectra occur"|FALSE
15707|"from the violet paper in exp. b.: and in exp. c. the scattered rays from"|FALSE
15707|"the central pink paper produce a direct spectrum of this colour on the"|FALSE
15707|"external parts of the eye, while the scattered rays from the external blue"|FALSE
15707|"paper produce a direct spectrum of that colour on the central part of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye, instead of these parts of the retina falling reciprocally into their"|FALSE
15707|"reverse spectra. In exp. d. the colours being the reverse of each other,"|FALSE

15707|"the retina was excited into a reverse spectrum by the central object, and"|FALSE
15707|"this direct and reverse spectrum being of similar colour, the superior"|FALSE
15707|"brilliancy of this spectrum was produced. In exp. e. the effect of various"|FALSE
15707|"quantities of stimulus on the retina, from the different respective sizes"|FALSE
15707|"of the internal and external areas, induced a spectrum of the internal area"|FALSE
15707|"in the center of the eye, combined of the reverse spectrum of that internal"|FALSE
15707|"area and the direct one of the external area, in various shades of colour,"|FALSE
15707|"from a pale green to a deep blue, with similar changes in the spectrum of"|FALSE
15707|"the external area. For the same reasons, when an internal bright object was"|FALSE
15707|"small, as in exp. f. instead of the whole of the spectrum of the external"|FALSE
15707|"object being reverse to the colour of the internal object, only a kind of"|FALSE
15707|"halo, or radiation of colour, similar to that of the internal object, was"|FALSE
15707|"spread a little way on the external spectrum. For this internal blue area"|FALSE
15707|"being so small, the scattered rays from it extended but a little way on the"|FALSE
15707|"image of the external area of yellow paper, and could therefore produce"|FALSE
15707|"only a blue halo round the yellow spectrum in the center."|FALSE
15707|"If any one should suspect that the scattered rays from the exterior"|FALSE
15707|"coloured object do not intermix with the rays from the interior coloured"|FALSE
15707|"object, and thus affect the central part of the eye, let him look through"|FALSE
15707|"an opake tube, about two feet in length, and an inch in diameter, at a"|FALSE
15707|"coloured wall of a room with one eye, and with the other eye naked; and he"|FALSE
15707|"will find, that by shutting out the lateral light, the area of the wall"|FALSE
15707|"seen through a tube appears as if illuminated by the sunshine, compared"|FALSE
15707|"with the other parts of it; from whence arises the advantage of looking"|FALSE
15707|"through a dark tube at distant paintings."|FALSE
15707|"Hence we may safely deduce the following rules to determine before-hand the"|FALSE
15707|"colours of all spectra. 1. The direct spectrum without any lateral light is"|FALSE
15707|"an evanescent representation of its object in the unfatigued eye. 2. With"|FALSE
15707|"some lateral light it becomes of a colour combined of the direct spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"of the central object, and of the circumjacent objects, in proportion to"|FALSE
15707|"their respective quantity and brilliancy. 3. The reverse spectrum without"|FALSE
15707|"lateral light is a representation in the fatigued eye of the form of its"|FALSE
15707|"objects, with such a colour as would be produced by all the primary"|FALSE
15707|"colours, except that of the object. 4. With lateral light the colour is"|FALSE
15707|"compounded of the reverse spectrum of the central object, and the direct"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of the circumjacent objects, in proportion to their respective"|FALSE
15707|"quantity and brilliancy."|FALSE
15707|"2. _Variation and vivacity of the spectra occasioned by extraneous light._"|FALSE
15707|"The reverse spectrum, as has been before explained, is similar to a colour,"|FALSE
15707|"formed by a combination of all the primary colours, except that with which"|FALSE
15707|"the eye has been fatigued in making the experiment: so the reverse spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"of red is such a green as would be produced by a combination of all the"|FALSE
15707|"other prismatic colours. Now it must be observed, that this reverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of red is therefore the direct spectrum of a combination of all"|FALSE
15707|"the other prismatic colours, except the red; whence, on removing the eye"|FALSE
15707|"from a piece of red silk to a sheet of white paper, the green spectrum,"|FALSE
15707|"which is perceived, may either be called the reverse spectrum of the red"|FALSE
15707|"silk, or the direct spectrum of all the rays from the white paper, except"|FALSE
15707|"the red; for in truth it is both. Hence we see the reason why it is not"|FALSE
15707|"easy to gain a direct spectrum of any coloured object in the day-time,"|FALSE
15707|"where there is much lateral light, except of very bright objects, as of the"|FALSE
15707|"setting sun, or by looking through an opake tube; because the lateral"|FALSE
15707|"external light falling also on the central part of the retina, contributes"|FALSE
15707|"to induce the reverse spectrum, which is at the same time the direct"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of that lateral light, deducting only the colour of the central"|FALSE
15707|"object which we have been viewing. And for the same reason, it is difficult"|FALSE
15707|"to gain the reverse spectrum, where there is no lateral light to contribute"|FALSE
15707|"to its formation. Thus, in looking through an opake tube on a yellow wall,"|FALSE
15707|"and closing my eye, without admitting any lateral light, the spectra were"|FALSE
15707|"all at first yellow; but at length changed into blue. And on looking in the"|FALSE
15707|"same manner on red paper, I did at length get a green spectrum; but they"|FALSE
15707|"were all at first red ones: and the same after looking at a candle in the"|FALSE
15707|"night."|FALSE
15707|"The reverse spectrum was formed with greater facility when the eye was"|FALSE
15707|"thrown from the object on a sheet of white paper, or when light was"|FALSE
15707|"admitted through the closed eyelids; because not only the fatigued part of"|FALSE
15707|"the retina was inclined spontaneously to fall into motions of a contrary"|FALSE
15707|"direction; but being still sensible to all other rays of light except that"|FALSE
15707|"with which it was lately fatigued, was by these rays stimulated at the same"|FALSE
15707|"time into those motions which form the reverse spectrum. Hence, when, the"|FALSE
15707|"reverse spectrum of any colour became faint, it was wonderfully revived by"|FALSE
15707|"admitting more light through the eyelids, by removing the hand from before"|FALSE
15707|"them: and hence, on covering the closed eyelids, the spectrum would often"|FALSE
15707|"cease for a time, till the retina became sensible to the stimulus of the"|FALSE
15707|"smaller quantity of light, and then it recurred. Nor was the spectrum only"|FALSE
15707|"changed in vivacity, or in degree, by this admission of light through the"|FALSE
15707|"eyelids; but it frequently happened, after having viewed bright objects,"|FALSE
15707|"that the spectrum in the closed and covered eye was changed into a third"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum, when light was admitted through the eyelids: which third spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"was composed of such colours as could pass through the eyelids, except"|FALSE
15707|"those of the object. Thus, when an area of half an inch diameter of pink"|FALSE
15707|"paper was viewed on a sheet of white paper in the sunshine, the spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"with closed and covered eyes was green; but on removing the hands from"|FALSE
15707|"before the closed eyelids, the spectrum became yellow, and returned"|FALSE
15707|"instantly again to green, as often as the hands were applied to cover the"|FALSE
15707|"eyelids, or removed from them: for the retina being now insensible to red"|FALSE
15707|"light, the yellow rays passing through the eyelids in greater quantity than"|FALSE
15707|"the other colours, induced a yellow spectrum; whereas if the spectrum was"|FALSE
15707|"thrown on white paper, with the eyes open, it became only a lighter green."|FALSE
15707|"Though a certain quantity of light facilitates the formation of the reverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum, a greater quantity prevents its formation, as the more powerful"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus excites even the fatigued parts of the eye into action; otherwise"|FALSE
15707|"we should see the spectrum of the last viewed object as often as we turn"|FALSE
15707|"our eyes. Hence the reverse spectra are best seen by gradually approaching"|FALSE
15707|"the hand near the closed eyelids to a certain distance only, which must be"|FALSE
15707|"varied with the brightness of the day, or the energy of the spectrum. Add"|FALSE
15707|"to this, that all dark spectra, as black, blue, or green, if light be"|FALSE
15707|"admitted through the eyelids, after they have been some time covered, give"|FALSE
15707|"reddish spectra, for the reasons given in Sect. III. Exp. 1."|FALSE
15707|"From these circumstances of the extraneous light coinciding with the"|FALSE
15707|"spontaneous efforts of the fatigued retina to produce a reverse spectrum,"|FALSE
15707|"as was observed before, it is not easy to gain a direct spectrum, except of"|FALSE
15707|"objects brighter than the ambient light; such as a candle in the night, the"|FALSE
15707|"setting sun, or viewing a bright object through an opake tube; and then the"|FALSE
15707|"reverse spectrum is instantaneously produced by the admission of some"|FALSE
15707|"external light; and is as instantly converted again to the direct spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"by the exclusion of it. Thus, on looking at the setting sun, on closing the"|FALSE
15707|"eyes, and covering them, a yellow spectrum is seen, which is the direct"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of the setting sun; but on opening the eyes on the sky, the yellow"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum is immediately changed into a blue one, which is the reverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of the yellow sun, or the direct spectrum of the blue sky, or a"|FALSE
15707|"combination of both. And this is again transformed into a yellow one on"|FALSE
15707|"closing the eyes, and so reciprocally, as quick as the motions of the"|FALSE
15707|"opening and closing eyelids. Hence, when Mr. Melvill observed the"|FALSE
15707|"scintillations of the star Sirius to be sometimes coloured, these were"|FALSE
15707|"probably the direct spectrum of the blue sky on the parts of the retina"|FALSE
15707|"fatigued by the white light of the star. (Essays Physical and Literary, p."|FALSE
15707|"81. V. 2.)"|FALSE
15707|"When a direct spectrum is thrown on colours darker than itself, it mixes"|FALSE
15707|"with them; as the yellow spectrum of the setting sun, thrown on the green"|FALSE
15707|"grass, becomes a greener yellow. But when a direct spectrum is thrown on"|FALSE
15707|"colours brighter than itself, it becomes instantly changed into the reverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum, which mixes with those brighter colours. So the yellow spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"of the setting sun thrown on the luminous sky becomes blue, and changes"|FALSE
15707|"with the colour or brightness of the clouds on which it appears. But the"|FALSE
15707|"reverse spectrum mixes with every kind of colour on which it is thrown,"|FALSE
15707|"whether brighter than itself or not; thus the reverse spectrum, obtained by"|FALSE
15707|"viewing a piece of yellow silk, when thrown on white paper, was a lucid"|FALSE
15707|"blue green; when thrown on black Turkey leather, becomes a deep violet. And"|FALSE
15707|"the spectrum of blue silk, thrown on white paper, was a light yellow; on"|FALSE
15707|"black silk was an obscure orange; and, the blue spectrum, obtained from"|FALSE
15707|"orange-coloured silk, thrown on yellow, became a green."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the retina is thrown into activity or sensation by the"|FALSE
15707|"stimulus of external colours, at the same time that it continues the"|FALSE
15707|"activity or sensation which forms the spectra; in the same manner as the"|FALSE
15707|"prismatic colours, painted on a whirling top, are seen to mix together."|FALSE
15707|"When these colours of external objects are brighter than the direct"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum which is thrown upon them, they change it into the reverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum, like the admission of external light on a direct spectrum, as"|FALSE
15707|"explained above. When they are darker than the direct spectrum, they mix"|FALSE
15707|"with it, their weaker stimulus being inefficient to induce the reverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum."|FALSE
15707|"3. _Variation of spectra in respect to number, and figure, and remission._"|FALSE
15707|"[Illustration: Fig. 4.]"|FALSE
15707|"When we look long and attentively at any object, the eye cannot always be"|FALSE
15707|"kept entirely motionless; hence, on inspecting a circular area of red silk"|FALSE
15707|"placed on white paper, a lucid crescent or edge is seen to librate on one"|FALSE
15707|"side or other of the red circle: for the exterior parts of the retina"|FALSE
15707|"sometimes falling on the edge of the central silk, and sometimes on the"|FALSE
15707|"white paper, are less fatigued with red light than the central part of the"|FALSE
15707|"retina, which is constantly, exposed to it; and therefore, when they fall"|FALSE
15707|"on the edge of the red silk, they perceive it more vividly. Afterwards,"|FALSE
15707|"when the eye becomes fatigued, a green spectrum in the form of a crescent"|FALSE
15707|"is seen to librate on one side or other of the central circle, as by the"|FALSE
15707|"unsteadiness of the eye a part of the fatigued retina falls on the white"|FALSE
15707|"paper; and as by the increasing fatigue of the eye the central part of the"|FALSE
15707|"silk appears paler, the edge on which the unfatigued part of the retina"|FALSE
15707|"occasionally falls will appear of a deeper red than the original silk,"|FALSE
15707|"because it is compared with the pale internal part of it. M. de Buffon in"|FALSE
15707|"making this experiment observed, that the red edge of the silk was not only"|FALSE
15707|"deeper coloured than the original silk; but, on his retreating a little"|FALSE
15707|"from it, it became oblong, and at length divided into two, which must have"|FALSE
15707|"been owing to his observing it either before or behind the point of"|FALSE
15707|"intersection of the two optic axises. Thus, if a pen is held up before a"|FALSE
15707|"distant candle, when we look intensely at the pen two candles are seen"|FALSE
15707|"behind it; when we look intensely at the candle two pens are seen. If the"|FALSE
15707|"sight be unsteady at the time of beholding the sun, even though one eye"|FALSE
15707|"only be used, many images of the sun will appear, or luminous lines, when"|FALSE
15707|"the eye is closed. And as some parts of these will be more vivid than"|FALSE
15707|"others, and some parts of them will be produced nearer the center of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye than others, these will disappear sooner than the others; and hence the"|FALSE
15707|"number and shape of these spectra of the sun will continually vary, as long"|FALSE
15707|"as they exist. The cause of some being more vivid than others, is the"|FALSE
15707|"unsteadiness of the eye of the beholder, so that some parts of the retina"|FALSE
15707|"have been longer exposed to the sunbeams. That some parts of a complicated"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum fade and return before other parts of it, the following experiment"|FALSE
15707|"evinces. Draw three concentric circles; the external one an inch and a half"|FALSE
15707|"in diameter, the middle one an inch, and the internal one half an inch;"|FALSE
15707|"colour the external and internal areas blue, and the remaining one yellow,"|FALSE
15707|"as in Fig. 4.; after having looked about a minute on the center of these"|FALSE
15707|"circles, in a bright light, the spectrum of the external area appears first"|FALSE
15707|"in the closed eye, then the middle area, and lastly the central one; and"|FALSE
15707|"then the central one disappears, and the others in inverted order. If"|FALSE
15707|"concentric circles of more colours are added, it produces the beautiful"|FALSE
15707|"ever changing spectrum in Sect. I. Exp. 2."|FALSE
15707|"From hence it would seem, that the center of the eye produces quicker"|FALSE
15707|"remissions of spectra, owing perhaps to its greater sensibility; that is,"|FALSE
15707|"to its more energetic exertions. These remissions of spectra bear some"|FALSE
15707|"analogy to the tremors of the hands, and palpitations of the heart, of weak"|FALSE
15707|"people: and perhaps a criterion of the strength of any muscle or nerve may"|FALSE
15707|"be taken from the time it can be continued in exertion."|FALSE
15707|"4. _Variation of spectra in respect to brilliancy; the visibility of the"|FALSE
15707|"circulation of the blood in the eye._"|FALSE
15707|"1. The meridian or evening light makes a difference in the colours of some"|FALSE
15707|"spectra; for as the sun descends, the red rays, which are less refrangible"|FALSE
15707|"by the convex atmosphere, abound in great quantity. Whence the spectrum of"|FALSE
15707|"the light parts of a window at this time, or early in the morning, is red;"|FALSE
15707|"and becomes blue either a little later or earlier; and white in the"|FALSE
15707|"meridian day; and is also variable from the colour of the clouds or sky"|FALSE
15707|"which are opposed to the window."|FALSE
15707|"2. All these experiments are liable to be confounded, if they are made too"|FALSE
15707|"soon after each other, as the remaining spectrum will mix with the new"|FALSE
15707|"ones. This is a very troublesome circumstance to painters, who are obliged"|FALSE
15707|"to look long upon the same colour; and in particular to those whose eyes,"|FALSE
15707|"from natural debility, cannot long, continue the same kind of exertion. For"|FALSE
15707|"the same reason, in making these experiments, the result becomes much"|FALSE
15707|"varied if the eyes, after viewing any object, are removed on other objects"|FALSE
15707|"for but an instant of time, before we close them to view the spectrum; for"|FALSE
15707|"the light from the object, of which we had only a transient view, in the"|FALSE
15707|"very time of closing our eyes acts as a stimulus on the fatigued retina;"|FALSE
15707|"and for a time prevents the defined spectrum from appearing, or mixes its"|FALSE
15707|"own spectrum with it. Whence, after the eyelids are closed, either a dark"|FALSE
15707|"field, or some unexpected colours, are beheld for a few seconds, before the"|FALSE
15707|"desired spectrum becomes distinctly visible."|FALSE
15707|"3. The length of time taken up in viewing an object, of which we are to"|FALSE
15707|"observe the spectrum, makes a great difference in the appearance of the"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum, not only in its vivacity, but in its colour; as the direct"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of the central object, or of the circumjacent ones, and also the"|FALSE
15707|"reverse spectra of both, with their various combinations, as well as the"|FALSE
15707|"time of their duration in the eye, and of their remissions or alternations,"|FALSE
15707|"depend upon the degree of fatigue the retina is subjected to. The Chevalier"|FALSE
15707|"d'Arcy constructed a machine by which a coal of fire was whirled round in"|FALSE
15707|"the dark, and found, that when a luminous body made a revolution in eight"|FALSE
15707|"thirds of time, it presented to the eye a complete circle of fire; from"|FALSE
15707|"whence he concludes, that the impression continues on the organ about the"|FALSE
15707|"seventh part of a second. (Mem. de l'Acad. des Sc. 1765.) This, however, is"|FALSE
15707|"only to be considered as the shortest time of the duration of these direct"|FALSE
15707|"spectra; since in the fatigued eye both the direct and reverse spectra,"|FALSE
15707|"with their intermissions, appear to take up many seconds of time, and seem"|FALSE
15707|"very variable in proportion to the circumstances of fatigue or energy."|FALSE
15707|"4. It sometimes happens, if the eyeballs have been rubbed hard with the"|FALSE
15707|"fingers, that lucid sparks are seen in quick motion amidst the spectrum we"|FALSE
15707|"are attending to. This is similar to the flashes of fire from a stroke on"|FALSE
15707|"the eye in fighting, and is resembled by the warmth and glow, which appears"|FALSE
15707|"upon the skin after friction, and is probably owing to an acceleration of"|FALSE
15707|"the arterial blood into the vessels emptied by the previous pressure. By"|FALSE
15707|"being accustomed to observe such small sensations in the eye, it is easy to"|FALSE
15707|"see the circulation of the blood in this organ. I have attended to this"|FALSE
15707|"frequently, when I have observed my eyes more than commonly sensible to"|FALSE
15707|"other spectra. The circulation may be seen either in both eyes at a time,"|FALSE
15707|"or only in one of them; for as a certain quantity of light is necessary to"|FALSE
15707|"produce this curious phenomenon, if one hand be brought nearer the closed"|FALSE
15707|"eyelids than the other, the circulation in that eye will for a time"|FALSE
15707|"disappear. For the easier viewing the circulation, it is sometimes"|FALSE
15707|"necessary to rub the eyes with a certain degree of force after they are"|FALSE
15707|"closed, and to hold the breath rather longer than is agreeable, which, by"|FALSE
15707|"accumulating more blood in the eye, facilitates the experiment; but in"|FALSE
15707|"general it may be seen distinctly after having examined other spectra with"|FALSE
15707|"your back to the light, till the eyes become weary; then having covered"|FALSE
15707|"your closed eyelids for half a minute, till the spectrum is faded away"|FALSE
15707|"which you were examining, turn your face to the light, and removing your"|FALSE
15707|"hands from the eyelids, by and by again shade them a little, and the"|FALSE
15707|"circulation becomes curiously distinct. The streams of blood are however"|FALSE
15707|"generally seen to unite, which shews it to be the venous circulation,"|FALSE
15707|"owing, I suppose, to the greater opacity of the colour of the blood in"|FALSE
15707|"these vessels; for this venous circulation is also much more easily seen by"|FALSE
15707|"the microscope in the tail of a tadpole."|FALSE
15707|"5. _Variation of spectra in respect to distinctness and size; with a new"|FALSE
15707|"way of magnifying objects._"|FALSE
15707|"1. It was before observed, that when the two colours viewed together were"|FALSE
15707|"opposite to each other, as yellow and blue, red and green, &c. according to"|FALSE
15707|"the table of reflections and transmissions of light in Sir Isaac Newton's"|FALSE
15707|"Optics, B. II. Fig. 3. the spectra of those colours were of all others the"|FALSE
15707|"most brilliant, and best defined; because they were combined of the reverse"|FALSE
15707|"spectrum of one colour, and of the direct spectrum of the other. Hence, in"|FALSE
15707|"books printed with small types, or in the minute graduation of"|FALSE
15707|"thermometers, or of clock-faces, which are to be seen at a distance, if the"|FALSE
15707|"letters or figures are coloured with orange, and the ground with indigo; or"|FALSE
15707|"the letters with red, and the ground with green; or any other lucid colour"|FALSE
15707|"is used for the letters, the spectrum of which is similar to the colour of"|FALSE
15707|"the ground; such letters will be seen much more distinctly, and with less"|FALSE
15707|"confusion, than in black or white: for as the spectrum of the letter is the"|FALSE
15707|"same colour with the ground on which they are seen, the unsteadiness of the"|FALSE
15707|"eye in long attending to them will not produce coloured lines by the edges"|FALSE
15707|"of the letters, which is the principal cause of their confusion. The beauty"|FALSE
15707|"of colours lying in vicinity to each other, whose spectra are thus"|FALSE
15707|"reciprocally similar to each colour, is owing to this greater ease that the"|FALSE
15707|"eye experiences in beholding them distinctly; and it is probable, in the"|FALSE
15707|"organ of hearing, a similar circumstance may constitute the pleasure of"|FALSE
15707|"melody. Sir Isaac Newton observes, that gold and indigo were agreeable when"|FALSE
15707|"viewed together; and thinks there may be some analogy between the"|FALSE
15707|"sensations of light and sound. (Optics, Qu. 14.)"|FALSE
15707|"In viewing the spectra of bright objects, as of an area of red silk of half"|FALSE
15707|"an inch diameter on white paper, it is easy to magnify it to tenfold its"|FALSE
15707|"size: for if, when the spectrum is formed, you still keep your eye fixed on"|FALSE
15707|"the silk area, and remove it a few inches further from you, a green circle"|FALSE
15707|"is seen round the red silk: for the angle now subtended by the silk is less"|FALSE
15707|"than it was when the spectrum was formed, but that of the spectrum"|FALSE
15707|"continues the same, and our imagination places them at the same distance."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when you view a spectrum on a sheet of white paper, if you approach"|FALSE
15707|"the paper to the eye, you may diminish it to a point; and if the paper is"|FALSE
15707|"made to recede from the eye, the spectrum will appear magnified in"|FALSE
15707|"proportion to the distance."|FALSE
15707|"[Illustration: Fig. 5.]"|FALSE
15707|"I was surprised, and agreeably amused, with the following experiment. I"|FALSE
15707|"covered a paper about four inches square with yellow, and with a pen filled"|FALSE
15707|"with a blue colour wrote upon the middle of it the word BANKS in capitals,"|FALSE
15707|"as in Fig. 5, and sitting with my back to the sun, fixed my eyes for a"|FALSE
15707|"minute exactly on the center of the letter N in the middle of the word;"|FALSE
15707|"after closing my eyes, and shading them somewhat with my hand, the word was"|FALSE
15707|"distinctly seen in the spectrum in yellow letters on a blue field; and"|FALSE
15707|"then, on opening my eyes on a yellowish wall at twenty feet distance, the"|FALSE
15707|"magnified name of BANKS appeared written on the wall in golden characters."|FALSE
15707|"_Conclusion._"|FALSE
15707|"It was observed by the learned M. Sauvage (Nosol. Method. Cl. VIII. Ord."|FALSE
15707|"i.) that the pulsations of the optic artery might be perceived by looking"|FALSE
15707|"attentively on a white wall well illuminated. A kind of net-work, darker"|FALSE
15707|"than the other parts of the wall, appears and vanishes alternately with"|FALSE
15707|"every pulsation. This change of the colour of the wall he well ascribes to"|FALSE
15707|"the compression of the retina by the diastole of the artery. The various"|FALSE
15707|"colours produced in the eye by the pressure of the finger, or by a stroke"|FALSE
15707|"on it, as mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton, seem likewise to originate from"|FALSE
15707|"the unequal pressure on various parts of the retina. Now as Sir Isaac"|FALSE
