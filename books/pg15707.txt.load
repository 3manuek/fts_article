15707|"  HAIL TO THE BARD! who sung, from Chaos hurl'd  How suns and planets form'd the whirling world;  How sphere on sphere Earth's hidden strata bend,  And caves of rock her central fires defend;  Where gems new-born their twinkling eyes unfold,               5  And young ores shoot in arborescent gold.    How the fair Flower, by Zephyr woo'd, unfurls  Its panting leaves, and waves its azure curls;  Or spreads in gay undress its lucid form  To meet the sun, and shuts it to the storm;                   10  While in green veins impassion'd eddies move,  And Beauty kindles into life and love.    How the first embryon-fibre, sphere, or cube,  Lives in new forms,--a line,--a ring,--a tube;  Closed in the womb with limbs unfinish'd laves,               15  Sips with rude mouth the salutary waves;  Seeks round its cell the sanguine streams, that pass,  And drinks with crimson gills the vital gas;  Weaves with soft threads the blue meandering vein,  The heart's red concave, and the silver brain;                20  Leads the long nerve, expands the impatient sense,  And clothes in silken skin the nascent Ens.    Erewhile, emerging from its liquid bed,  It lifts in gelid air its nodding head;  The lights first dawn with trembling eyelid hails,            25  With lungs untaught arrests the balmy gales;  Tries its new tongue in tones unknown, and hears  The strange vibrations with unpractised ears;  Seeks with spread hands the bosom's velvet orbs.  With closing lips the milky fount absorbs;                    30  And, as compress'd the dulcet streams distil,  Drinks warmth and fragrance from the living rill;--  Eyes with mute rapture every waving line,  Prints with adoring kiss the Paphian shrine,  And learns erelong, the perfect form confess'd,               35  Ideal Beauty from its mother's breast.    Now in strong lines, with bolder tints design'd,  You sketch ideas, and portray the mind;  Teach how fine atoms of impinging light  To ceaseless change the visual sense excite;                  40  While the bright lens collects the rays, that swerve,  And bends their focus on the moving nerve.  How thoughts to thoughts are link'd with viewless chains,  Tribes leading tribes, and trains pursuing trains;  With shadowy trident how Volition guides,                     45  Surge after surge, his intellectual tides;  Or, Queen of Sleep, Imagination roves  With frantic Sorrows, or delirious Loves.    Go on, O FRIEND! explore with eagle-eye;  Where wrapp'd in night retiring Causes lie:                   50  Trace their slight bands, their secret haunts betray,  And give new wonders to the beam of day;  Till, link by link with step aspiring trod,  You climb from NATURE to the throne of GOD.  --So saw the Patriarch with admiring eyes                     55  From earth to heaven a golden ladder rise;  Involv'd in clouds the mystic scale ascends,  And brutes and angels crowd the distant ends."|FALSE

15707|"The purport of the following pages is an endeavour to reduce the factsbelonging to ANIMAL LIFE into classes, orders, genera, and species; and, bycomparing them with each other, to unravel the theory of diseases. Ithappened, perhaps unfortunately for the inquirers into the knowledge ofdiseases, that other sciences had received improvement previous to theirown; whence, instead of comparing the properties belonging to animatednature with each other, they, idly ingenious, busied themselves inattempting to explain the laws of life by those of mechanism and chemistry;they considered the body as an hydraulic machine, and the fluids as passingthrough a series of chemical changes, forgetting that animation was itsessential characteristic."|FALSE
15707|"The great CREATOR of all things has infinitely diversified the works of hishands, but has at the same time stamped a certain similitude on thefeatures of nature, that demonstrates to us, that _the whole is one familyof one parent_. On this similitude is founded all rational analogy; which,so long as it is concerned in comparing the essential properties of bodies,leads us to many and important discoveries; but when with licentiousactivity it links together objects, otherwise discordant, by some fancifulsimilitude; it may indeed collect ornaments for wit and poetry, butphilosophy and truth recoil from its combinations."|FALSE
15707|"The want of a theory, deduced from such strict analogy, to conduct thepractice of medicine is lamented by its professors; for, as a great numberof unconnected facts are difficult to be acquired, and to be reasoned from,the art of medicine is in many instances less efficacious under thedirection of its wisest practitioners; and by that busy crowd, who eitherboldly wade in darkness, or are led into endless error by the glare offalse theory, it is daily practised to the destruction of thousands; add tothis the unceasing injury which accrues to the public by the perpetualadvertisements of pretended nostrums; the minds of the indolent becomesuperstitiously fearful of diseases, which they do not labour under; andthus become the daily prey of some crafty empyric."|FALSE
15707|"A theory founded upon nature, that should bind together the scattered factsof medical knowledge, and converge into one point of view the laws oforganic life, would thus on many accounts contribute to the interest ofsociety. It would capacitate men of moderate abilities to practise the artof healing with real advantage to the public; it would enable every one ofliterary acquirements to distinguish the genuine disciples of medicine fromthose of boastful effrontery, or of wily address; and would teach mankindin some important situations the _knowledge of themselves_."|FALSE
15707|"There are some modern practitioners, who declaim against medical theory ingeneral, not considering that to think is to theorize; and that no one candirect a method of cure to a person labouring under disease withoutthinking, that is, without theorizing; and happy therefore is the patient,whose physician possesses the best theory."|FALSE

15707|"The whole of nature may be supposed to consist of two essences orsubstances; one of which may be termed spirit, and the other matter. Theformer of these possesses the power to commence or produce motion, and thelatter to receive and communicate it. So that motion, considered as acause, immediately precedes every effect; and, considered as an effect, itimmediately succeeds every cause."|FALSE
15707|"The MOTIONS OF MATTER may be divided into two kinds, primary and secondary.The secondary motions are those, which are given to or received from othermatter in motion. Their laws have been successfully investigated byphilosophers in their treatises on mechanic powers. These motions aredistinguished by this circumstance, that the velocity multiplied into thequantity of matter of the body acted upon is equal to the velocitymultiplied into the quantity of matter of the acting body."|FALSE
15707|"The primary motions of matter may be divided into three classes, thosebelonging to gravitation, to chemistry, and to life; and each class has itspeculiar laws. Though these three classes include the motions of solid,liquid, and aerial bodies; there is nevertheless a fourth division ofmotions; I mean those of the supposed ethereal fluids of magnetism,electricity, heat, and light; whose properties are not so well investigatedas to be classed with sufficient accuracy."|FALSE
15707|"_1st._ The gravitating motions include the annual and diurnal rotation ofthe earth and planets, the flux and reflux of the ocean, the descent ofheavy bodies, and other phænomena of gravitation. The unparalleled sagacityof the great NEWTON has deduced the laws of this class of motions from thesimple principle of the general attraction of matter. These motions aredistinguished by their tendency to or from the centers of the sun orplanets."|FALSE
15707|"_2d._ The chemical class of motions includes all the various appearances ofchemistry. Many of the facts, which belong to these branches of science,are nicely ascertained, and elegantly classed; but their laws have not yetbeen developed from such simple principles as those above-mentioned; thoughit is probable, that they depend on the specific attractions belonging tothe particles of bodies, or to the difference of the quantity of attractionbelonging to the sides and angles of those particles. The chemical motionsare distinguished by their being generally attended with an evidentdecomposition or new combination of the active materials."|FALSE

15707|"I.--1. The nervous system has its origin from the brain, and is distributedto every part of the body. Those nerves, which serve the senses,principally arise from that part of the brain, which is lodged in the head;and those, which serve the purposes of muscular motion, principally arisefrom that part of the brain, which is lodged in the neck and back, andwhich is erroneously called the spinal marrow. The ultimate fibrils ofthese nerves terminate in the immediate organs of sense and muscularfibres, and if a ligature be put on any part of their passage from the heador spine, all motion and perception cease in the parts beneath theligature."|FALSE
15707|"2. The longitudinal muscular fibres compose the locomotive muscles, whosecontractions move the bones of the limbs and trunk, to which theirextremities are attached. The annular or spiral muscular fibres compose thevascular muscles, which constitute the intestinal canal, the arteries,veins, glands, and absorbent vessels."|FALSE
15707|"3. The immediate organs of sense, as the retina of the eye, probablyconsist of moving fibrils, with a power of contraction similar to that ofthe larger muscles above described."|FALSE
15707|"4. The cellular membrane consists of cells, which resemble those of asponge, communicating with each other, and connecting together all theother parts of the body."|FALSE
15707|"5. The arterial system consists of the aortal and the pulmonary artery,which are attended through their whole course with their correspondentveins. The pulmonary artery receives the blood from the right chamber ofthe heart, and carries it to the minute extensive ramifications of thelungs, where it is exposed to the action of the air on a surface equal tothat of the whole external skin, through the thin moist coats of thosevessels, which are spread on the air-cells, which constitute the minuteterminal ramifications of the wind-pipe. Here the blood changes its colourfrom a dark red to a bright scarlet. It is then collected by the branchesof the pulmonary vein, and conveyed to the left chamber of the heart."|FALSE
15707|"6. The aorta is another large artery, which receives the blood from theleft chamber of the heart, after it has been thus aerated in the lungs, andconveys it by ascending and descending branches to every other part of thesystem; the extremities of this artery terminate either in glands, as thesalivary glands, lacrymal glands, &c. or in capillary vessels, which areprobably less involuted glands; in these some fluid, as saliva, tears,perspiration, are separated from the blood; and the remainder of the bloodis absorbed or drank up by branches of veins correspondent to the branchesof the artery; which are furnished with valves to prevent its return; andis thus carried back, after having again changed its colour to a dark red,to the right chamber of the heart. The circulation of the blood in theliver differs from this general system; for the veins which drink up therefluent blood from those arteries, which are spread on the bowels andmesentery, unite into a trunk in the liver, and form a kind of artery,which is branched into the whole substance of the liver, and is called thevena portarum; and from which the bile is separated by the numerous hepaticglands, which constitute that viscus."|FALSE
15707|"7. The glands may be divided into three systems, the convoluted glands,such as those above described, which separate bile, tears, saliva, &c.Secondly, the glands without convolution, as the capillary vessels, whichunite the terminations of the arteries and veins; and separate both themucus, which lubricates the cellular membrane, and the perspirable matter,which preserves the skin moist and flexible. And thirdly, the wholeabsorbent system, consisting of the lacteals, which open their mouths intothe stomach and intestines, and of the lymphatics, which open their mouthson the external surface of the body, and on the internal linings of all thecells of the cellular membrane, and other cavities of the body."|FALSE
15707|"These lacteal and lymphatic vessels are furnished with numerous valves toprevent the return of the fluids, which they absorb, and terminate inglands, called lymphatic glands, and may hence be considered as long necksor mouths belonging to these glands. To these they convey the chyle andmucus, with a part of the perspirable matter, and atmospheric moisture; allwhich, after having passed through these glands, and having suffered somechange in them, are carried forward into the blood, and supply perpetualnourishment to the system, or replace its hourly waste."|FALSE
15707|"8. The stomach and intestinal canal have a constant vermicular motion,which carries forwards their contents, after the lacteals have drank up thechyle from them; and which is excited into action by the stimulus of thealiment we swallow, but which becomes occasionally inverted or retrograde,as in vomiting, and in the iliac passion."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The word _sensorium_ in the following pages is designed to expressnot only the medullary part of the brain, spinal marrow, nerves, organs ofsense, and of the muscles; but also at the same time that living principle,or spirit of animation, which resides throughout the body, without beingcognizable to our senses, except by its effects. The changes whichoccasionally take place in the sensorium, as during the exertions ofvolition, or the sensations of pleasure or pain, are termed _sensorialmotions_."|FALSE
15707|"2. The similarity of the texture of the brain to that of the pancreas, andsome other glands of the body, has induced the inquirers into this subjectto believe, that a fluid, perhaps much more subtile than the electric aura,is separated from the blood by that organ for the purposes of motion andsensation. When we recollect, that the electric fluid itself is actuallyaccumulated and given out voluntarily by the torpedo and the gymnotuselectricus, that an electric shock will frequently stimulate into motion aparalytic limb, and lastly that it needs no perceptible tubes to convey it,this opinion seems not without probability; and the singular figure of thebrain and nervous system seems well adapted to distribute it over everypart of the body."|FALSE
15707|"For the medullary substance of the brain not only occupies the cavities ofthe head and spine, but passes along the innumerable ramifications of thenerves to the various muscles and organs of sense. In these it lays asideits coverings, and is intermixed with the slender fibres, which constitutethose muscles and organs of sense. Thus all these distant ramifications ofthe sensorium are united at one of their extremities, that is, in the headand spine; and thus these central parts of the sensorium constitute acommunication between all the organs of sense and muscles."|FALSE
15707|"3. A _nerve_ is a continuation of the medullary substance of the brain fromthe head or spine towards the other parts of the body, wrapped in itsproper membrane."|FALSE
15707|"4. The _muscular fibres_ are moving organs intermixed with that medullarysubstance, which is continued along the nerves, as mentioned above. Theyare indued with the power of contraction, and are again elongated either byantagonist muscles, by circulating fluids, or by elastic ligaments. So themuscles on one side of the forearm bend the fingers by means of theirtendons, and those on the other side of the fore-arm extend them again. Thearteries are distended by the circulating blood; and in the necks ofquadrupeds there is a strong elastic ligament, which assists the muscles,which elevate the head, to keep it in its horizontal position, and to raiseit after it has been depressed."|FALSE
15707|"5. The _immediate organs of sense_ consist in like manner of moving fibresenveloped in the medullary substance above mentioned; and are erroneouslysupposed to be simply an expansion of the nervous medulla, as the retina ofthe eye, and the rete mucosum of the skin, which are the immediate organsof vision, and of touch. Hence when we speak of the contractions of thefibrous parts of the body, we shall mean both the contractions of themuscles, and those of the immediate organs of sense. These _fibrousmotions_ are thus distinguished from the _sensorial motions_ abovementioned."|FALSE
15707|"6. The _external organs_ of sense are the coverings of the immediate organsof sense, and are mechanically adapted for the reception or transmission ofpeculiar bodies, or of their qualities, as the cornea and humours of theeye, the tympanum of the ear, the cuticle of the finders and tongue."|FALSE
15707|"7. The word _idea_ has various meanings in the writers of metaphysic: it ishere used simply for those notions of external things, which our organs ofsense bring us acquainted with originally; and is defined a contraction, ormotion, or configuration, of the fibres, which constitute the immediateorgan of sense; which will be explained at large in another part of thework. Synonymous with the word idea, we shall sometimes use the words_sensual motion_ in contradistinction to _muscular motion_."|FALSE
15707|"8. The word _perception_ includes both the action of the organ of sense inconsequence of the impact of external objects, and our attention to thataction; that is, it expresses both the motion of the organ of sense, oridea, and the pain or pleasure that succeeds or accompanies it."|FALSE
15707|"9. The pleasure or pain which necessarily accompanies all those perceptionsor ideas which we attend to, either gradually subsides, or is succeeded byother fibrous motions. In the latter case it is termed _sensation_, asexplained in Sect. V. 2, and VI. 2.--The reader is intreated to keep thisin his mind, that through all this treatise the word sensation is used toexpress pleasure or pain only in its active state, by whatever means it isintroduced into the system, without any reference to the stimulation ofexternal objects."|FALSE
15707|"10. The vulgar use of the word _memory_ is too unlimited for our purpose:those ideas which we voluntarily recall are here termed ideas of_recollection_, as when we will to repeat the alphabet backwards. And thoseideas which are suggested to us by preceding ideas are here termed ideas of_suggestion_, as whilst we repeat the alphabet in the usual order; when byhabits previously acquired B is suggested by A, and C by B, without anyeffort of deliberation."|FALSE
15707|"11. The word _association_ properly signifies a society or convention ofthings in some respects similar to each other. We never say in commonlanguage, that the effect is associated with the cause, though theynecessarily accompany or succeed each other. Thus the contractions of ourmuscles and organs of sense may be said to be associated together, butcannot with propriety be said to be associated with irritations, or withvolition, or with sensation; because they are caused by them, as mentionedin Sect. IV. When fibrous contractions succeed other fibrous contractions,the connection is termed _association_; when fibrous contractions succeedsensorial motions, the connection is termed _causation_; when fibrous andsensorial motions reciprocally introduce each other in progressive trainsor tribes, it is termed _catenation_ of animal motions. All theseconnections are said to be produced by _habit_; that is, by frequentrepetition."|FALSE
15707|"12. It may be proper to observe, that by the unavoidable idiom of ourlanguage the ideas of perception, of recollection, or of imagination, inthe plural number signify the ideas belonging to perception, torecollection, or to imagination; whilst the idea of perception, ofrecollection, or of imagination, in the singular number is used for what istermed \"a reflex idea of any of those operations of the sensorium.\""|FALSE
15707|"13.

Mr. Lock seems to have fallen into a further error, by conceiving,that the mind could form a general or abstract idea by its own operation,which was the copy of no particular perception; as of a triangle ingeneral, that was neither acute, obtuse, nor right angled. The ingeniousDr. Berkley and Mr. Hume have demonstrated, that such general ideas have noexistence in nature, not even in the mind of their celebrated inventor. Weshall therefore take for granted at present, that our recollection orimagination of external objects consists of a partial repetition of theperceptions, which were excited by those external objects, at the time webecame acquainted with them; and that our reflex ideas of the operations ofour minds are partial repetitions of those operations."|FALSE

The retina of an ox's eye wassuspended in a glass of warm water, and forcibly torn in a few places; theedges of these parts appeared jagged and hairy, and did not contract andbecome smooth like simple mucus, when it is distended till it breaks; whichevinced that it consisted of fibres.

The focus of a very large convex mirror was thrown byDr. Powel, in his lectures on experimental philosophy, in my presence, onone wing of this delicate balance, and it receded from the light; thrown onthe other wing, it approached towards the light, and this repeatedly; sothat no sensible impulse could be observed, but what might well be ascribedto the ascent of heated air."|FALSE

During the time of sleep, or in delirium, the ideas of imagination aremistaken for the perceptions of external objects; whence it appears, thatthese ideas of imagination, are no other than a reiteration of thosemotions of the organs of sense, which were originally excited by thestimulus of external objects: and in our waking hours the simple ideas,that we call up by recollection or by imagination, as the colour of red, orthe smell of a rose, are exact resemblances of the same simple ideas fromperception; and in consequence must be a repetition of those very motions."|FALSE

The disagreeable sensation called the tooth-edge is originally excitedby the painful jarring of the teeth in biting the edge of the glass, orporcelain cup, in which our food was given us in our infancy, as is furtherexplained in the Section XVI. 10, on Instinct.--This disagreeable sensationis afterwards excitable not only by a repetition of the sound, that wasthen produced, but by imagination alone, as I have myself frequentlyexperienced; in this case the idea of biting a china cup, when I imagine itvery distinctly, or when I see another person bite a cup or glass, excitesan actual pain in the nerves of my teeth.

Of this a satisfactory instance has fallen under myobservation. A gentleman about sixty years of age had been totally deaf fornear thirty years: he appeared to be a man of good understanding, andamused himself with reading, and by conversing either by the use of thepen, or by signs made with his fingers, to represent letters. I observedthat he had so far forgot the pronunciation of the language, that when heattempted to speak, none of his words had distinct articulation, though hisrelations could sometimes understand his meaning. But, which is much to thepoint, he assured me, that in his dreams he always imagined that peopleconversed with him by signs or writing, and never that he heard any onespeak to him. From hence it appears, that with the perceptions of sounds hehas also lost the ideas of them; though the organs of speech still retainsomewhat of their usual habits of articulation."|FALSE

They both told me that they did notremember to have ever dreamt of visible objects, since the total loss oftheir sight."|FALSE
15707|"V. Another method of discovering that our ideas are animal motions of theorgans of sense, is from considering the great analogy they bear to themotions of the larger muscles of the body. In the following articles itwill appear that they are originally excited into action by the irritationof external objects like our muscles; are associated together like ourmuscular motions; act in similar time with them; are fatigued by continuedexertion like them; and that the organs of sense are subject toinflammation, numbness, palsy, convulsion, and the defects of old age, inthe same manner as the muscular fibres."|FALSE
15707|"1. All our perceptions or ideas of external objects are universally allowedto have been originally excited by the stimulus of those external objects;and it will be shewn in a succeeding section, that it is probable that allour muscular motions, as well those that are become voluntary as those ofthe heart and glandular system, were originally in like manner excited bythe stimulus of something external to the organ of motion."|FALSE
15707|"2. Our ideas are also associated together after their production preciselyin the same manner as our muscular motions; which will likewise be fullyexplained in the succeeding section."|FALSE
15707|"3. The time taken up in performing an idea is likewise much the same asthat taken up in performing a muscular motion. A musician can press thekeys of an harpsichord with his fingers in the order of a tune he has beenaccustomed to play, in as little time as he can run over those notes in hismind. So we many times in an hour cover our eye-balls with our eye-lidswithout perceiving that we are in the dark; hence the perception or idea oflight is not changed for that of darkness in so small a time as thetwinkling of an eye; so that in this case the muscular motion of theeye-lid is performed quicker than the perception of light can be changedfor that of darkness.--So if a fire-stick be whirled round in the dark, aluminous circle appears to the observer; if it be whirled somewhat slower,this circle becomes interrupted in one part; and then the time taken up insuch a revolution of the stick is the same that the observer uses inchanging his ideas: thus the [Greek: dolikoskoton enkos] of Homer, the longshadow of the flying javelin, is elegantly designed to give us an idea ofits velocity, and not of its length."|FALSE
15707|"4. The fatigue that follows a continued attention of the mind to one objectis relieved by changing the subject of our thoughts; as the continuedmovement of one limb is relieved by moving another in its stead.

15707|"5. If the muscles of any limb are inflamed, they do not move without pain;so when the retina is inflamed, its motions also are painful. Hence lightis as intolerable in this kind of ophthalmia, as pressure is to the fingerin the paronychia. In this disease the patients frequently dream of havingtheir eyes painfully dazzled; hence the idea of strong light is painful aswell as the reality. The first of these facts evinces that our perceptionsare motions of the organs of sense; and the latter, that our imaginationsare also motions of the same organs."|FALSE
15707|"6. The organs of sense, like the moving muscles, are liable to becomebenumbed, or less sensible, from compression.

After having carefully considered this disease, Ithought the convulsions of her ideas less dangerous than those of hermuscles; and having in vain attempted to make any opiate continue in herstomach, an ounce of laudanum was rubbed along the spine of her back, and adram of it was used as an enema; by this medicine a kind of drunkendelirium was continued many hours; and when it ceased the convulsions didnot return; and the lady continued well many years, except some lighterrelapses, which were relieved in the same manner."|FALSE

These periods of convulsions, first ofthe muscles, and then of the ideas, returned twice a day for several weeks;and were at length removed by great doses of opium, after a great varietyof other medicines and applications had been in vain experienced.

This is sensibly observedby those who apply themselves late in life to music, fencing, or any of themechanic arts. In the same manner many elderly people retain the ideas theyhad learned early in life, but find great difficulty in acquiring newtrains of memory; insomuch that in extreme old age we frequently see aforgetfulness of the business of yesterday, and at the same time acircumstantial remembrance of the amusements of their youth; till at lengththe ideas of recollection and activity of the body gradually ceasetogether,--such is the condition of humanity!--and nothing remains but thevital motions and sensations."|FALSE

After the amputation, of a foot or a finger, it has frequentlyhappened, that an injury being offered to the stump of the amputated limb,whether from cold air, too great pressure, or other accidents, the patienthas complained, of a sensation of pain in the foot or finger, that was cutoff. Does not this evince that all our ideas are excited in the brain, andnot in the organs of sense?

15707|"I. 1. Many of our muscular motions are excited by perpetual irritations, asthose of the heart and arterial system by the circumfluent blood. Manyother of them are excited by intermitted irritations, as those of thestomach and bowels by the aliment we swallow; of the bile-ducts by thebile; of the kidneys, pancreas, and many other glands, by the peculiarfluids they separate from the blood; and those of the lacteal and otherabsorbent vessels by the chyle, lymph, and moisture of the atmosphere.These motions are accelerated or retarded, as their correspondentirritations are increased or diminished, without our attention orconsciousness, in the same manner as the various secretions of fruit, gum,resin, wax, and, honey, are produced in the vegetable world, and as thejuices of the earth and the moisture of the atmosphere are absorbed bytheir roots and foliage."|FALSE
15707|"2. Other muscular motions, that are most frequently connected with oursensations, as those of the sphincters of the bladder and anus, and themusculi erectores penis, were originally excited into motion by irritation,for young children make water, and have other evacuations without attentionto these circumstances; \"et primis etiam ab incunabulis tenduntur sæpiuspuerorum penes, amore nondum expergefacto.\" So the nipples of young womenare liable to become turgid by irritation, long before they are in asituation to be excited by the pleasure of giving milk to the lips of achild."|FALSE
15707|"3. The contractions of the larger muscles of our bodies, that are mostfrequently connected with volition, were originally excited into action byinternal irritations: as appears from the stretching or yawning of allanimals after long sleep. In the beginning of some fevers this irritationof the muscles produces perpetual stretching and yawning; in other periodsof fever an universal restlessness arises from the same cause, the patientchanging the attitude of his body every minute. The repeated struggles ofthe foetus in the uterus must be owing to this internal irritation: for thefoetus can have no other inducement to move its limbs but the tædium orirksomeness of a continued posture."|FALSE
15707|"The following case evinces, that the motions of stretching the limbs aftera continued attitude are not always owing to the power of the will. Mr.Dean, a mason, of Austry in Leicestershire, had the spine of the thirdvertebra of the back enlarged; in some weeks his lower extremities becamefeeble, and at length quite paralytic: neither the pain of blisters, theheat of fomentations, nor the utmost efforts of the will could produce theleast motion in these limbs; yet twice or thrice a day for many months hisfeet, legs, and thighs, were affected for many minutes with forceablestretchings, attended with the sensation of fatigue; and he at lengthrecovered the use of his limbs, though the spine continued protuberant. Thesame circumstance is frequently seen in a less degree in the commonhemiplagia; and when this happens, I have believed repeated and strongshocks of electricity to have been of great advantage."|FALSE
15707|"4. In like manner the various organs of sense are originally excited intomotion by various external stimuli adapted to this purpose, which motionsare termed perceptions or ideas; and many of these motions during ourwaking hours are excited by perpetual irritation, as those of the organs ofhearing and of touch. The former by the constant low indistinct noises thatmurmur around us, and the latter by the weight of our bodies on the partswhich support them; and by the unceasing variations of the heat, moisture,and pressure of the atmosphere; and these sensual motions, precisely as themuscular ones above mentioned, obey their correspondent irritations withoutour attention or consciousness."|FALSE
15707|"5. Other classes of our ideas are more frequently excited by our sensationsof pleasure or pain, and others by volition: but that these have all beenoriginally excited by stimuli from external objects, and only vary in theircombinations or reparations, has been fully evinced by Mr. Locke: and areby him termed the ideas of perception in contradistinction to those, whichhe calls the ideas of reflection."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. These muscular motions, that are excited by perpetual irritation,are nevertheless occasionally excitable by the sensations of pleasure orpain, or by volition; as appears by the palpitation of the heart from fear,the increased secretion of saliva at the sight of agreeable food, and theglow on the skin of those who are ashamed. There is an instance told in thePhilosophical Transactions of a man, who could for a time stop the motionof his heart when he pleased; and Mr. D. has often told me, be could so farincrease the peristaltic motion of his bowels by voluntary efforts, as toproduce an evacuation by stool at any time in half an hour."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are excited byperpetual irritation, are nevertheless occasionally excited by sensation orvolition; as in the night, when we listen under the influence of fear, orfrom voluntary attention, the motions excited in the organ of hearing bythe whispering of the air in our room, the pulsation of our own arteries,or the faint beating of a distant watch, become objects of perception."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of other motions are associated withthese muscular motions which are excited by irritation; as by the stimulusof the blood in the right chamber of the heart, the lungs are induced toexpand themselves; and the pectoral and intercostal muscles, and thediaphragm, act at the same time by their associations with them. And whenthe pharinx is irritated by agreeable food, the muscles of deglutition arebrought into action by association. Thus when a greater light falls on theeye, the iris is brought into action without our attention; and the ciliaryprocess, when the focus is formed before or behind the retina, by theirassociations with the increased irritative motions of the organ of vision.Many common actions of life are produced in a similar manner. If a flysettle on my forehead, whilst I am intent on my present occupation, Idislodge it with my finger, without exciting my attention or breaking thetrain of my ideas."|FALSE
15707|"2. In like manner the irritative ideas suggest to us many other trains ortribes of ideas that are associated with them. On this kind of connection,language, letters, hieroglyphics, and every kind of symbol, depend. Thesymbols themselves produce irritative ideas, or sensual motions, which wedo not attend to; and other ideas, that are succeeded by sensation, areexcited by their association with them. And as these irritative ideas makeup a part of the chain of our waking thoughts, introducing other ideas thatengage our attention, though themselves are unattended to, we find it verydifficult to investigate by what steps many of our hourly trains of ideasgain their admittance."|FALSE
15707|"It may appear paradoxical, that ideas can exist, and not be attended to;but all our perceptions are ideas excited by irritation, and succeeded bysensation. Now when these ideas excited by irritation give us neitherpleasure nor pain, we cease to attend to them. Thus whilst I am walkingthrough that grove before my window, I do not run against the trees or thebenches, though my thoughts are strenuously exerted on some other object.This leads us to a distinct knowledge of irritative ideas, for the idea ofthe tree or bench, which I avoid, exists on my retina, and induces byassociation the action of certain locomotive muscles; though neither itselfnor the actions of those muscles engage my attention."|FALSE
15707|"Thus whilst we are conversing on this subject, the tone, note, andarticulation of every individual word forms its correspondent irritativeidea on the organ of hearing; but we only attend to the associated ideas,that are attached by habit to these irritative ones, and are succeeded bysensation; thus when we read the words \"PRINTING-PRESS\" we do not attend tothe shape, size, or existence of the letters which compose these words,though each of them excites a correspondent irritative motion of our organof vision, but they introduce by association our idea of the most useful ofmodern inventions; the capacious reservoir of human knowledge, whosebranching streams diffuse sciences, arts, and morality, through all nationsand all ages."|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. Many of the motions of our muscles, that are excited into action byirritation, are at the same time accompanied with painful or pleasurablesensations; and at length become by habit causable by the sensations. Thusthe motions of the sphincters of the bladder and anus were originallyexcited into action by irritation; for young children give no attention tothese evacuations; but as soon as they become sensible of the inconvenienceof obeying these irritations, they suffer the water or excrement toaccumulate, till it disagreeably affects them; and the action of thosesphincters is then in consequence of this disagreeable sensation. So thesecretion of saliva, which in young children is copiously produced byirritation, and drops from their mouths, is frequently attended with theagreeable sensation produced by the mastication of tasteful food;, till atlength the sight of such food to a hungry person excites into action thesesalival glands; as is seen in the slavering of hungry dogs."|FALSE

Many of the motions of our organs of sense, or ideas, that wereoriginally excited into action by irritation, become in like manner morefrequently causable by our sensations of pleasure or pain. These motionsare then termed the ideas of imagination, and make up all the scenery andtransactions of our dreams. Thus when any painful or pleasurable sensationspossess us, as of love, anger, fear; whether in our sleep or waking hours,the ideas, that have been formerly excited by the objects of thesesensations, now vividly recur before us by their connection with thesesensations themselves. So the fair smiling virgin, that excited your loveby her presence, whenever that sensation recurs, rises before you inimagination; and that with all the pleasing circumstances, that had beforeengaged your attention. And in sleep, when you dream under the influence offear, all the robbers, fires, and precipices, that you formerly have seenor heard of, arise before you with terrible vivacity.

At length they become voluntarily practised insuccession or in combination for the common purposes of life; as when wemake ourselves masters of the history of mankind, or of the sciences theyhave investigated; and are then called ideas of recollection; and areperformed with strength and velocity in proportion to the energy of thevolition that excites them, and the quantity of sensorial power."|FALSE

Many of our muscular motions were originally excited in successivetrains, as the contractions of the auricles and of the ventricles of theheart; and others in combined tribes, as the various divisions of themuscles which compose the calf of the leg, which were originally irritatedinto synchronous action by the tædium or irksomeness of a continuedposture. By frequent repetitions these motions acquire associations, whichcontinue during our lives, and even after the destruction of the greatestpart of the sensorium; for the heart of a viper or frog will continue topulsate long after it is taken from the body; and when it has entirelyceased to move, if any part of it is goaded with a pin, the whole heartwill again renew its pulsations. This kind of connection we shall termirritative association, to distinguish it from sensitive and voluntaryassociations."|FALSE

In like manner many of our ideas are originally excited in tribes; asall the objects of sight, after we become so well acquainted with the lawsof vision, as to distinguish figure and distance as well as colour; or intrains, as while we pass along the objects that surround us. The tribesthus received by irritation become associated by habit, and have beentermed complex ideas by the writers of metaphysics, as this book, or thatorange.

By the various efforts of our sensations to acquire or avoid theirobjects, many muscles are daily brought into successive or synchronousactions; these become associated by habit, and are then excited togetherwith great facility, and in many instances gain indissoluble connections.So the play of puppies and kittens is a representation of their mode offighting or of taking their prey; and the motions of the muscles necessaryfor those purposes become associated by habit, and gain a great adroitnessof action by these early repetitions: so the motions of the abdominalmuscles, which were originally brought into concurrent action, with theprotrusive motion of the rectum or bladder by sensation, become soconjoined with them by habit, that they not only easily obey thesesensations occasioned by the stimulus of the excrement and urine, but arebrought into violent and unrestrainable action in the strangury andtenesmus. This kind of connection we shall term sensitive association."|FALSE

And hence those unconquerable antipathies areformed, which some people have to the sight of peculiar kinds of food, ofwhich in their infancy they have eaten to excess or by constraint."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. In learning any mechanic art, as music, dancing, or the use of thesword, we teach many of our muscles to act together or in succession byrepeated voluntary efforts; which by habit become formed into tribes ortrains of association, and serve all our purposes with great facility, andin some instances acquire an indissoluble union. These motions aregradually formed into a habit of acting together by a multitude ofrepetitions, whilst they are yet separately causable by the will, as isevident from the long time that is taken up by children in learning to walkand to speak; and is experienced by every one, when he first attempts toskate upon the ice or to swim: these we shall term voluntary associations."|FALSE
15707|"2. All these muscular movements, when they are thus associated into tribesor trains, become afterwards not only obedient to volition, but to thesensations and irritations; and the same movement composes a part of manydifferent tribes or trains of motion. Thus a single muscle, when it acts inconsort with its neighbours on one side, assists to move the limb in onedirection; and in another, when, it acts with those in its neighbourhood onthe other side; and in other directions, when it acts separately or jointlywith those that lie immediately under or above it; and all these with equalfacility after their associations have been well established."|FALSE

15707|"I. The various organs of sense require various kinds of stimulation toexcite them into action; the particles of light penetrate the cornea andhumours of the eye, and then irritate the naked retina; rapid particles,dissolved or diffused in water or saliva, and odorous ones, mixed orcombined with the air, irritate the extremities of the nerves of taste andsmell; which either penetrate, or are expanded on the membranes of thetongue and nostrils; the auditory nerves are stimulated by the vibrationsof the atmosphere communicated by means of the tympanum and of the fluid,whether of air or of water, behind it; and the nerves of touch by thehardness of surrounding bodies, though the cuticle is interposed betweenthese bodies and the medulla of the nerve."|FALSE
15707|"As the nerves of the senses have each their appropriated objects, whichstimulate them into activity; so the muscular fibres, which are theterminations of other sets of nerves, have their peculiar objects, whichexcite them into action; the longitudinal muscles are stimulated intocontraction by extension, whence the stretching or pandiculation after along continued posture, during which they have been kept in a state ofextension; and the hollow muscles are excited into action by distention, asthose of the rectum and bladder are induced to protrude their contents fromtheir sense of the distention rather than of the acrimony of thosecontents."|FALSE
15707|"There are other objects adapted to stimulate the nerves, which terminate invariety of membranes, and those especially which form the terminations ofcanals; thus the preparations of mercury particularly affect the salivaryglands, ipecacuanha the stomach, aloe the sphincter of the anus,cantharides that of the bladder, and lastly every gland of the body appearsto be indued with a kind of taste, by which it selects or forms each itspeculiar fluid from the blood; and by which it is irritated into activity."|FALSE
15707|"Many of these external properties of bodies, which stimulate our organs ofsense, do not seem to effect this by a single impulse, but by repeatedimpulses; as the nerve of the ear is probably not excitable by a singlevibration of air, nor the optic nerve by a single particle of light; whichcircumstance produces some analogy between those two senses, at the sametime the solidity of bodies is perceived by a single application of a solidbody to the nerves of touch, and that even through the cuticle; and we areprobably possessed of a peculiar sense to distinguish the nice degrees ofheat and cold."|FALSE

15707|"II. Many motions are produced by pleasure or pain, and that even incontradiction to the power of volition, as in laughing, or in thestrangury; but as no name has been given to pleasure or pain, at the timeit is exerted so as to cause fibrous motions, we have used the termsensation for this purpose; and mean it to bear the same analogy topleasure and pain, that the word volition does to desire and aversion."|FALSE
15707|"1. It was mentioned in the fifth Section, that, what we have termedsensation is a motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium,_beginning_ at some of the extremities of it. This appears first, becauseour pains and pleasures are always caused by our ideas or muscular motions,which are the motions of the extremities of the sensorium. And, secondly,because the sensation of pleasure or pain frequently continues some timeafter the ideas or muscular motions which excited it have ceased: for weoften feel a glow of pleasure from an agreeable reverie, for many minutesafter the ideas, that were the subject of it, have escaped our memory; andfrequently experience a dejection of spirits without being able to assignthe cause of it but by much recollection."|FALSE
15707|"When the sensorial faculty of desire or aversion is exerted so as to causefibrous motions, it is termed volition; which is said in Sect. V. to be amotion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, _terminating_ insome of the extremities of it. This appears, first, because our desires andaversions always terminate in recollecting and comparing our ideas, or inexerting our muscles; which are the motions of the extremities of thesensorium. And, secondly, because desire or aversion begins, and frequentlycontinues for a time in the central parts of the sensorium, before it ispeculiarly exerted at the extremities of it; for we sometimes feel desireor aversion without immediately knowing their objects, and in consequencewithout immediately exerting any of our muscular or sensual motions toattain them: as in the beginning of the passion of love, and perhaps ofhunger, or in the ennui of indolent people."|FALSE
15707|"Though sensation and volition begin or terminate at the extremities orcentral parts of the sensorium, yet the whole of it is frequentlyinfluenced by the exertion of these faculties, as appears from theireffects on the external habit: for the whole skin is reddened by shame, andan universal trembling is produced by fear: and every muscle of the body isagitated in angry people by the desire of revenge."|FALSE
15707|"There is another very curious circumstance, which shews that sensation andvolition are movements of the sensorium in contrary directions; that is,that volition begins at the central parts of it, and proceeds to theextremities; and that sensation begins at the extremities, and proceeds tothe central parts: I mean that these two sensorial faculties cannot bestrongly exerted at the same time; for when we exert our volition strongly,we do not attend to pleasure or pain; and conversely, when we are stronglyaffected with the sensation of pleasure or pain, we use no volition. Aswill be further explained in Section XVIII. on sleep, and Section XXXIV. onvolition."|FALSE
15707|"2. All our emotions and passions seem to arise out of the exertions ofthese two faculties of the animal sensorium. Pride, hope, joy, are thenames of particular pleasures: shame, despair, sorrow, are the names ofpeculiar pains: and love, ambition, avarice, of particular desires: hatred,disgust, fear, anxiety, of particular aversions. Whilst the passion ofanger includes the pain from a recent injury, and the aversion to theadversary that occasioned it. And compassion is the pain we experience atthe sight of misery, and the desire of relieving it."|FALSE
15707|"There is another tribe of desires, which are commonly termed appetites, andare the immediate consequences of the absence of some irritative motions.Those, which arise from defect of internal irritations, have proper namesconferred upon them, as hunger, thirst, lust, and the desire of air, whenour respiration is impaired by noxious vapours; and of warmth, when we areexposed to too great a degree of cold. But those, whose stimuli areexternal to the body, are named from the objects, which are by natureconstituted to excite them; these desires originate from our pastexperience of the pleasurable sensations they occasion, as the smell of anhyacinth, or the taste of a pine-apple."|FALSE
15707|"Whence it appears, that our pleasures and pains are at least as various andas numerous as our irritations; and that our desires and aversions must beas numerous as our pleasures and pains. And that as sensation is here usedas a general term for our numerous pleasures and pains, when they producethe contractions of our fibres; so volition is the general name for ourdesires and aversions, when they produce fibrous contractions. Thus when amotion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, terminates in theexertion of our muscles, it is generally called voluntary action; when itterminates in the exertion of our ideas, it is termed recollection,reasoning, determining."|FALSE
15707|"3. As the sensations of pleasure and pain are originally introduced by theirritations of external objects: so our desires and aversions areoriginally introduced by those sensations; for when the objects of ourpleasures or pains are at a distance, and we cannot instantaneously possessthe one, or avoid the other, then desire or aversion is produced, and avoluntary exertion of our ideas or muscles succeeds."|FALSE
15707|"The pain of hunger excites you to look out for food, the tree, that shadesyou, presents its odoriferous fruit before your eyes, you approach, pluck,and eat."|FALSE
15707|"The various movements of walking to the tree, gathering the fruit, andmasticating it, are associated motions introduced by their connection withsensation; but if from the uncommon height of the tree, the fruit beinaccessible, and you are prevented from quickly possessing the intendedpleasure, desire is produced. The consequence of this desire is, first, adeliberation about the means to gain the object of pleasure in process oftime, as it cannot be procured immediately; and, secondly, the muscularaction necessary for this purpose."|FALSE
15707|"You voluntarily call up all your ideas of causation, that are related tothe effect you desire, and voluntarily examine and compare them, and atlength determine whether to ascend the tree, or to gather stones from theneighbouring brook, is easier to practise, or more promising of success;and, finally, you gather the stones, and repeatedly fling them to dislodgethe fruit."|FALSE
15707|"Hence then we gain a criterion to distinguish voluntary acts or thoughtsfrom those caused by sensation. As the former are always employed about the_means_ to acquire pleasurable objects, or the _means_ to avoid painfulones; while the latter are employed in the possession of those, which arealready in our power."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the activity of this power of volition produces the great differencebetween the human and the brute creation. The ideas and the actions ofbrutes are almost perpetually employed about their present pleasures, ortheir present pains; and, except in the few instances which are mentionedin Section XVI, on instinct, they seldom busy themselves about the means ofprocuring future bliss, or of avoiding future misery; so that the acquiringof languages, the making of tools, and labouring for money, which are allonly the means to procure pleasures; and the praying to the Deity, asanother means to procure happiness, are characteristic of human nature."|FALSE
15707|"4. As there are many diseases produced by the quantity of the sensation ofpain or pleasure being too great or too little; so are there diseasesproduced by the susceptibility of the constitution to motions causable bythese sensations being too dull or too vivid. This susceptibility of thesystem to sensitive motions is termed sensibility, to distinguish it fromsensation, which is the actual existence or exertion of pain or pleasure."|FALSE
15707|"Other classes of diseases are owing to the excessive promptitude, orsluggishness of the constitution to voluntary exertions, as well as to thequantity of desire or of aversion.

And as many separate motions of our muscles thus become united, andform, as it were, one motion; so each separate motion before such union maybe conceived to consist of many parts or spaces moved through; and perhapseven the individual fibres of our muscles have thus gradually been broughtto act in concert, which habits began to be acquired as early as the veryformation of the moving organs, long before the nativity of the animal; asexplained in the Section XVI. 2. on instinct."|FALSE
15707|"2. There are many motions of the body, belonging to the irritative class,which might by a hasty observer be mistaken for associated ones; as theperistaltic motion of the stomach and intestines, and the contractions ofthe heart and arteries, might be supposed to be associated with theirritative motions of their nerves of sense, rather than to be excited bythe irritation of their muscular fibres by the distention, acrimony, ormomentum of the blood. So the distention or elongation of muscles byobjects external to them irritates them into contraction, though thecuticle or other parts may intervene between the stimulating body and thecontracting muscle. Thus a horse voids his excrement when its weight orbulk irritates the rectum or sphincter ani. These muscles act from theirritation of distention, when he excludes his excrement, but the musclesof the abdomen and diaphragm are brought into motion by association withthose of the sphincter and rectum."|FALSE

If two particles of iron lie near each other without motion, andafterwards approach each other; it is reasonable to conclude that somethingbesides the iron particles is the cause of their approximation; thisinvisible something is termed magnetism. In the same manner, if theparticles, which compose an animal muscle, do not touch each other in therelaxed state of the muscle, and are brought into contact during thecontraction of the muscle, it is reasonable to conclude, that some otheragent is the cause of this new approximation. For nothing can act, where itdoes not exist; for to act includes to exist; and therefore the particlesof the muscular fibre (which in its state of relaxation are supposed not totouch) cannot affect each other without the influence of some intermediateagent; this agent is here termed the spirit of animation, or sensorialpower, but may with equal propriety be termed the power, which causescontraction; or may be called by any other name, which the reader maychoose to affix to it."|FALSE
15707|"The contraction of a muscular fibre may be compared to the followingelectric experiment, which is here mentioned not as a philosophicalanalogy, but as an illustration or simile to facilitate the conception of adifficult subject. Let twenty very small Leyden phials properly coated behung in a row by fine silk threads at a small distance from each other; letthe internal charge of one phial be positive, and of the other negativealternately, if a communication be made from the internal surface of thefirst to the external surface of the last in the row, they will all of theminstantly approach each other, and thus shorten a line that might connectthem like a muscular fibre. See Botanic Garden, p. 1. Canto I. 1. 202, noteon Gymnotus."|FALSE
15707|"The attractions of electricity or of magnetism do not apply philosophicallyto the illustration of the contraction of animal fibres, since the force ofthose attractions increases in some proportion inversely as the distance,but in muscular motion there appears no difference in velocity or strengthduring the beginning or end of the contraction, but what may be clearlyascribed to the varying mechanic advantage in the approximation of one boneto another. Nor can muscular motion be assimilated with greaterplausibility to the attraction of cohesion or elasticity; for in bending asteel spring, as a small sword, a less force is required to bend it thefirst inch than the second; and the second than the third; the particles ofsteel on the convex side of the bent spring endeavouring to restorethemselves more powerfully the further they are drawn from each other. SeeBotanic Garden, P. I. addit. Note XVIII."|FALSE
15707|"I am aware that this may be explained another way, by supposing theelasticity of the spring to depend more on the compression of the particleson the concave side than on the extension of them on the convex side; andby supposing the elasticity of the elastic gum to depend more on theresistance to the lateral compression of its particles than to thelongitudinal extension of them. Nevertheless in muscular contraction, asabove observed, there appears no difference in the velocity or force of itat its commencement or at its termination; from whence we must concludethat animal contraction is governed by laws of its own, and not by those ofmechanics, chemistry, magnetism, or electricity."|FALSE
15707|"On these accounts I do not think the experiments conclusive, which werelately published by Galvani, Volta, and others, to shew a similitudebetween the spirit of animation, which contracts the muscular fibres, andthe electric fluid. Since the electric fluid may act only as a more potentstimulus exciting the muscular fibres into action, and not by supplyingthem with a new quantity of the spirit of life. Thus in a recent hemiplegiaI have frequently observed, when the patient yawned and stretched himself,that the paralytic limbs moved also, though they were totally disobedientto the will. And when he was electrified by passing shocks from theaffected hand to the affected foot, a motion of the paralytic limbs wasalso produced. Now as in the act of yawning the muscles of the paralyticlimbs were excited into action by the stimulus of the irksomeness of acontinued posture, and not by any additional quantity of the spirit oflife; so we may conclude, that the passage of the electric fluid, whichproduced a similar effect, acted only as a stimulus, and not by supplyingany addition of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"If nevertheless this theory should ever become established, a stimulus mustbe called an eductor of vital ether; which stimulus may consist ofsensation or volition, as in the electric eel, as well as in the appulsesof external bodies; and by drawing off the charges of vital fluid mayoccasion the contraction or motions of the muscular fibres, and organs ofsense."|FALSE
15707|"2. The immediate effect of the action of the spirit of animation orsensorial power on the fibrous parts of the body, whether it acts in themode of irritation, sensation, volition, or association, is a contractionof the animal fibre, according to the second law of animal causation. Sect.IV. Thus the stimulus of the blood induces the contraction of the heart;the agreeable taste of a strawberry produces the contraction of the musclesof deglutition; the effort of the will contracts the muscles, which movethe limbs in walking; and by association other muscles of the trunk arebrought into contraction to preserve the balance of the body. The fibrousextremities of the organs of sense have been shewn, by the ocular spectrain Sect. III. to suffer similar contraction by each of the above modes ofexcitation; and by their configurations to constitute our ideas."|FALSE
15707|"3. After animal fibres have for some time been excited into contraction, arelaxation succeeds, even though the exciting cause continues to act. Inrespect to the irritative motions this is exemplified in the peristalticcontractions of the bowels; which cease and are renewed alternately, thoughthe stimulus of the aliment continues to be uniformly applied; in thesensitive motions, as in strangury, tenesmus, and parturition, thealternate contractions and relaxations of the muscles exist, though thestimulus is perpetual. In our voluntary exertions it is experienced, as noone can hang long by the hands, however vehemently he wills so to do; andin the associate motions the constant change of our attitudes evinces thenecessity of relaxation to those muscles, which have been long in action."|FALSE
15707|"This relaxation of a muscle after its contraction, even though the stimuluscontinues to be applied, appears to arise from the expenditure ordiminution of the spirit of animation previously resident in the muscle,according to the second law of animal causation in Sect. IV. In thoseconstitutions, which are termed weak, the spirit of animation becomessooner exhausted, and tremulous motions are produced, as in the hands ofinfirm people, when they lift a cup to their mouths. This quickerexhaustion of the spirit of animation is probably owing to a less quantityof it residing in the acting fibres, which therefore more frequentlyrequire a supply from the nerves, which belong to them."|FALSE
15707|"4. If the sensorial power continues to act, whether it acts in the mode ofirritation, sensation, volition, or association, a new contraction of theanimal fibre succeeds after a certain interval; which interval is ofshorter continuance in weak people than in strong ones. This is exemplifiedin the shaking of the hands of weak people, when they attempt to write. Ina manuscript epistle of one of my correspondents, which is written in asmall hand, I observed from four to six zigzags in the perpendicular strokeof every letter, which shews that both the contractions of the fingers, andintervals between them, must have been performed in very short periods oftime."|FALSE
15707|"The times of contraction of the muscles of enfeebled people being less, andthe intervals between those contractions being less also, accounts for thequick pulse in fevers with debility, and in dying animals. The shortness ofthe intervals between one contraction and another in weak constitutions, isprobably owing to the general deficiency of the quantity of the spirit ofanimation, and that therefore there is a less quantity of it to be receivedat each interval of the activity of the fibres. Hence in repeated motions,as of the fingers in performing on the harpsichord, it would at first sightappear, that swiftness and strength were incompatible; nevertheless thesingle contraction of a muscle is performed with greater velocity as wellas with greater force by vigorous constitutions, as in throwing a javelin."|FALSE
15707|"There is however another circumstance, which may often contribute to causethe quickness of the pulse in nervous fevers, as in animals bleeding todeath in the slaughter-house; which is the deficient quantity of blood;whence the heart is but half distended, and in consequence soonercontracts. See Sect. XXXII. 2. 1."|FALSE
15707|"For we must not confound frequency of repetition with quickness of motion,or the number of pulsations with the velocity, with which the fibres, whichconstitute the coats of the arteries, contract themselves. For where thefrequency of the pulsations is but seventy-five in a minute, as in health;the contracting fibres, which constitute the sides of the arteries, maymove through a greater space in a given time, than where the frequency ofpulsation is one hundred and fifty in a minute, as in some fevers withgreat debility. For if in those fevers the arteries do not expandthemselves in their diastole to more than half the usual diameter of theirdiastole in health, the fibres which constitute their coats, will movethrough a less space in a minute than in health, though they make twopulsations for one."|FALSE
15707|"Suppose the diameter of the artery during its systole to be one line, andthat the diameter of the same artery during its diastole is in health isfour lines, and in a fever with, great debility only two lines. It follows,that the arterial fibres contract in health from a circle of twelve linesin circumference to a circle of three lines in circumference, that is theymove through a space of nine lines in length. While the arterial fibres inthe fever with debility would twice contract from a circle of six lines toa circle of three lines; that is while they move through a space equal tosix lines. Hence though the frequency of pulsation in fever be greater astwo to one, yet the velocity of contraction in health is greater as nine tosix, or as three to two."|FALSE
15707|"On the contrary in inflammatory diseases with strength, as in the pleurisy,the velocity of the contracting sides of the arteries is much greater thanin health, for if we suppose the number of pulsations in a pleurisy to behalf as much more than in health, that is as one hundred and twenty toeighty, (which is about what generally happens in inflammatory diseases)and if the diameter of the artery in diastole be one third greater than inhealth, which I believe is near the truth, the result will be, that thevelocity of the contractile sides of the arteries will be in a pleurisy astwo and a half to one, compared to the velocity of their contraction in astate of health, for if the circumference of the systole of the artery bethree lines, and the diastole in health be twelve lines in circumference,and in a pleurisy eighteen lines; and secondly, if the artery pulsatesthrice in the diseased state for twice in the healthy one, it follows, thatthe velocity of contraction in the diseased state to that in the healthystate will be forty-five to eighteen, or as two and a half to one."|FALSE
15707|"From hence it would appear, that if we had a criterion to determine thevelocity of the arterial contractions, it would at the same time give ustheir strength, and thus be of more service in distinguishing diseases,than the knowledge of their frequency. As such a criterion cannot be had,the frequency of pulsation, the age of the patient being allowed for, willin some measure assist us to distinguish arterial strength from arterialdebility, since in inflammatory diseases with strength the frequency seldomexceeds one hundred and eighteen or one hundred and twenty pulsations in aminute; unless under peculiar circumstance, as the great additional stimuliof wine or of external heat."|FALSE
15707|"5. After a muscle or organ of sense has been excited into contraction, andthe sensorial power ceases to act, the last situation or configuration ofit continues; unless it be disturbed by the action of some antagonistfibres, or other extraneous power. Thus in weak or languid people, whereverthey throw their limbs on their bed or sofa, there they lie, till anotherexertion changes their attitude; hence one kind of ocular spectra seems tobe produced after looking at bright objects; thus when a fire-stick iswhirled round in the night, there appears in the eye a complete circle offire; the action or configuration of one part of the retina not ceasingbefore the return of the whirling fire."|FALSE

This occurs in a less degree in thelocomotive muscles, and is called wearysomeness. In the two former kinds ofsensation there is an expenditure of sensorial power, in these latter thereis an accumulation of it."|FALSE
15707|"7. We have used the words exertion of sensorial power as a general term toexpress either irritation, sensation, volition, or association; that is, toexpress the activity or motion of the spirit of animation, at the time itproduces the contractions of the fibrous parts of the system. It may besupposed that there may exist a greater or less mobility of the fibrousparts of our system, or a propensity to be stimulated into contraction bythe greater or less quantity or energy of the spirit of animation; and thathence if the exertion of the sensorial power be in its natural state, andthe mobility of the fibres be increased, the same quantity of fibrouscontraction will be caused, as if the mobility of the fibres continues inits natural state, and the sensorial exertion be increased."|FALSE
15707|"Thus it may be conceived, that in diseases accompanied with strength, as ininflammatory fevers with arterial strength, that the cause of greaterfibrous contraction, may exist in the increased mobility of the fibres,whose contractions are thence both more forceable and more frequent. Andthat in diseases attended with debility, as in nervous fevers, where thefibrous contractions are weaker, and more frequent, it may be conceivedthat the cause consists in a decrease of mobility of the fibres; and thatthose weak constitutions, which are attended with cold extremities andlarge pupils of the eyes, may possess less mobility of the contractilefibres, as well as less quantity of exertion of the spirit of animation."|FALSE
15707|"In answer to this mode of reasoning it may be sufficient to observe, thatthe contractile fibres consist of inert matter, and when the sensorialpower is withdrawn, as in death, they possess no power of motion at all,but remain in their last state, whether of contraction or relaxation, andmust thence derive the whole of this property from the spirit of animation.At the same time it is not improbable, that the moving fibres of strongpeople may possess a capability of receiving or containing a greaterquantity of the spirit of animation than those of weak people."|FALSE
15707|"In every contraction of a fibre there is an expenditure of the sensorialpower, or spirit of animation; and where the exertion of this sensorialpower has been for some time increased, and the muscles or organs of sensehave in consequence acted with greater energy, its propensity to activityis proportionally lessened; which is to be ascribed to the exhaustion ordiminution of its quantity. On the contrary, where there has been lessfibrous contraction than usual for a certain time, the sensorial power orspirit of animation becomes accumulated in the inactive part of the system.Hence vigour succeeds rest, and hence the propensity to action of all ourorgans of sense and muscles is in a state of perpetual fluctuation. Theirritability for instance of the retina, that is, its quantity of sensorialpower, varies every moment according to the brightness or obscurity of theobject last beheld compared with the present one. The same occurs to oursense of heat, and to every part of our system, which is capable of beingexcited into action."|FALSE
15707|"When this variation of the exertion of the sensorial power becomes much andpermanently above or beneath the natural quantity, it becomes a disease. Ifthe irritative motions be too great or too little, it shews that thestimulus of external things affect this sensorial power too violently ortoo inertly. If the sensitive motions be too great or too little, the causearises from the deficient or exuberant quantity of sensation produced inconsequence of the motions of the muscular fibres or organs of sense; ifthe voluntary actions are diseased the cause is to be looked for in thequantity of volition produced in consequence of the desire or aversionoccasioned by the painful or pleasurable sensations above mentioned. Andthe diseases of associations probably depend on the greater or lessquantity of the other three sensorial powers by which they were formed."|FALSE
15707|"From whence it appears that the propensity to action, whether it be calledirritability, sensibility, voluntarity, or associability, is only anothermode of expression for the quantity of sensorial power residing in theorgan to be excited. And that on the contrary the words inirritability andinsensibility, together with inaptitude to voluntary and associate motions,are synonymous with deficiency of the quantity of sensorial power, or ofthe spirit of animation, residing in the organs to be excited."|FALSE
15707|"II. _Of sensorial Exertion._"|FALSE
15707|"1. There are three circumstances to be attended to in the production ofanimal motions, 1st. The stimulus. 2d. The sensorial power. 3d. Thecontractile fibre. 1st. A stimulus, external to the organ, originallyinduces into action the sensorial faculty termed irritation; this producesthe contraction of the fibres, which, if it be perceived at all, introducespleasure or pain; which in their active state are termed sensation; whichis another sensorial faculty, and occasionally produces contraction of thefibres; this pleasure or pain is therefore to be considered as anotherstimulus, which may either act alone or in conjunction with the formerfaculty of the sensorium termed irritation."|FALSE
15707|"This new stimulus of pleasure or pain either induces into action thesensorial faculty termed sensation, which then produces the contraction ofthe fibres; or it introduces desire or aversion, which excite into actionanother sensorial faculty, termed volition, and may therefore be consideredas another stimulus, which either alone or in conjunction with one or bothof the two former faculties of the sensorium produces the contraction ofanimal fibres. There is another sensorial power, that of association, whichperpetually, in conjunction with one or more of the above, and frequentlysingly, produces the contraction of animal fibres, and which is itselfexcited into action by the previous motions of contracting fibres."|FALSE
15707|"Now as the sensorial power, termed irritation, residing in any particularfibres, is excited into exertion by the stimulus of external bodies actingon those fibres; the sensorial power, termed sensation, residing in anyparticular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of pleasure orpain acting on those fibres; the sensorial power, termed volition, residingin any particular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of desireor aversion; and the sensorial power, termed association, residing in anyparticular fibres, is excited into action by the stimulus of other fibrousmotions, which had frequently preceded them. The word stimulus maytherefore be used without impropriety of language, for any of these fourcauses, which excite the four sensorial powers into exertion. For thoughthe immediate cause of volition has generally been termed _a motive_; andthat of irritation only has generally obtained the name of _stimulus_; yetas the immediate cause, which excites the sensorial powers of sensation, orof association into exertion, have obtained no general name, we shall usethe word stimulus for them all."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the quantity of motion produced in any particular part of the animalsystem will be as the quantity of stimulus and the quantity of sensorialpower, or spirit of animation, residing in the contracting fibres. Whereboth these quantities are great, _strength_ is produced, when that word isapplied to the motions of animal bodies. Where either of them is deficient,_weakness_ is produced, as applied to the motions of animal bodies."|FALSE
15707|"Now as the sensorial power, or spirit of animation, is perpetuallyexhausted by the expenditure of it in fibrous contractions, and isperpetually renewed by the secretion or production of it in the brain andspinal marrow, the quantity of animal strength must be in a perpetual stateof fluctuation on this account; and if to this be added the unceasingvariation of all the four kinds of stimulus above described, which producethe exertions of the sensorial powers, the ceaseless vicissitude of animalstrength becomes easily comprehended."|FALSE
15707|"If the quantity of sensorial power remains the same, and the quantity ofstimulus be lessened, a weakness of the fibrous contractions ensues, whichmay be denominated _debility from defect of stimulus_. If the quantity ofstimulus remains the same, and the quantity of sensorial power be lessened,another kind of weakness ensues, which may be termed _debility from defectof sensorial power_; the former of these is called by Dr. Brown, in hisElements of Medicine, direct debility, and the latter indirect debility.The coincidence of some parts of this work with correspondent deductions inthe Brunonian Elementa Medicina, a work (with some exceptions) of greatgenius, must be considered as confirmations of the truth of the theory, asthey were probably arrived at by different trains of reasoning."|FALSE
15707|"Thus in those who have been exposed to cold and hunger there is adeficiency of stimulus. While in nervous fever there is a deficiency ofsensorial power. And in habitual drunkards, in a morning before their usualpotation, there is a deficiency both of stimulus and of sensorial power.While, on the other hand, in the beginning of intoxication there is anexcess of stimulus; in the hot-ach, after the hands have been immersed insnow, there is a redundancy of sensorial power; and in inflammatorydiseases with arterial strength, there is an excess of both."|FALSE
15707|"Hence if the sensorial power be lessened, while the quantity of stimulusremains the same as in nervous fever, the frequency of repetition of thearterial contractions may continue, but their force in respect to removingobstacles, as in promoting the circulation of the blood, or the velocity ofeach contraction, will be diminished, that is, the animal strength will belessened. And secondly, if the quantity of sensorial power be lessened, andthe stimulus be increased to a certain degree, as in giving opium innervous fevers, the arterial contractions may be performed more frequentlythan natural, yet with less strength."|FALSE
15707|"And thirdly, if the sensorial power continues the same in respect toquantity, and the stimulus be somewhat diminished, as in going into adarkish room, or into a coldish bath, suppose of about eighty degrees ofheat, as Buxton-bath, a temporary weakness of the affected fibres isinduced, till an accumulation of sensorial power gradually succeeds, andcounterbalances the deficiency of stimulus, and then the bath ceases tofeel cold, and the room ceases to appear dark; because the fibres of thesubcutaneous vessels, or of the organs of sense, act with their usualenergy."|FALSE
15707|"A set of muscular fibres may thus be stimulated into violent exertion, thatis, they may act frequently, and with their whole sensorial power, but maynevertheless not act strongly; because the quantity of their sensorialpower was originally small, or was previously exhausted. Hence a stimulusmay be great, and the irritation in consequence act with its full force, asin the hot paroxysms of nervous fever; but if the sensorial power, termedirritation, be small in quantity, the force of the fibrous contractions,and the times of their continuance in their contracted state, will beproportionally small."|FALSE
15707|"In the same manner in the hot paroxysm of putrid fevers, which are shewn inSect. XXXIII. to be inflammatory fevers with arterial debility, thesensorial power termed sensation is exerted with great activity, yet thefibrous contractions, which produce the circulation of the blood, areperformed without strength, because the quantity of sensorial power thenresiding in that part of the system is small."|FALSE
15707|"Thus in irritative fever with arterial strength, that is, with excess ofspirit of animation, the quantity of exertion during the hot part of theparoxysm is to be estimated from the quantity of stimulus, and the quantityof sensorial power. While in sensitive (or inflammatory) fever witharterial strength, that is, with excess of spirit of animation, the violentand forcible actions of the vascular system during the hot part of theparoxysm are induced by the exertions of two sensorial powers, which areexcited by two kinds of stimulus. These are the sensorial power ofirritation excited by the stimulus of bodies external to the moving fibres,and the sensorial power of sensation excited by the pain in consequence ofthe increased contractions of those moving fibres."|FALSE
15707|"And in insane people in some cases the force of their muscular actions willbe in proportion to the quantity of sensorial power, which they possess,and the quantity of the stimulus of desire or aversion, which excites theirvolition into action. At the same time in other cases the stimulus of painor pleasure, and the stimulus of external bodies, may excite into actionthe sensorial powers of sensation and irritation, and thus add greaterforce to their muscular actions."|FALSE
15707|"2. The application of the stimulus, whether that stimulus be some qualityof external bodies, or pleasure or pain, or desire or aversion, or a linkof association, excites the correspondent sensorial power into action, andthis causes the contraction of the fibre. On the contraction of the fibre apart of the spirit of animation becomes expended, and the fibre ceases tocontract, though the stimulus continues to be applied; till in a certaintime the fibre having received a supply of sensorial power is ready tocontract again, if the stimulus continues to be applied. If the stimulus onthe contrary be withdrawn, the same quantity of quiescent sensorial powerbecomes resident in the fibre as before its contraction; as appears fromthe readiness for action of the large locomotive muscles of the body in ashort time after common exertion."|FALSE
15707|"But in those muscular fibres, which are subject to constant stimulus, asthe arteries, glands, and capillary vessels, another phenomenon occurs, iftheir accustomed stimulus be withdrawn; which is, that the sensorial powerbecomes accumulated in the contractile fibres, owing to the want of itsbeing perpetually expended, or carried away, by their usual unremittedcontractions. And on this account those muscular fibres become afterwardsexcitable into their natural actions by a much weaker stimulus; or intounnatural violence of action by their accustomed stimulus, as is seen inthe hot fits of intermittent fevers, which are in consequence of theprevious cold ones. Thus the minute vessels of the skin are constantlystimulated by the fluid matter of heat; if the quantity of this stimulus ofheat be a while diminished, as in covering the hands with snow, the vesselscease to act, as appears from the paleness of the skin; if this coldapplication of snow be continued but a short time, the sensorial power,which had habitually been supplied to the fibres, becomes now accumulatedin them, owing to the want of its being expended by their accustomedcontractions. And thence a less stimulus of heat will now excite them intoviolent contractions."|FALSE
15707|"If the quiescence of fibres, which had previously been subject to perpetualstimulus, continues a longer time; or their accustomed stimulus be morecompletely withdrawn; the accumulation of sensorial power becomes stillgreater, as in those exposed to cold and hunger; pain is produced, and theorgan gradually dies from the chemical changes, which take place in it; orit is at a great distance of time restored to action by stimulus appliedwith great caution in small quantity, as happens to some larger animals andto many insects, which during the winter months lie benumbed with cold, andare said to sleep, and to persons apparently drowned, or apparently frozento death. Snails have been said to revive by throwing them into water afterhaving been many years shut up in the cabinets of the curious; and eggs andseeds in general are restored to life after many months of torpor by thestimulus of warmth and moisture."|FALSE
15707|"The inflammation of schirrous tumours, which have long existed in a stateof inaction, is a process of this kind; as well as the sensibility acquiredby inflamed tendons and bones, which had at their formation a similarsensibility, which had so long lain dormant in their uninflamed state."|FALSE
15707|"3. If after long quiescence from defect of stimulus the fibres, which hadpreviously been habituated to perpetual stimulus, are again exposed to buttheir usual quantity of it; as in those who have suffered the extremes ofcold or hunger; a violent exertion of the affected organ commences, owing,as above explained, to the great accumulation of sensorial power. Thisviolent exertion not only diminishes the accumulated spirit of animation,but at the same time induces pleasure or pain into the system, which,whether it be succeeded by inflammation or not, becomes an additionalstimulus, and acting along with the former one, produces still greaterexertions; and thus reduces the sensorial power in the contracting fibresbeneath its natural quantity."|FALSE
15707|"When the spirit of animation is thus exhausted by useless exertions, theorgan becomes torpid or unexcitable into action, and a second fit ofquiescence succeeds that of abundant activity. During this second fit ofquiescence the sensorial power becomes again accumulated, and another fitof exertion follows in train. These vicissitudes of exertion and inertionof the arterial system constitute the paroxysms of remittent fevers; orintermittent ones, when there is an interval of the natural action of thearteries between the exacerbations."|FALSE
15707|"In these paroxysms of fevers, which consist of the libration of thearterial system between the extremes of exertion and quiescence, either thefits become less and less violent from the contractile fibres becomingcoming less excitable to the stimulus by habit, that is, by becomingaccustomed to it, as explained below XII. 3. 1. or the whole sensorialpower becomes exhausted, and the arteries cease to beat, and the patientdies in the cold part of the paroxysm. Or secondly, so much pain isintroduced into the system by the violent contractions of the fibres, thatinflammation arises, which prevents future cold fits by expending a part ofthe sensorial power in the extension of old vessels or the production ofnew ones; and thus preventing the too great accumulation or exertion of itin other parts of the system; or which by the great increase of stimulusexcites into great action the whole glandular system as well as thearterial, and thence a greater quantity of sensorial power is produced inthe brain, and thus its exhaustion in any peculiar part of the systemceases to be affected."|FALSE
15707|"4. Or thirdly, in consequence of the painful or pleasurable sensation abovementioned, desire and aversion are introduced, and inordinate volitionsucceeds; which by its own exertions expends so much of the spirit ofanimation, that the two other sensorial faculties, or irritation andsensation, act so much more feebly; that the paroxysms of fever, or thatlibration between the extremes of exertion and inactivity of the arterialsystem, gradually subsides. On this account a temporary insanity is afavourable sign in fevers, as I have had some opportunities of observing."|FALSE
15707|"III. _Of repeated Stimulus._"|FALSE
15707|"1. When a stimulus is repeated more frequently than the expenditure ofsensorial power can be renewed in the acting organ, the effect of thestimulus becomes gradually diminished. Thus if two grains of opium beswallowed by a person unused to so strong a stimulus, all the vascularsystems in the body act with greater energy, all the secretions and theabsorption from those secreted fluids are increased in quantity; andpleasure or pain are introduced into the system, which adds an additionalstimulus to that already too great. After some hours the sensorial powerbecomes diminished in quantity, expended by the great activity of thesystem; and thence, when the stimulus of the opium is withdrawn, the fibreswill not obey their usual degree of natural stimulus, and a consequenttorpor or quiescence succeeds, as is experienced by drunkards, who on theday after a great excess of spirituous potation feel indigestion, head-ach,and general debility."|FALSE
15707|"In this fit of torpor or quiescence of a part or of the whole of thesystem, an accumulation of the sensorial power in the affected fibres isformed, and occasions a second paroxysm of exertion by the application onlyof the natural stimulus, and thus a libration of the sensorial exertionbetween one excess and the other continues for two or three days, where thestimulus was violent in degree; and for weeks in some fevers, from thestimulus of contagious matter."|FALSE
15707|"But if a second dose of opium be exhibited before the fibres have regainedtheir natural quantity of sensorial power, its effect will be much lessthan the former, because the spirit of animation or sensorial power is inpart exhausted by the previous excess of exertion. Hence all medicinesrepeated too frequently gradually lose their effect, as opium and wine.Many things of disagreeable taste at first cease to be disagreeable byfrequent repetition, as tobacco; grief and pain gradually diminish, and atlength cease altogether, and hence life itself becomes tolerable."|FALSE
15707|"Besides the temporary diminution of the spirit of animation or sensorialpower, which is naturally stationary or resident in every living fibre, bya single exhibition of a powerful stimulus, the contractile fibresthemselves, by the perpetual application of a new quantity of stimulus,before they have regained their natural quantity of sensorial power, appearto suffer in their capability of receiving so much as the natural quantityof sensorial power; and hence a permanent deficiency of spirit of animationtakes place, however long the stimulus may have been withdrawn. On thiscause depends the permanent debility of those, who have been addicted tointoxication, the general weakness of old age, and the natural debility orinirritability of those, who have pale skins and large pupils of theireyes."|FALSE
15707|"There is a curious phenomenon belongs to this place, which has alwaysappeared difficult of solution; and that is, that opium or aloes may beexhibited in small doses at first, and gradually increased to very largeones without producing stupor or diarrhoea. In this case, though the opiumand aloes are given in such small doses as not to produce intoxication orcatharsis, yet they are exhibited in quantities sufficient in some degreeto exhaust the sensorial power, and hence a stronger and a stronger dose isrequired; otherwise the medicine would soon cease to act at all."|FALSE
15707|"On the contrary, if the opium or aloes be exhibited in a large dose atfirst, so as to produce intoxication or diarrhoea; after a few repetitionsthe quantity of either of them may be diminished, and they will stillproduce this effect. For the more powerful stimulus dissevers theprogressive catenations of animal motions, described in Sect. XVII. andintroduces a new link between them; whence every repetition strengthensthis new association or catenation, and the stimulus may be graduallydecreased, or be nearly withdrawn, and yet the effect shall continue;because the sensorial power of association or catenation being united withthe stimulus, increases in energy with every repetition of the catenatedcircle; and it is by these means that all the irritative associations ofmotions are originally produced."|FALSE
15707|"2. When a stimulus is repeated at such distant intervals of time, that thenatural quantity of sensorial power becomes completely restored in theacting fibres, it will act with the same energy as when first applied.Hence those who have lately accustomed themselves to large doses of opiumby beginning with small ones, and gradually increasing them, and repeatingthem frequently, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph; if they intermitthe use of it for a few days only, must begin again with as small doses asthey took at first, otherwise they will experience the inconveniences ofintoxication."|FALSE
15707|"On this circumstance depend the constant unfailing effects of the variouskinds of stimulus, which excite into action all the vascular systems in thebody; the arterial, venous, absorbent, and glandular vessels, are broughtinto perpetual unwearied action by the fluids, which are adapted tostimulate them; but these have the sensorial power of association added tothat of irritation, and even in some degree that of sensation, and even ofvolition, as will be spoken of in their places; and life itself is thuscarried on by the production of sensorial power being equal to its waste orexpenditure in the perpetual movement of the vascular organization."|FALSE
15707|"3. When a stimulus is repeated at uniform intervals of time with suchdistances between them, that the expenditure of sensorial power in theacting fibres becomes completely renewed, the effect is produced withgreater facility or energy. For the sensorial power of association iscombined with the sensorial power of irritation, or, in common language,the acquired habit assists the power of the stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"This circumstance not only obtains in the annual and diurnal catenations ofanimal motions explained in Sect. XXXVI. but in every less circle ofactions or ideas, as in the burthen of a song, or the iterations of adance; and constitutes the pleasure we receive from repetition andimitation; as treated of in Sect. XXII. 2."|FALSE
15707|"4. When a stimulus has been many times repeated at uniform intervals, so asto produce the complete action of the organ, it may then be graduallydiminished, or totally withdrawn, and the action of the organ willcontinue. For the sensorial power of association becomes united with thatof irritation, and by frequent repetition becomes at length of sufficientenergy to carry on the new link in the circle of actions, without theirritation which at first introduced it."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, when the bark is given at stated intervals for the cure ofintermittent fevers, if sixty grains of it be given every three hours forthe twenty-four hours preceding the expected paroxysm, so as to stimulatethe defective part of the system into action, and by that means to preventthe torpor or quiescence of the fibres, which constitutes the cold fit;much less than half the quantity, given before the time at which anotherparoxysm of quiescence would have taken place, will be sufficient toprevent it; because now the sensorial power, termed association, acts in atwofold manner. First, in respect to the period of the catenation in whichthe cold fit was produced, which is now dissevered by the stronger stimulusof the first doses of the bark; and, secondly, because each dose of barkbeing repeated at periodical times, has its effect increased by thesensorial faculty of association being combined with that of irritation."|FALSE
15707|"Now, when sixty grains of Peruvian bark are taken twice a day, suppose atten o'clock and at six, for a fortnight, the irritation excited by thisadditional stimulus becomes a part of the diurnal circle of actions, andwill at length carry on the increased action of the system without theassistance of the stimulus of the bark. On this theory the bittermedicines, chalybeates, and opiates in appropriated doses, exhibited for afortnight, give permanent strength to pale feeble children, and other weakconstitutions."|FALSE
15707|"5. When a defect of stimulus, as of heat, recurs at certain diurnalintervals, which induces some torpor or quiescence of a part of the system,the diurnal catenation of actions becomes disordered, and a new associationwith this link of torpid action is formed; on the next period the quantityof quiescence will be increased, suppose the same defect of stimulus torecur, because now the new association conspires with the defectiveirritation in introducing the torpid action of this part of the diurnalcatenation. In this manner many fever-fits commence, where the patient isfor some days indisposed at certain hours, before the cold paroxysm offever is completely formed. See Sect. XVII. 3. 3. on Catenation of AnimalMotions."|FALSE
15707|"6. If a stimulus, which at first excited the affected organ into so greatexertion as to produce sensation, be continued for a certain time, it willcease to produce sensation both then and when repeated, though theirritative motions in consequence of it may continue or be re-excited."|FALSE
15707|"Many catenations of irritative motions were at first succeeded bysensation, as the apparent motions of objects when we walk past them, andprobably the vital motions themselves in the early state of our existence.But as those sensations were followed by no movements of the system inconsequence of them, they gradually ceased to be produced, not being joinedto any succeeding link of catenation. Hence contagious matter, which hasfor some weeks stimulated the system into great and permanent sensation,ceases afterwards to produce general sensation, or inflammation, though itmay still induce topical irritations. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 8. XIX. 9."|FALSE
15707|"Our absorbent system then seems to receive those contagious matters, whichit has before experienced, in the same manner as it imbibes common moistureor other fluids; that is, without being thrown into so violent action as toproduce sensation; the consequence of which is an increase of daily energyor activity, till inflammation and its consequences succeed."|FALSE
15707|"7. If a stimulus excites an organ into such violent contractions as toproduce sensation, the motions of which organ had not usually producedsensation, this new sensorial power, added to the irritation occasioned bythe stimulus, increases the activity of the organ. And if this activity becatenated with the diurnal circle of actions, an increasing inflammation isproduced; as in the evening paroxysms of small-pox, and other fevers withinflammation. And hence schirrous tumours, tendons and membranes, andprobably the arteries themselves become inflamed, when they are stronglystimulated."|FALSE
15707|"IV. _Of Stimulus greater than natural._"|FALSE
15707|"1. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increasedexertion of sensorial power, whether that exertion be in the mode ofirritation, sensation, volition, or association, diminishes the generalquantity of it. This fact is observable in the progress of intoxication, asthe increased quantity or energy of the irritative motions, owing to thestimulus of vinous spirit, introduces much pleasurable sensation into thesystem, and much exertion of muscular or sensual motions in consequence ofthis increased sensation; the voluntary motions, and even the associateones, become much impaired or diminished; and delirium and staggeringsucceed. See Sect. XXI. on Drunkenness. And hence the great prostration ofthe strength of the locomotive muscles in some fevers, is owing to theexhaustion of sensorial power by the increased action of the arterialsystem."|FALSE
15707|"In like manner a stimulus greater than natural, applied to a part of thesystem, increases the exertion of sensorial power in that part, anddiminishes it in some other part. As in the commencement of scarlet fever,it is usual to see great redness and heat on the faces and breasts ofchildren, while at the same time their feet are colder than natural;partial heats are observable in other fevers with debility, and aregenerally attended with torpor or quiescence of some other part of thesystem. But these partial exertions of sensorial power are sometimesattended with increased partial exertions in other parts of the system,which sympathize with them, as the flushing of the face after a full meal.Both these therefore are to be ascribed to sympathetic associations,explained in Sect. XXXV. and not to general exhaustion or accumulation ofsensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"2. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increasedexertion of sensorial power in any particular organ, diminishes thequantity of it in that organ. This appears from the contractions of animalfibres being not so easily excited by a less stimulus after the organ hasbeen subjected to a greater. Thus after looking at any luminous object of asmall size, as at the setting sun, for a short time, so as not much tofatigue the eye, this part of the retina becomes less sensible to smallerquantities of light; hence when the eyes are turned on other less luminousparts of the sky, a dark spot is seen resembling the shape of the sun, orother luminous object which we last behold. See Sect. XL. No. 2."|FALSE
15707|"Thus we are some time before we can distinguish objects in an obscure roomafter coming from bright day-light, though the iris presently contractsitself. We are not able to hear weak sounds after loud ones. And thestomachs of those who have been much habituated to the stronger stimulus offermented or spirituous liquors, are not excited into due action by weakerones."|FALSE
15707|"3. A quantity of stimulus something greater than the last mentioned, orlonger continued, induces the organ into spasmodic action, which ceases andrecurs alternately. Thus on looking for a time on the setting sun, so asnot greatly to fatigue the sight, a yellow spectrum is seen when the eyesare closed and covered, which continues for a time, and then disappears andrecurs repeatedly before it entirely vanishes. See Sect. XL. No. 5. Thusthe action of vomiting ceases and is renewed by intervals, although theemetic drug is thrown up with the first effort. A tenesmus continues byintervals some time after the exclusion of acrid excrement; and thepulsations of the heart of a viper are said to continue some time after itis cleared from its blood."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce painaccording to law 4; and this pain constitutes an additional kind orquantity of excitement, which again induces the fibres into contraction,and which painful excitement is again renewed, and again inducescontractions of the fibres with gradually diminishing effect."|FALSE
15707|"4. A quantity of stimulus greater than that last mentioned, or longercontinued, induces the antagonist muscles into spasmodic action. This isbeautifully illustrated by the ocular spectra described in Sect. XL. No. 6.to which the reader is referred. From those experiments there is reason toconclude that the fatigued part of the retina throws itself into a contrarymode of action like oscitation or pandiculation, as soon as the stimulus,which has fatigued it, is withdrawn; but that it still remains liable to beexcited into action by any other colours except the colour with which ithas been fatigued. Thus the yawning and stretching the limbs after acontinued action or attitude seems occasioned by the antagonist musclesbeing stimulated by their extension during the contractions of those inaction, or in the situation in which that action last left them."|FALSE
15707|"5. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,induces variety of convulsions or fixed spasms either of the affected organor of the moving fibres in the other parts of the body. In respect to thespectra in the eye, this is well illustrated in No. 7 and 8, of Sect. XL.Epileptic convulsions, as the emprosthotonos and opisthotonos, with thecramp of the calf of the leg, locked jaw, and other cataleptic fits, appearto originate from pain, as some of these patients scream aloud before theconvulsion takes place; which seems at first to be an effort to relievepainful sensation, and afterwards an effort to prevent it."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce so much pain,as to constitute a perpetual excitement; and that in so great a degree asto allow but small intervals of relaxation of the contracting fibres as inconvulsions, or no intervals at all as in fixed spasms."|FALSE
15707|"6. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,produces a paralysis of the organ. In many cases this paralysis is only atemporary effect, as on looking long on a small area of bright red silkplaced on a sheet of white paper on the floor in a strong light, the redsilk gradually becomes paler, and at length disappears; which evinces thata part of the retina, by being violently excited, becomes for a timeunaffected by the stimulus of that colour. Thus cathartic medicines,opiates, poisons, contagious matter, cease to influence our system after ithas been habituated to the use of them, except by the exhibition ofincreased quantities of them; our fibres not only become unaffected bystimuli, by which they have previously been violently irritated, as by thematter of the small-pox or measles; but they also become unaffected bysensation, where the violent exertions, which disabled them, were inconsequence of too great quantity of sensation. And lastly the fibres,which become disobedient to volition, are probably disabled by their tooviolent exertions in consequence of too great a quantity of volition."|FALSE
15707|"After every exertion of our fibres a temporary paralysis succeeds, whencethe intervals of all muscular contractions, as mentioned in No. 3 and 4 ofthis Section; the immediate cause of these more permanent kinds ofparalysis is probably owing in the same manner to the too great exhaustionof the spirit of animation in the affected part; so that a strongerstimulus is required, or one of a different kind from that, whichoccasioned those too violent contractions, to again excite the affectedorgan into activity; and if a stronger stimulus could be applied, it mustagain induce paralysis."|FALSE
15707|"For these powerful stimuli excite pain at the same time, that they produceirritation; and this pain not only excites fibrous motions by its stimulus,but it also produces volition; and thus all these stimuli acting at thesame time, and sometimes with the addition of their associations, produceso great exertion as to expend the whole of the sensorial power in theaffected fibres."|FALSE
15707|"V. _Of Stimulus less than natural._"|FALSE
15707|"1. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, producing a decreased exertionof sensorial power, occasions an accumulation of the general quantity ofit. This circumstance is observable in the hemiplagia, in which thepatients are perpetually moving the muscles, which are unaffected. On thisaccount we awake with greater vigour after sleep, because during so manyhours, the great usual expenditure of sensorial power in the performance ofvoluntary actions, and in the exertions of our organs of sense, inconsequence of the irritations occasioned by external objects had beensuspended, and a consequent accumulation had taken place."|FALSE
15707|"In like manner the exertion of the sensorial power less than natural in onepart of the system, is liable to produce an increase of the exertion of itin some other part. Thus by the action of vomiting, in which the naturalexertion of the motions of the stomach are destroyed or diminished, anincreased absorption of the pulmonary and cellular lymphatics is produced,as is known by the increased absorption of the fluid deposited in them indropsical cases. But these partial quiescences of sensorial power are alsosometimes attended with other partial quiescences, which sympathize withthem, as cold and pale extremities from hunger. These therefore are to beascribed to the associations of sympathy explained in Sect. XXXV. and notto the general accumulation of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"2. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, applied to fibres previouslyaccustomed to perpetual stimulus, is succeeded by accumulation of sensorialpower in the affected organ. The truth of this proposition is evinced,because a stimulus less than natural, if it be somewhat greater than thatabove mentioned, will excite the organ so circumstanced into violentactivity. Thus on a frosty day with wind, the face of a person exposed tothe wind is at first pale and shrunk; but on turning the face from thewind, it becomes soon of a glow with warmth and flushing. The glow of theskin in emerging from the cold-bath is owing to the same cause."|FALSE
15707|"It does not appear, that an accumulation of sensorial power above thenatural quantity is acquired by those muscles, which are not subject toperpetual stimulus, as the locomotive muscles: these, after the greatestfatigue, only acquire by rest their usual aptitude to motion; whereas thevascular system, as the heart and arteries, after a short quiescence, arethrown into violent action by their natural quantity of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"Nevertheless by this accumulation of sensorial power during the applicationof decreased stimulus, and by the exhaustion of it during the action ofincreased stimulus, it is wisely provided, that the actions of the vascularmuscles and organs of sense are not much deranged by small variations ofstimulus; as the quantity of sensorial power becomes in some measureinversely as the quantity of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"3. A quantity of stimulus less than that mentioned above, and continued forsome time, induces pain in the affected organ, as the pain of cold in thehands, when they are immersed in snow, is owing to a deficiency of thestimulation of heat. Hunger is a pain from the deficiency of thestimulation of food. Pain in the back at the commencement of ague-fits, andthe head-achs which attend feeble people, are pains from defect ofstimulus, and are hence relieved by opium, essential oils, spirit of wine."|FALSE
15707|"As the pains, which originate from defect of stimulus, only occur in thoseparts of the system, which have been previously subjected to perpetualstimulus; and as an accumulation of sensorial power is produced in thequiescent organ along with the pain, as in cold or hunger, there is reasonto believe, that the pain is owing to the accumulation of sensorial power.For, in the locomotive muscles, in the retina of the eye, and other organsof senses, no pain occurs from the absence of stimulus, nor any greataccumulation of sensorial power beyond their natural quantity, since theseorgans have not been used to a perpetual supply of it. There is indeed agreater accumulation occurs in the organ of vision after its quiescence,because it is subject to more constant stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"4. A certain quantity of stimulus less than natural induces the movingorgan into feebler and more frequent contractions, as mentioned in No. I.4. of this Section. For each contraction moving through a less space, orwith less force, that is, with less expenditure of the spirit of animation,is sooner relaxed, and the spirit of animation derived at each intervalinto the acting fibres being less, these intervals likewise become shorter.Hence the tremours of the hands of people accustomed to vinous spirit, tillthey take their usual stimulus; hence the quick pulse in fevers attendedwith debility, which is greater than in fevers attended with strength; inthe latter the pulse seldom beats above 120 times in a minute, in theformer it frequently exceeds 140."|FALSE
15707|"It must be observed, that in this and the two following articles thedecreased action of the system is probably more frequently occasioned bydeficiency in the quantity of sensorial power, than in the quantity ofstimulus. Thus those feeble constitutions which have large pupils of theireyes, and all who labour under nervous fevers, seem to owe their want ofnatural quantity of activity in the system to the deficiency of sensorialpower; since, as far as can be seen, they frequently possess the naturalquantity of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"5. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, invertsthe order of successive fibrous contractions; as in vomiting the vermicularmotions of the stomach and duodenum are inverted, and their contentsejected, which is probably owing to the exhaustion of the spirit ofanimation in the acting muscles by a previous excessive stimulus, as by theroot of ipecacuanha, and the consequent defect of sensorial power. The sameretrograde motions affect the whole intestinal canal in ileus; and theoesophagus in globus hystericus. See this further explained in Sect. XXIX.No. 11. on Retrograde Motions."|FALSE
15707|"I must observe, also, that something similar happens in the production ofour ideas, or sensual motions, when they are too weakly excited; when anyone is thinking intensely about one thing, and carelessly conversing aboutanother, he is liable to use the word of a contrary meaning to that whichhe designed, as cold weather for hot weather, summer for winter."|FALSE
15707|"6. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, issucceeded by paralysis, first of the voluntary and sensitive motions, andafterwards of those of irritation, and of association, which constitutesdeath."|FALSE
15707|"VI. _Cure of increased Exertion._"|FALSE
15707|"1. The cure, which nature has provided for the increased exertion of anypart of the system, consists in the consequent expenditure of the sensorialpower. But as a greater torpor follows this exhaustion of sensorial power,as explained in the next paragraph, and a greater exertion succeeds thistorpor, the constitution frequently sinks under these increasing librationsbetween exertion and quiescence; till at length complete quiescence, thatis, death, closes the scene."|FALSE
15707|"For, during the great exertion of the system in the hot fit of fever, anincrease of stimulus is produced from the greater momentum of the blood,the greater distention of the heart and arteries, and the increasedproduction of heat, by the violent actions of the system occasioned by thisaugmentation of stimulus, the sensorial power becomes diminished in a fewhours much beneath its natural quantity, the vessels at length cease toobey even these great degrees of stimulus, as shewn in Sect. XL. 9. 1. anda torpor of the whole or of a part of the system ensues."|FALSE
15707|"Now as this second cold fit commences with a greater deficiency ofsensorial power, it is also attended with a greater deficiency of stimulusthan in the preceding cold fit, that is, with less momentum of blood, lessdistention of the heart. On this account the second cold fit becomes moreviolent and of longer duration than the first; and as a greateraccumulation of sensorial power must be produced before the system ofvessels will again obey the diminished stimulus, it follows, that thesecond hot fit of fever will be more violent than the former one. And thatunless some other causes counteract either the violent exertions in the hotfit, or the great torpor in the cold fit, life will at length beextinguished by the expenditure of the whole of the sensorial power. Andfrom hence it appears, that the true means of curing fevers must be such asdecrease the action of the system in the hot fit, and increase it in thecold fit; that is, such as prevent the too great diminution of sensorialpower in the hot fit, and the too great accumulation of it in the cold one."|FALSE
15707|"2. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much increased, as in thehot fits of fever or inflammation, the following are the usual means ofrelieving it. Decrease the irritations by blood-letting, and otherevacuations; by cold water taken into the stomach, or injected as an enema,or used externally; by cold air breathed into the lungs, and diffused overthe skin; with food of less stimulus than the patient has been accustomedto."|FALSE
15707|"3. As a cold fit, or paroxysm of inactivity of some parts of the system,generally precedes the hot fit, or paroxysm of exertion, by which thesensorial power becomes accumulated, this cold paroxysm should be preventedby stimulant medicines and diet, as wine, opium, bark, warmth,cheerfulness, anger, surprise."|FALSE
15707|"4. Excite into greater action some other part of the system, by which meansthe spirit of animation may be in part expended, and thence the inordinateactions of the diseased part may be lessened. Hence when a part of the skinacts violently, as of the face in the eruption of the small-pox, if thefeet be cold they should be covered. Hence the use of a blister appliednear a topical inflammation. Hence opium and warm bath relieve pains bothfrom excess and defect of stimulus."|FALSE
15707|"5. First increase the general stimulation above its natural quantity, whichmay in some degree exhaust the spirit of animation, and then decrease thestimulation beneath its natural quantity. Hence after sudorific medicinesand warm air, the application of refrigerants may have greater effect, ifthey could be administered without danger of producing too great torpor ofsome part of the system; as frequently happens to people in health fromcoming out of a warm room into the cold air, by which a topicalinflammation in consequence of torpor of the mucous membrane of the nostrilis produced, and is termed a cold in the head."|FALSE
15707|"VII. _Cure of decreased Exertion._"|FALSE
15707|"1. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much decreased, as in thecold fits of fever, a gradual accumulation of the spirit of animation takesplace; as occurs in all cases where inactivity or torpor of a part of thesystem exists; this accumulation of sensorial power increases, till stimuliless than natural are sufficient to throw it into action, then the cold fitceases; and from the action of the natural stimuli a hot one succeeds withincreased activity of the whole system."|FALSE
15707|"So in fainting fits, or syncope, there is a temporary deficiency ofsensorial exertion, and a consequent quiescence of a great part of thesystem. This quiescence continues, till the sensorial power becomes againaccumulated in the torpid organs; and then the usual diurnal stimuli excitethe revivescent parts again into action; but as this kind of quiescencecontinues but a short time compared to the cold paroxysm of an ague, andless affects the circulatory system, a less superabundancy of exertionsucceeds in the organs previously torpid, and a less excess of arterialactivity. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 6."|FALSE
15707|"2. In the diseases occasioned by a defect of sensorial exertion, as in coldfits of ague, hysteric complaint, and nervous fever, the following meansare those commonly used. 1. Increase the stimulation above its naturalquantity for some weeks, till a new habit of more energetic contraction ofthe fibres is established. This is to be done by wine, opium, bark, steel,given at exact periods, and in appropriate quantities; for if thesemedicines be given in such quantity, as to induce the least degree ofintoxication, a debility succeeds from the useless exhaustion of spirit ofanimation in consequence of too great exertion of the muscles or organs ofsense. To these irritative stimuli should be added the sensitive ones ofcheerful ideas, hope, affection."|FALSE
15707|"3. Change the kinds of stimulus. The habits acquired by the constitutiondepend on such nice circumstances, that when one kind of stimulus ceases toexcite the sensorial power into the quantity of exertion necessary tohealth, it is often sufficient to change the stimulus for anotherapparently similar in quantity and quality. Thus when wine ceases tostimulate the constitution, opium in appropriate doses supplies the defect;and the contrary. This is also observed in the effects of catharticmedicines, when one loses its power, another, apparently less efficacious,will succeed. Hence a change of diet, drink, and stimulating medicines, isoften advantageous in diseases of debility."|FALSE
15707|"4. Stimulate the organs, whose motions are associated with the torpid partsof the system. The actions of the minute vessels of the various parts ofthe external skin are not only associated with each other, but are stronglyassociated with those of some of the internal membranes, and particularlyof the stomach. Hence when the exertion of the stomach is less thannatural, and indigestion and heartburn succeed, nothing so certainlyremoves these symptoms as the stimulus of a blister on the back. Thecoldness of the extremities, as of the nose, ears, or fingers, are hencethe best indication for the successful application of blisters."|FALSE
15707|"5. Decrease the stimulus for a time. By lessening the quantity of heat fora minute or two by going into the cold bath, a great accumulation ofsensorial power is produced; for not only the minute vessels of the wholeexternal skin for a time become inactive, as appears by their paleness; butthe minute vessels of the lungs lose much of their activity also by concertwith those of the skin, as appears from the difficulty of breathing atfirst going into cold water. On emerging from the bath the sensorial poweris thrown into great exertion by the stimulus of the common degree of thewarmth of the atmosphere, and a great production of animal heat is theconsequence. The longer a person continues in the cold bath the greatermust be the present inertion of a great part of the system, and inconsequence a greater accumulation of sensorial power. Whence M. Pomèrecommends some melancholy patients to be kept from two to six hours inspring-water, and in baths still colder."|FALSE
15707|"6. Decrease the stimulus for a time below the natural, and then increase itabove natural. The effect of this process, improperly used, is seen ingiving much food, or applying much warmth, to those who have beenpreviously exposed to great hunger, or to great cold. The accumulatedsensorial power is thrown into so violent exertion, that inflammations andmortifications supervene, and death closes the catastrophe. In manydiseases this method is the most successful; hence the bark in aguesproduces more certain effect after the previous exhibition of emetics. Indiseases attended with violent pain, opium has double the effect, ifvenesection and a cathartic have been previously used. On this seems tohave been founded the successful practice of Sydenham, who used venesectionand a cathartic in chlorosis before the exhibition of the bark, steel, andopiates."|FALSE
15707|"7. Prevent any unnecessary expenditure of sensorial power. Hence in feverswith debility, a decumbent posture is preferred, with silence, littlelight, and such a quantity of heat as may prevent any chill sensation, orany coldness of the extremities. The pulse of patients in fevers withdebility increases in frequency above ten pulsations in a minute on theirrising out of bed. For the expenditure of sensorial power to preserve anerect posture of the body adds to the general deficiency of it, and thusaffects the circulation."|FALSE
15707|"8. The longer in time and the greater in degree the quiescence or inertionof an organ has been, so that it still retains life or excitability, theless stimulus should at first be applied to it. The quantity of stimulationis a matter of great nicety to determine, where the torpor or quiescence ofthe fibres has been experienced in a great degree, or for a considerabletime, as in cold fits of the ague, in continued fevers with great debility,or in people famished at sea, or perishing with cold. In the two lastcases, very minute quantities of food should be first supplied, and veryfew additional degrees of heat. In the two former cases, but littlestimulus of wine or medicine, above what they had been lately accustomedto, should be exhibited, and this at frequent and stated intervals, so thatthe effect of one quantity may be observed before the exhibition ofanother."|FALSE
15707|"If these circumstances are not attended to, as the sensorial power becomesaccumulated in the quiescent fibres, an inordinate exertion takes place bythe increase of stimulus acting on the accumulated quantity of sensorialpower, and either the paralysis, or death of the contractile fibres ensues,from the total expenditure of the sensorial power in the affected organ,owing to this increase of exertion, like the debility after intoxication.Or, secondly, the violent exertions above mentioned produce painfulsensation, which becomes a new stimulus, and by thus producinginflammation, and increasing the activity of the fibres already too great,sooner exhausts the whole of the sensorial power in the acting organ, andmortification, that is, the death of the part, supervenes."|FALSE
15707|"Hence there have been many instances of people, whose limbs have been longbenumbed by exposure to cold, who have lost them by mortification on theirbeing too hastily brought to the fire; and of others, who were nearlyfamished at sea, who have died soon after having taken not more than anusual meal of food. I have heard of two well-attested instances of patientsin the cold fit of ague, who have died from the exhibition of gin andvinegar, by the inflammation which ensued. And in many fevers attended withdebility, the unlimited use of wine, and the wanton application ofblisters, I believe, has destroyed numbers by the debility consequent totoo great stimulation, that is, by the exhaustion of the sensorial power byits inordinate exertion."|FALSE
15707|"Wherever the least degree of intoxication exists, a proportional debilityis the consequence; but there is a golden rule by which the necessary anduseful quantity of stimulus in fevers with debility may be ascertained.When wine or beer are exhibited either alone or diluted with water, if thepulse becomes slower the stimulus is of a proper quantity; and should berepeated every two or three hours, or when the pulse again becomes quicker."|FALSE
15707|"In the chronical debility brought on by drinking spirituous or fermentedliquors, there is another golden rule by which I have successfully directedthe quantity of spirit which they may safely lessen, for there is no othermeans by which they can recover their health. It should be premised, thatwhere the power of digestion in these patients is totally destroyed, thereis not much reason to expect a return to healthful vigour."|FALSE
15707|"I have directed several of these patients to omit one fourth part of thequantity of vinous spirit they have been lately accustomed to, and if in afortnight their appetite increases, they are advised to omit another fourthpart; but if they perceive that their digestion becomes impaired from thewant of this quantity of spirituous potation, they are advised to continueas they are, and rather bear the ills they have, than risk the encounter ofgreater. At the same time flesh-meat with or without spice is recommended,with Peruvian bark and steel in small quantities between their meals, andhalf a grain of opium or a grain, with five or eight grains of rhubarb atnight."|FALSE

While the power of absorption in the rootsand barks of vegetables is excited into action by the fluids applied totheir mouths like the lacteals and lymphatics of animals."|FALSE
15707|"2. The individuals of the vegetable world may be considered as inferior orless perfect animals; a tree is a congeries of many living buds, and inthis respect resembles the branches of coralline, which are a congeries ofa multitude of animals.

Secondly, the fibres of the barks oftrees are chiefly longitudinal, resembling roots, as is beautifully seen inthose prepared barks, that were lately brought from Otaheita. Thirdly, inhorizontal wounds of the bark of trees, the fibres of the upper lip arealways elongated downwards like roots, but those of the lower lip do notapproach to meet them. Fourthly, if you wrap wet moss round any joint of avine, or cover it with moist earth, roots will shoot out from it. Fifthly,by the inoculation or engrafting of trees many fruits are produced from onestem. Sixthly, a new tree is produced from a branch plucked from an oldone, and set in the ground. Whence it appears that the buds of deciduoustrees are so many annual plants, that the bark is a contexture of the rootsof each individual bud; and that the internal wood is of no other use butto support them in the air, and that thus they resemble the animal world intheir individuality."|FALSE

For this cannot beascribed to irritation, because cold means a defect of the stimulus ofheat; but as the want of accustomed stimuli produces pain, as in coldness,hunger, and thirst of animals, these motions of vegetables in closing uptheir flowers must be ascribed to the disgreeable sensation, and not to theirritation of cold. Others close up their leaves during darkness, which,like the former, cannot be owing to irritation, as the irritating materialis withdrawn."|FALSE

And,lastly, that the anthers and stigmas are real animals, attached indeed totheir parent tree like polypi or coral insects, but capable of spontaneousmotion; that they are affected with the passion of love, and furnished withpowers of reproducing their species, and are fed with honey like the mothsand butterflies, which plunder their nectaries.

Can this be effected by any specific attraction? or, like thediffusion of the odorous particles of flowers, is it left to the currentsof winds, and the accidental miscarriages of it counteracted by thequantity of its production?"|FALSE
15707|"2. This leads us to a curious enquiry, whether vegetables have ideas ofexternal things? As all our ideas are originally received by our senses,the question may be changed to, whether vegetables possess any organs ofsense? Certain it is, that they possess a sense of heat and cold, anotherof moisture and dryness, and another of light and darkness; for they closetheir petals occasionally from the presence of cold, moisture, or darkness.And it has been already shewn, that these actions cannot be performedsimply from irritation, because cold and darkness are negative quantities,and on that account sensation or volition are implied, and in consequence asensorium or union of their nerves. So when we go into the light, wecontract the iris; not from any stimulus of the light on the fine musclesof the iris, but from its motions being associated with the sensation oftoo much light on the retina: which could not take place without asensorium or center of union of the nerves of the iris with those ofvision.

15707|"Besides these organs of sense, which distinguish cold, moisture, anddarkness, the leaves of mimosa, and of dionæa, and of drosera, and thestamens of many flowers, as of the berbery, and the numerous class ofsyngenesia, are sensible to mechanic impact, that is, they possess a senseof touch, as well as a common sensorium; by the medium of which theirmuscles are excited into action. Lastly, in many flowers the anthers, whenmature, approach the stigma, in others the female organ approaches to themale. In a plant of collinsonia, a branch of which is now before me, thetwo yellow stamens are about three eights of an inch high, and diverge fromeach other, at an angle of about fifteen degrees, the purple style is halfan inch high, and in some flowers is now applied to the stamen on the righthand, and in others to that of the left; and will, I suppose, change placeto-morrow in those, where the anthers have not yet effused their powder."|FALSE

Is this curious kind of storge producedby mechanic attraction, or by the sensation of love? The latter opinion issupported by the strongest analogy, because a reproduction of the speciesis the consequence; and then another organ of sense must be wanted todirect these vegetable amourettes to find each other, one probablyanalogous to our sense of smell, which in the animal world directs thenew-born infant to its source of nourishment, and they may thus possess afaculty of perceiving as well as of producing odours."|FALSE

To these must be added theindubitable evidence of their passion of love, and I think we may trulyconclude, that they are furnished with a common sensorium belonging to eachbud and that they must occasionally repeat those perceptions either intheir dreams or waking hours, and consequently possess ideas of so many ofthe properties of the external world, and of their own existence."|FALSE

15707|"I. Philosophers have been much perplexed to understand, in what manner webecome acquainted with the external world; insomuch that Dr. Berkly evendoubted its existence, from having observed (as he thought) that none ofour ideas resemble their correspondent objects. Mr. Hume asserts, that ourbelief depends on the greater distinctness or energy of our ideas fromperception; and Mr. Reid has lately contended, that our belief of externalobjects is an innate principle necessarily joined with our perceptions."|FALSE

15707|"Some philosophers have divided all created beings into material andimmaterial: the former including all that part of being, which obeys themechanic laws of action and reaction, but which can begin no motion ofitself; the other is the cause of all motion, and is either termed thepower of gravity, or of specific attraction, or the spirit of animation.This immaterial agent is supposed to exist in or with matter, but to bequite distinct from it, and to be equally capable of existence, after thematter, which now possesses it, is decomposed."|FALSE
15707|"Nor is this theory ill supported by analogy, since heat, electricity, andmagnetism, can be given to or taken from a piece of iron; and musttherefore exist, whether separated from the metal, or combined with it.From a parity of reasoning, the spirit of animation, would appear to becapable of existing as well separately from the body as with it."|FALSE

15707|"II. 1. _Of the Sense of Touch._"|FALSE
15707|"The first idea we become acquainted with, are those of the sense of touch;for the foetus must experience some varieties of agitation, and exert somemuscular action, in the womb; and may with great probability be supposedthus to gain some ideas of its own figure, of that of the uterus, and ofthe tenacity of the fluid, that surrounds it, (as appears from the factsmentioned in the succeeding Section upon Instinct.)"|FALSE
15707|"Many of the organs of sense are confined to a small part of the body, asthe nostrils, ear, or eye, whilst the sense of touch is diffused over thewhole skin, but exists with a more exquisite degree of delicacy at theextremities of the fingers and thumbs, and in the lips. The sense of touchis thus very commodiously disposed for the purpose of encompassing smallerbodies, and for adapting itself to the inequalities of larger ones. Thefigure of small bodies seems to be learnt by children by their lips as muchas by their fingers; on which account they put every new object to theirmouths, when they are satiated with food, as well as when they are hungry.And puppies seem to learn their ideas of figure principally by the lips intheir mode of play."|FALSE
15707|"We acquire our tangible ideas of objects either by the simple pressure ofthis organ of touch against a solid body, or by moving our organ of touchalong the surface of it. In the former case we learn the length and breadthof the object by the quantity of our organ of touch, that is impressed byit: in the latter case we learn the length and breadth of objects by thecontinuance of their pressure on our moving organ of touch."|FALSE
15707|"It is hence, that we are very slow in acquiring our tangible ideas, andvery slow in recollecting them; for if I now think of the tangible idea ofa cube, that is, if I think of its figure, and of the solidity of everypart of that figure, I must conceive myself as passing my fingers over it,and seem in some measure to feel the idea, as I formerly did theimpression, at the ends of them, and am thus very slow in distinctlyrecollecting it."|FALSE
15707|"When a body compresses any part of our sense of touch, what happens? First,this part of our sensorium undergoes a mechanical compression, which istermed a stimulus; secondly, an idea, or contraction of a part of the organof sense is excited; thirdly, a motion of the central parts, or of thewhole sensorium, which is termed sensation, is produced; and these threeconstitute the perception of solidity."|FALSE
15707|"2. _Of Figure, Motion, Time, Place, Space, Number._"|FALSE
15707|"No one will deny, that the medulla of the brain and nerves has a certainfigure; which, as it is diffused through nearly the whole of the body, musthave nearly the figure of that body. Now it follows, that the spirit ofanimation, or living principle, as it occupies this medulla, and no otherpart, (which is evinced by a great variety of cruel experiments on livinganimals,) it follows, that this spirit of animation has also the samefigure as the medulla above described. I appeal to common sense! the spiritof animation acts, Where does it act? It acts wherever there is the medullaabove mentioned; and that whether the limb is yet joined to a livinganimal, or whether it be recently detached from it; as the heart of a viperor frog will renew its contractions, when pricked with a pin, for manyminutes of time after its exsection from the body.--Does it act any whereelse?--No; then it certainly exists in this part of space, and no whereelse; that is, it hath figure; namely, the figure of the nervous system,which is nearly the figure of the body. When the idea of solidity isexcited, as above explained, a part of the extensive organ of touch iscompressed by some external body, and this part of the sensorium socompressed exactly resembles _in figure_ the figure of the body thatcompressed it. Hence, when we acquire the idea of solidity, we acquire atthe same time the idea of FIGURE; and this idea of figure, or motion of _apart_ of the organ of touch, exactly resembles _in its figure_ the figureof the body that occasions it; and thus exactly acquaints us with thisproperty of the external world."|FALSE
15707|"Now, as the whole universe with all its parts possesses a certain form orfigure, if any part of it moves, that form or figure of the whole isvaried: hence, as MOTION is no other than a perpetual variation of figure,our idea of motion is also a real resemblance of the motion that producedit."|FALSE
15707|"It may be said in objection to this definition of motion, that an ivoryglobe may revolve on its axis, and that here will be a motion withoutchange of figure. But the figure of the particle _x_ on one side of thisglobe is not the _same_ figure as the figure of _y_ on the other side, anymore than the particles themselves are the same, though they are _similar_figures; and hence they cannot change place with each other withoutdisturbing or changing the figure of the whole."|FALSE
15707|"Our idea of TIME is from the same source, but is more abstracted, as itincludes only the comparative velocities of these variations of figure;hence if it be asked, How long was this book in printing? it may beanswered, Whilst the sun was passing through Aries."|FALSE
15707|"Our idea of PLACE includes only the figure of a group of bodies, not thefigures of the bodies themselves. If it be asked where is Nottinghamshire,the answer is, it is surrounded by Derbyshire, Lincolnshire andLeicestershire; hence place is our idea of the figure of one bodysurrounded by the figures of other bodies."|FALSE
15707|"The idea of SPACE is a more abstracted idea of place excluding the group ofbodies."|FALSE
15707|"The idea of NUMBER includes only the particular arrangements, ordistributions of a group of bodies, and is therefore only a more abstractedidea of the parts of the figure of the group of bodies; thus when I sayEngland is divided into forty counties, I only speak of certain divisionsof its figure."|FALSE
15707|"Hence arises the certainty of the mathematical sciences, as they explainthese properties of bodies, which are exactly resembled by our ideas ofthem, whilst we are obliged to collect almost all our other knowledge fromexperiment; that is, by observing the effects exerted by one body uponanother."|FALSE
15707|"3. _Of the Penetrability of Matter._"|FALSE
15707|"The impossibility of two bodies existing together in the same space cannotbe deduced from our idea of solidity, or of figure. As soon as we perceivethe motions of objects that surround us, and learn that we possess a powerto move our own bodies, we experience, that those objects, which excite inus the idea of solidity and of figure, oppose this voluntary movement ofour own organs; as whilst I endeavour to compress between my hands an ivoryball into a spheroid. And we are hence taught by experience, that our ownbody and those, which we touch, cannot exist in the same part of space."|FALSE
15707|"But this by no means demonstrates, that no two bodies can exist together inthe same part of space. Galilæo in the preface to his works seems to be ofopinion, that matter is not impenetrable; Mr. Michel, and Mr. Boscowich inhis Theoria. Philos. Natur. have espoused this hypothesis: which has beenlately published by Dr. Priestley, to whom the world is much indebted forso many important discoveries in science. (Hist. of Light and Colours, p.391.) The uninterrupted passage of light through transparent bodies, of theelectric æther through metallic and aqueous bodies, and of the magneticeffluvia through all bodies, would seem to give some probability to thisopinion. Hence it appears, that beings may exist without possessing theproperty of solidity, as well as they can exist without possessing theproperties, which excite our smell or taste, and can thence occupy spacewithout detruding other bodies from it; but we cannot become acquaintedwith such beings by our sense of touch, any more than we can with odours orflavours without our senses of smell and taste."|FALSE
15707|"But that any being can exist without existing in space, is to my ideasutterly incomprehensible. My appeal is to common sense. _To be_ implies awhen and a where; the one is comparing it with the motions of other beings,and the other with their situations."|FALSE
15707|"If there was but one object, as the whole creation may be considered as oneobject, then I cannot ask where it exists? for there are no other objectsto compare its situation with. Hence if any one denies, that a being existsin space, he denies, that there are any other beings but that one; for toanswer the question, \"Where does it exist?\" is only to mention thesituation of the objects that surround it."|FALSE
15707|"In the same manner if it be asked--\"When does a being exist?\" The answeronly specifies the successive motions either of itself, or of other bodies;hence to say, a body exists not in time, is to say, that there is, or was,no motion in the world."|FALSE
15707|"4. _Of the Spirit of Animation._"|FALSE
15707|"But though there may exist beings in the universe, that have not theproperty of solidity; that is, which can possess any part of space, at thesame time that it is occupied by other bodies; yet there may be otherbeings, that can assume this property of solidity, or disrobe themselves ofit occasionally, as we are taught of spirits, and of angels; and it wouldseem, that THE SPIRIT OF ANIMATION must be endued with this property,otherwise how could it occasionally give motion to the limbs ofanimals?--or be itself stimulated into motion by the obtrusions ofsurrounding bodies, as of light, or odour?"|FALSE
15707|"If the spirit of animation was always necessarily penetrable, it could notinfluence or be influenced by the solidity of common matter; they wouldexist together, but could not detrude each other from the part of space,where they exist; that is, they could not communicate motion to each other._No two things can influence or affect each other, which have not someproperty common to both of them_; for to influence or affect another bodyis to give or communicate some property to it, that it had not before; buthow can one body give that to another, which it does not possessitself?--The words imply, that they must agree in having the power orfaculty of possessing some common property. Thus if one body removesanother from the part of space, that it possesses, it must have the powerof occupying that space itself: and if one body communicates heat or motionto another, it follows, that they have alike the property of possessingheat or motion."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the spirit of animation at the time it communicates or receivesmotion from solid bodies, must itself possess some property of solidity.And in consequence at the time it receives other kinds of motion fromlight, it must possess that property, which light possesses, to communicatethat kind of motion; and for which no language has a name, unless it may betermed Visibility. And at the time it is stimulated into other kinds ofanimal motion by the particles of sapid and odorous bodies affecting thesenses of taste and smell, it must resemble these particles of flavour, andof odour, in possessing some similar or correspondent property; and forwhich language has no name, unless we may use the words Saporosity andOdorosity for those common properties, which are possessed by our organs oftaste and smell, and by the particles of sapid and odorous bodies; as thewords Tangibility and Audibility may express the common property possessedby our organs of touch, and of hearing, and by the solid bodies, or theirvibrations, which affect those organs."|FALSE
15707|"5. Finally, though the figures of bodies are in truth resembled by thefigure of the part of the organ of touch, which is stimulated into motion;and that organ resembles the solid body, which stimulates it, in itsproperty of solidity; and though the sense of hearing resembles thevibrations of external bodies in its capability of being stimulated intomotion by those vibrations; and though our other organs of sense resemblethe bodies, that stimulate them, in their capability of being stimulated bythem; and we hence become acquainted with these properties of the externalworld; yet as we can repeat all these motions of our organs of sense by theefforts of volition, or in consequence of the sensation of pleasure orpain, or by their association with other fibrous motions, as happens in ourreveries or in sleep, there would still appear to be some difficulty indemonstrating the existence of any thing external to us."|FALSE
15707|"In our dreams we cannot determine this circumstance, because our power ofvolition is suspended, and the stimuli of external objects are excluded;but in our waking hours we can compare our ideas belonging to one sensewith those belonging to another, and can thus distinguish the ideasoccasioned by irritation from those excited by sensation, volition, orassociation. Thus if the idea of the sweetness of sugar should be excitedin our dreams, the whiteness and hardness of it occur at the same time byassociation; and we believe a material lump of sugar present before us. Butif, in our waking hours, the idea of the sweetness of sugar occurs to us,the stimuli of surrounding objects, as the edge of the table, on which wepress, or green colour of the grass, on which we tread, prevent the otherideas of the hardness and whiteness of the sugar from being exerted byassociation. Or if they should occur, we voluntarily compare them with theirritative ideas of the table or grass above mentioned, and detect theirfallacy. We can thus distinguish the ideas caused by the stimuli ofexternal objects from those, which are introduced by association,sensation, or volition; and during our waking hours can thus acquire aknowledge of the external world. Which nevertheless we cannot do in ourdreams, because we have neither perceptions of external bodies, nor thepower of volition to enable us to compare them with the ideas ofimagination."|FALSE
15707|"III. _Of Vision._"|FALSE
15707|"Our eyes observe a difference of colour, or of shade, in the prominencesand depressions of objects, and that those shades uniformly vary, when thesense of touch observes any variation. Hence when the retina becomesstimulated by colours or shades of light in a certain form, as in acircular spot; we know by experience, that this is a sign, that a tangiblebody is before us; and that its figure is resembled by the miniature figureof the part of the organ of vision, that is thus stimulated."|FALSE
15707|"Here whilst the stimulated part of the retina resembles exactly the visiblefigure of the whole in miniature, the various kinds of stimuli fromdifferent colours mark the visible figures of the minuter parts; and byhabit we instantly recall the tangible figures."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when a tree is the object of sight, a part of the retina resembling aflat branching figure is stimulated by various shades of colours; but it isby suggestion, that the gibbosity of the tree, and the moss, that fringesits trunk, appear before us. These are ideas of suggestion, which we feelor attend to, associated with the motions of the retina, or irritativeideas, which we do not attend to."|FALSE
15707|"So that though our visible ideas resemble in miniature the outline of thefigure of coloured bodies, in other respects they serve only as a language,which by acquired associations introduce the tangible ideas of bodies.Hence it is, that this sense is so readily deceived by the art of thepainter to our amusement and instruction. The reader will find much verycurious knowledge on this subject in Bishop Berkley's Essay on Vision, awork of great ingenuity."|FALSE
15707|"The immediate object however of the sense of vision is light; this fluid,though its velocity is so great, appears to have no perceptible mechanicalimpulse, as was mentioned in the third Section, but seems to stimulate theretina into animal motion by its transmission through this part of thesensorium: for though the eyes of cats or other animals appear luminous inobscure places; yet it is probable, that none of the light, which falls onthe retina, is reflected from it, but adheres to or enters into combinationwith the choroide coat behind it."|FALSE
15707|"The combination of the particles of light with opake bodies, and thereforewith the choroide coat of the eye, is evinced from the heat, which is givenout, as in other chemical combinations. For the sunbeams communicate noheat in their passage through transparent bodies, with which they do notcombine, as the air continues cool even in the focus of the largestburning-glasses, which in a moment vitrifies a particle of opaque matter."|FALSE
15707|"IV. _Of the Organ of Hearing._"|FALSE
15707|"It is generally believed, that the tympanum of the ear vibratesmechanically, when exposed to audible sounds, like the strings of onemusical instrument, when the same notes are struck upon another. Nor isthis opinion improbable, as the muscles and cartilages of the larynx areemployed in producing variety of tones by mechanical vibration: so themuscles and bones of the ear seem adapted to increase or diminish thetension of the tympanum for the purposes of similar mechanical vibrations."|FALSE
15707|"But it appears from dissection, that the tympanum is not the immediateorgan of hearing, but that like the humours and cornea of the eye, it isonly of use to prepare the object for the immediate organ. For the portiomollis of the auditory nerve is not spread upon the tympanum, but upon thevestibulum, and cochlea, and semicircular canals of the ear; while betweenthe tympanum and the expansion of the auditory nerve the cavity is said byDr. Cotunnus and Dr. Meckel to be filled with water; as they had frequentlyobserved by freezing the heads of dead animals before they dissected them;and water being a more dense fluid than air is much better adapted to thepropagation of vibrations. We may add, that even the external opening ofthe ear is not absolutely necessary for the perception of sound: for somepeople, who from these defects would have been completely deaf, havedistinguished acute or grave sounds by the tremours of a stick held betweentheir teeth propagated along the bones of the head, (Haller. Phys. T. V. p.295)."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, that the immediate organ of hearing is not affected bythe particles of the air themselves, but is stimulated into animal motionby the vibrations of them. And it is probable from the loose bones, whichare found in the heads of some fishes, that the vibrations of water aresensible to the inhabitants of that element by a similar organ."|FALSE
15707|"The motions of the atmosphere, which we become acquainted with by the senseof touch, are combined with its solidity, weight, or vis intertiæ; whereasthose, that are perceived by this organ, depend alone on its elasticity.But though the vibration of the air is the immediate object of the sense ofhearing, yet the ideas, we receive by this sense, like those received fromlight, are only as a language, which by acquired associations acquaints uswith those motions of tangible bodies, which depend on their elasticity;and which we had before learned by our sense of touch."|FALSE
15707|"V. _Of Smell and of Taste._"|FALSE
15707|"The objects of smell are dissolved in the fluid atmosphere, and those oftaste in the saliva, or other aqueous fluid, for the better diffusing themon their respective organs, which seem to be stimulated into animal motionperhaps by the chemical affinities of these particles, which constitute thesapidity and odorosity of bodies with the nerves of sense, which perceivethem."|FALSE
15707|"Mr. Volta has lately observed a curious circumstance relative to our senseof taste. If a bit of clean lead and a bit of clean silver be separatelyapplied to the tongue and palate no taste is perceived; but by applyingthem in contact in respect to the parts out of the mouth, and nearly so inrespect to the parts, which are immediately applied to the tongue andpalate, a saline or acidulous taste is perceived, as of a fluid like astream of electricity passing from one of them to the other. This newapplication of the sense of taste deserves further investigation, as it mayacquaint us with new properties of matter."|FALSE
15707|"From the experiments above mentioned of Galvani, Volta, Fowler, and others,it appears, that a plate of zinc and a plate of silver have greater effectthan lead and silver. If one edge of a plate of silver about the size ofhalf a crown-piece be placed upon the tongue, and one edge of a plate ofzinc about the same size beneath the tongue, and if their opposite edgesare then brought into contact before the point of the tongue, a taste isperceived at the moment of their coming into contact; secondly, if one ofthe above plates be put between the upper lip and the gum of thefore-teeth, and the other be placed under the tongue, and their exterioredges be then brought into contact in a darkish room, a flash of light isperceived in the eyes."|FALSE
15707|"These effects I imagine only shew the sensibility of our nerves of sense tovery small quantities of the electric fluid, as it passes through them; forI suppose these sensations are occasioned by slight electric shocksproduced in the following manner. By the experiments published by Mr.Bennet, with his ingenious doubler of electricity, which is the greatestdiscovery made in that science since the coated jar, and the eduction oflightning from the skies, it appears that zinc was always found minus, andsilver was always found plus, when both of them were in their separatestate. Hence, when they are placed in the manner above described, as soonas their exterior edges come nearly into contact, so near as to have anextremely thin plate of air between them, that plate of air becomes chargedin the same manner as a plate of coated glass; and is at the same instantdischarged through the nerves of taste or of sight, and gives thesensations, as above described, of light or of saporocity; and only shewsthe great sensibility of these organs of sense to the stimulus of theelectric fluid in suddenly passing through them."|FALSE
15707|"VI. _Of the Sense of Heat._"|FALSE
15707|"There are many experiments in chemical writers, that evince the existenceof heat as a fluid element, which covers and pervades all bodies, and isattracted by the solutions of some of them, and is detruded from thecombination of others. Thus from the combinations of metals with acids, andfrom those combinations of animal fluids, which are termed secretions, thisfluid matter of heat is given out amongst the neighbouring bodies; and inthe solutions of salts in water, or of water in air, it is absorbed fromthe bodies, that surround them; whilst in its facility in passing throughmetallic bodies, and its difficulty in pervading resins and glass, itresembles the properties of the electric aura; and is like that excited byfriction, and seems like that to gravitate amongst other bodies in itsuncombined state, and to find its equilibrium."|FALSE
15707|"There is no circumstance of more consequence in the animal economy than adue proportion of this fluid of heat; for the digestion of our nutriment inthe stomach and bowels, and the proper qualities of all our secretedfluids, as they are produced or prepared partly by animal and partly bychemical processes, depend much on the quantity of heat; the excess ofwhich, or its deficiency, alike gives us pain, and induces us to avoid thecircumstances that occasion them. And in this the perception of heatessentially differs from the perceptions of the sense of touch, as wereceive pain from too great pressure of solid bodies, but none from theabsence of it. It is hence probable, that nature has provided us with a setof nerves for the perception of this fluid, which anatomists have not yetattended to."|FALSE
15707|"There may be some difficulty in the proof of this assertion; if we look ata hot fire, we experience no pain of the optic nerve, though the heat alongwith the light must be concentrated upon it. Nor does warm water or warmoil poured into the ear give pain to the organ of hearing; and hence asthese organs of sense do not perceive small excesses or deficiences ofheat; and as heat has no greater analogy to the solidity or to the figuresof bodies, than it has to their colours or vibrations; there seems nosufficient reason for our ascribing the perception of heat and cold to thesense of touch; to which it has generally been attributed, either becauseit is diffused beneath the whole skin like the sense of touch, or owing tothe inaccuracy of our observations, or the defect of our languages."|FALSE
15707|"There is another circumstance would induce us to believe, that theperceptions of heat and cold do not belong to the organ of touch; since theteeth, which are the least adapted for the perceptions of solidity orfigure, are the most sensible to heat or cold; whence we are forewarnedfrom swallowing those materials, whose degree of coldness or of heat wouldinjure our stomachs."|FALSE
15707|"The following is an extract from a letter of Dr. R.W. Darwin, ofShrewsbury, when he was a student at Edinburgh. \"I made an experimentyesterday in our hospital, which much favours your opinion, that thesensation of heat and of touch depend on different sets of nerves. A manwho had lately recovered from a fever, and was still weak, was seized withviolent cramps in his legs and feet; which were removed by opiates, exceptthat one of his feet remained insensible. Mr. Ewart pricked him with a pinin five or six places, and the patient declared he did not feel it in theleast, nor was he sensible of a very smart pinch. I then held a red-hotpoker at some distance, and brought it gradually nearer till it came withinthree inches, when he asserted that he felt it quite distinctly. I supposesome violent irritation on the nerves of touch had caused the cramps, andhad left them paralytic; while the nerves of heat, having suffered noincreased stimulus, retained their irritability.\""|FALSE
15707|"Add to this, that the lungs, though easily stimulated into inflammation,are not sensible to heat. See Class. III. 1. 1. 10."|FALSE
15707|"VII. _Of the Sense of Extension._"|FALSE
15707|"The organ of touch is properly the sense of pressure, but the muscularfibres themselves constitute the organ of sense, that feels extension. Thesense of pressure is always attended with the ideas of the figure andsolidity of the object, neither of which accompany our perception ofextension. The whole set of muscles, whether they are hollow ones, as theheart, arteries, and intestines, or longitudinal ones attached to bones,contract themselves, whenever they are stimulated by forcible elongation;and it is observable, that the white muscles, which constitute the arterialsystem, seem to be excited into contraction from no other kinds ofstimulus, according to the experiments of Haller. And hence the violentpain in some inflammations, as in the paronychia, obtains immediate reliefby cutting the membrane, that was stretched by the tumour of the subjacentparts."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the whole muscular system may be considered as one organ of sense,and the various attitudes of the body, as ideas belonging to this organ, ofmany of which we are hourly conscious, while many others, like theirritative ideas of the other senses, are performed without our attention."|FALSE
15707|"When the muscles of the heart cease to act, the refluent blood againdistends or elongates them; and thus irritated they contract as before. Thesame happens to the arterial system, and I suppose to the capillaries,intestines, and various glands of the body."|FALSE
15707|"When the quantity of urine, or of excrement, distends the bladder, orrectum, those parts contract, and exclude their contents, and many othermuscles by association act along with them; but if these evacuations arenot soon complied with, pain is produced by a little further extension ofthe muscular fibres: a similar pain is caused in the muscles, when a limbis much extended for the reduction of dislocated bones; and in thepunishment of the rack: and in the painful cramps of the calf of the leg,or of other muscles, for a greater degree of contraction of a muscle, thanthe movement of the two bones, to which its ends are affixed, will admitof, must give similar pain to that, which is produced by extending itbeyond its due length. And the pain from punctures or incisions arises fromthe distention of the fibres, as the knife passes through them; for itnearly ceases as soon as the division is completed."|FALSE
15707|"All these motions of the muscles, that are thus naturally excited by thestimulus of distending bodies, are also liable to be called into strongaction by their catenation, with the irritations or sensations produced bythe momentum of the progressive particles of blood in the arteries, as ininflammatory fevers, or by acrid substances on other sensible organs, as inthe strangury, or tenesmus, or cholera."|FALSE
15707|"We shall conclude this account of the sense of extension by observing, thatthe want of its object is attended with a disagreeable sensation, as wellas the excess of it. In those hollow muscles, which have been accustomed toit, this disagreeable sensation is called faintness, emptiness, andsinking; and, when it arises to a certain degree, is attended with syncope,or a total quiescence of all motions, but the internal irritative ones, ashappens from sudden loss of blood, or in the operation of tapping in thedropsy."|FALSE
15707|"VIII. _Of the Appetites of Hunger, Thirst, Heat, Extension, the want offresh Air, animal Love, and the Suckling of Children._"|FALSE
15707|"Hunger is most probably perceived by those numerous ramifications of nervesthat are seen about the upper opening of the stomach; and thirst by thenerves about the fauces, and the top of the gula. The ideas of these sensesare few in the generality of mankind, but are more numerous in those, whoby disease, or indulgence, desire particular kinds of foods or liquids."|FALSE
15707|"A sense of heat has already been spoken of, which may with propriety becalled an appetite, as we painfully desire it, when it is deficient inquantity."|FALSE
15707|"The sense of extension may be ranked amongst these appetites, since thedeficiency of its object gives disagreeable sensation; when this happens inthe arterial system, it is called faintness, and seems to bear some analogyto hunger and to cold; which like it are attended with emptiness of a partof the vascular system."|FALSE
15707|"The sense of want of fresh air has not been attended to, but is as distinctas the others, and the first perhaps that we experience after our nativity;from the want of the object of this sense many diseases are produced, asthe jail-fever, plague, and other epidemic maladies. Animal love is anotherappetite, which occurs later in life, and the females of lactiferousanimals have another natural inlet of pleasure or pain from the sucklingtheir offspring. The want of which either owing to the death of theirprogeny, or to the fashion of their country, has been fatal to many of thesex. The males have also pectoral glands, which are frequently turgid witha thin milk at their nativity, and are furnished with nipples, which erecton titillation like those of the female; but which seem now to be of nofurther use, owing perhaps to some change which these animals haveundergone in the gradual progression of the formation of the earth, and ofall that it inhabit."|FALSE
15707|"These seven last mentioned senses may properly be termed appetites, as theydiffer from those of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell, in thisrespect; that they are affected with pain as well by the defect of theirobjects as by the excess of them, which is not so in the latter. Thus coldand hunger give us pain, as well as an excess of heat or satiety; but it isnot so with darkness and silence."|FALSE
15707|"IX. Before we conclude this Section on the organs of sense, we mustobserve, that, as far as we know, there are many more senses, than havebeen here mentioned, as every gland seems to be influenced to separate fromthe blood, or to absorb from the cavities of the body, or from theatmosphere, its appropriated fluid, by the stimulus of that fluid on theliving gland; and not by mechanical capillary absorption, nor by chemicalaffinity. Hence it appears, that each of these glands must have a peculiarorgan to perceive these irritations, but as these irritations are notsucceeded by sensation, they have not acquired the names of senses."|FALSE
15707|"However when these glands are excited into motions stronger than usual,either by the acrimony of their fluids, or by their own irritability beingmuch increased, then the sensation of pain is produced in them as in allthe other senses of the body; and these pains are all of different kinds,and hence the glands at this time really become each a different organ ofsense, though these different kinds of pain have acquired no names."|FALSE
15707|"Thus a great excess of light does not give the idea of light but of pain;as in forcibly opening the eye when it is much inflamed. The great excessof pressure or distention, as when the point of a pin is pressed upon ourskin, produces pain, (and when this pain of the sense of distention isslighter, it is termed itching, or tickling), without any idea of solidityor of figure: an excess of heat produces smarting, of cold another kind ofpain; it is probable by this sense of heat the pain produced by causticbodies is perceived, and of electricity, as all these are fluids, thatpermeate, distend, or decompose the parts that feel them."|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. As the constituent elements of the material world are onlyperceptible to our organs of sense in a state of combination; it follows,that the ideas or sensual motions excited by them, are never receivedsingly, but ever with a greater or less degree of combination. So thecolours of bodies or their hardnesses occur with their figures: every smelland taste has its degree of pungency as well as its peculiar flavour: andeach note in music is combined with the tone of some instrument. It appearsfrom hence, that we can be sensible of a number of ideas at the same time,such as the whiteness, hardness, and coldness, of a snow-ball, and canexperience at the same time many irritative ideas of surrounding bodies,which we do not attend to, as mentioned in Section VII. 3. 2. But thoseideas which belong to the same sense, seem to be more easily combined intosynchronous tribes, than those which were not received by the same sense,as we can more easily think of the whiteness and figure of a lump of sugarat the same time, than the whiteness and sweetness of it."|FALSE
15707|"2. As these ideas, or sensual motions, are thus excited with greater orless degrees of combination; so we have a power, when we repeat them eitherby our volition or sensation, to increase or diminish this degree ofcombination, that is, to form compounded ideas from those, which were moresimple; and abstract ones from those, which were more complex, when theywere first excited; that is, we can repeat a part or the whole of thosesensual motions, which did constitute our ideas of perception; and therepetition of which now constitutes our ideas of recollection, or ofimagination."|FALSE
15707|"3. Those ideas, which we repeat without change of the quantity of thatcombination, with which we first received them, are called complex ideas,as when you recollect Westminster Abbey, or the planet Saturn: but it mustbe observed, that these complex ideas, thus re-excited by volition,sensation, or association, are seldom perfect copies of their correspondentperceptions, except in our dreams, where other external objects do notdetract our attention."|FALSE
15707|"4. Those ideas, which are more complex than the natural objects that firstexcited them, have been called compounded ideas, as when we think of asphinx, or griffin."|FALSE
15707|"5. And those that are less complex than the correspondent natural objects,have been termed abstracted ideas: thus sweetness, and whiteness, andsolidity, are received at the same time from a lump of sugar, yet I canrecollect any of these qualities without thinking of the others, that wereexcited along with them."|FALSE
15707|"When ideas are so far abstracted as in the above example, they have beentermed simple by the writers of metaphysics, and seem indeed to be morecomplete repetitions of the ideas or sensual motions, originally excited byexternal objects."|FALSE
15707|"Other classes of these ideas, where the abstraction has not been so great,have been termed, by Mr. Locke, modes, substances, and relations, but theyseem only to differ in their degree of abstraction from the complex ideasthat were at first excited; for as these complex or natural ideas arethemselves imperfect copies of their correspondent perceptions, so theseabstract or general ideas are only still more imperfect copies of the sameperceptions. Thus when I have seen an object but once, as a rhinoceros, myabstract idea of this animal is the same as my complex one. I may thinkmore or less distinctly of a rhinoceros, but it is the very rhinoceros thatI saw, or some part or property of him, which recurs to my mind."|FALSE
15707|"But when any class of complex objects becomes the subject of conversation,of which I have seen many individuals, as a castle or an army, someproperty or circumstance belonging to it is peculiarly alluded to; and thenI feel in my own mind, that my abstract idea of this complex object is onlyan idea of that part, property, or attitude of it, that employs the presentconversation, and varies with every sentence that is spoken concerning it.So if any one should say, \"one may sit upon a horse safer than on a camel,\"my abstract idea of the two animals includes only an outline of the levelback of the one, and the gibbosity on the back of the other. What noise isthat in the street?--Some horses trotting over the pavement. Here my ideaof the horses includes principally the shape and motion of their legs. Soalso the abstract ideas of goodness and courage are still more imperfectrepresentations of the objects they were received from; for here weabstract the material parts, and recollect only the qualities."|FALSE
15707|"Thus we abstract so much from some of our complex ideas, that at length itbecomes difficult to determine of what perception they partake; and in manyinstances our idea seems to be no other than of the sound or letters of theword, that stands for the collective tribe, of which we are said to have anabstracted idea, as noun, verb, chimæra, apparition."|FALSE
15707|"6. Ideas have been divided into those of perception and those ofreflection, but as whatever is perceived must be external to the organ thatperceives it, all our ideas must originally be ideas of perception."|FALSE

Others have divided our ideas into those of memory, and those ofimagination; they have said that a recollection of ideas in the order theywere received constitutes memory, and without that order imagination; butall the ideas of imagination, excepting the few that are termed simpleideas, are parts of trains or tribes in the order they were received; as ifI think of a sphinx, or a griffin, the fair face, bosom, wings, claws,tail, are all complex ideas in the order they were received: and it behovesthe writers, who adhere to this definition, to determine, how small thetrains must be, that shall be called imagination; and how great those, thatshall be called memory."|FALSE
15707|"Others have thought that the ideas of memory have a greater vivacity thanthose of imagination: but the ideas of a person in sleep, or in a wakingreverie, where the trains connected with sensation are uninterrupted, aremore vivid and distinct than those of memory, so that they cannot bedistinguished by this criterion."|FALSE
15707|"The very ingenious author of the Elements of Criticism has described whathe conceives to be a species of memory, and calls it ideal presence; butthe instances he produces are the reveries of sensation, and are thereforein truth connections of the imagination, though they are recalled in theorder they were received."|FALSE

Lastly, the method already explained of classing ideas into thoseexcited by irritation, sensation, volition, or association, we hope will befound more convenient both for explaining the operations of the mind, andfor comparing them with those of the body; and for the illustration and thecure of the diseases of both, and which we shall here recapitulate."|FALSE

Irritative ideas are those, which are preceded by irritation, which isexcited by objects external to the organs of sense: as the idea of thattree, which either I attend to, or which I shun in walking near it withoutattention.

15707|"3. Invention is an operation of the sensorium, by which we voluntarilycontinue to excite one train of ideas, suppose the design of raising waterby a machine; and at the same time attend to all other ideas, which areconnected with this by every kind of catenation; and combine or separatethem voluntarily for the purpose of obtaining some end."|FALSE
15707|"For we can create nothing new, we can only combine or separate the ideas,which we have already received by our perceptions: thus if I wish torepresent a monster, I call to my mind the ideas of every thingdisagreeable and horrible, and combine the nastiness and gluttony of a hog,the stupidity and obstinacy of an ass, with the fur and awkwardness of abear, and call the new combination Caliban. Yet such a monster may exist innature, as all his attributes are parts of nature. So when I wish torepresent every thing, that is excellent, and amiable; when I combinebenevolence with cheerfulness, wisdom, knowledge, taste, wit, beauty ofperson, and elegance of manners, and associate them in one lady as apattern to the world, it is called invention; yet such a person mayexist,--such a person does exist!--It is ---- ----, who is as much amonster as Caliban."|FALSE

In respect to consciousness, we are only conscious of our existence,when we think about it; as we only perceive the lapse of time, when weattend to it; when we are busied about other objects, neither the lapse oftime nor the consciousness of our own existence can occupy our attention.Hence, when we think of our own existence, we only excite abstracted orreflex ideas (as they are termed), of our principal pleasures or pains, ofour desires or aversions, or of the figure, solidity, colour, or otherproperties of our bodies, and call that act of the sensorium aconsciousness of our existence. Some philosopher, I believe it is DesCartes, has said, \"I think, therefore I exist.\" But this is not rightreasoning, because thinking is a mode of existence; and it is thence onlysaying, \"I exist, therefore I exist.\" For there are three modes ofexistence, or in the language of grammarians three kinds of verbs. First,simply I am, or exist. Secondly, I am acting, or exist in a state ofactivity, as I move. Thirdly, I am suffering, or exist in a state of beingacted upon, as I am moved.

Form de Poulet. ii. p. 129). Puppies before the membranes arebroken, that involve them, are seen to move themselves, to put out theirtongues, and to open and shut their mouths, (Harvey, Gipson, Riolan,Haller). And calves lick themselves and swallow many of their hairs beforetheir nativity: which however puppies do not, (Swammerden, p. 319. FlemyngPhil. Trans. Ann. 1755. 42). And towards the end of gestation, the foetusof all animals are proved to drink part of the liquid in which they swim,(Haller. Physiol. T. 8. 204). The white of egg is found in the mouth andgizzard of the chick, and is nearly or quite consumed before it is hatched,(Harvie de Generat. 58). And the liquor amnii is found in the mouth andstomach of the human foetus, and of calves; and how else should thatexcrement be produced in the intestines of all animals, which is voided ingreat quantity soon after their birth; (Gipson, Med. Essays, Edinb. V. i.13. Halleri Physiolog. T. 3. p. 318. and T. 8). In the stomach of a calfthe quantity of this liquid amounted to about three pints, and the hairsamongst it were of the same colour with those on its skin, (Blasii Anat.Animal, p.m. 122).

It has been deemed a surprising instance of instinct, that calves andchickens should be able to walk by a few efforts almost immediately aftertheir nativity: whilst the human infant in those countries where he is notincumbered with clothes, as in India, is five or six months, and in ourclimate almost a twelvemonth, before he can safely stand upon his feet."|FALSE

Thus the colt, and the lamb, are much moreperfect animals than the blind puppy, and the naked rabbit; and the chickof the pheasant, and the partridge, has more perfect plumage, and moreperfect eyes, as well as greater aptitude to locomotion, than the callownestlings of the dove, and of the wren. The parents of the former only findit necessary to shew them their food, and to teach them to take it up;whilst those of the latter are obliged for many days to obtrude it intotheir gaping mouths."|FALSE

From the facts mentioned in No. 2. of this Section, it is evinced thatthe foetus learns to swallow before its nativity; for it is seen to openits mouth, and its stomach is found filled with the liquid that surroundsit. It opens its mouth, either instigated by hunger, or by the irksomenessof a continued attitude of the muscles of its face; the liquor amnii, inwhich it swims, is agreeable to its palate, as it consists of a nourishingmaterial, (Haller Phys. T. 8. p. 204). It is tempted to experience itstaste further in the mouth, and by a few efforts learns to swallow, in thesame manner as we learn all other animal actions, which are attended withconsciousness, _by the repeated efforts of our muscles under the conduct ofour sensations or volitions_."|FALSE
15707|"The inspiration of air into the lungs is so totally different from that ofswallowing a fluid in which we are immersed, that it cannot be acquiredbefore our nativity. But at this time, when the circulation of the blood isno longer continued through the placenta, that suffocating sensation, whichwe feel about the precordia, when we are in want of fresh air, disagreeablyaffects the infant: and all the muscles of the body are excited into actionto relieve this oppression; those of the breast, ribs, and diaphragm arefound to answer this purpose, and thus respiration is discovered, and iscontinued throughout our lives, as often as the oppression begins to recur.Many infants, both of the human creature, and of quadrupeds, struggle for aminute after they are born before they begin to breathe, (Haller Phys. T.8. p. 400. ib pt. 2. p. 1). Mr. Buffon thinks the action of the dry airupon the nerves of smell of new-born animals, by producing an endeavour tosneeze, may contribute to induce this first inspiration, and that therarefaction of the air by the warmth of the lungs contributes to induceexpiration, (Hist. Nat. Tom. 4. p. 174). Which latter it may effect byproducing a disagreeable sensation by its delay, and a consequent effort torelieve it. Many children sneeze before they respire, but not all, as faras I have observed, or can learn from others."|FALSE
15707|"At length, by the direction of its sense of smell, or by the officious careof its mother, the young animal approaches the odoriferous rill of itsfuture nourishment, already experienced to swallow. But in the act ofswallowing, it is necessary nearly to close the mouth, whether the creaturebe immersed in the fluid it is about to drink, or not: hence, when thechild first attempts to suck, it does not slightly compress the nipplebetween its lips, and suck as an adult person would do, by absorbing themilk; but it takes the whole nipple into its mouth for this purpose,compresses it between its gums, and thus repeatedly chewing (as it were)the nipple, presses out the milk, exactly in the same manner as it is drawnfrom the teats of cows by the hands of the milkmaid. The celebrated Harveyobserves, that the foetus in the womb must have sucked in a part of itsnourishment, because it knows how to suck the minute it is born, as any onemay experience by putting a finger between its lips, and because in a fewdays it forgets this art of sucking, and cannot without some difficultyagain acquire it, (Exercit. de Gener. Anim. 48). The same observation ismade by Hippocrates."|FALSE
15707|"A little further experience teaches the young animal to suck by absorption,as well as by compression; that is, to open the chest as in the beginningof respiration, and thus to rarefy the air in the mouth, that the pressureof the denser external atmosphere may contribute to force out the milk."|FALSE
15707|"The chick yet in the shell has learnt to drink by swallowing a part of thewhite of the egg for its food; but not having experienced how to take upand swallow solid seeds, or grains, is either taught by the felicitousindustry of its mother; or by many repeated attempts is enabled at lengthto distinguish and to swallow this kind of nutriment."|FALSE
15707|"And puppies, though they know how to suck like other animals from theirprevious experience in swallowing, and in respiration; yet are they long inacquiring the art of lapping with their tongues, which from the flaccidityof their cheeks, and length of their mouths, is afterwards a moreconvenient way for them to take in water."|FALSE
15707|"V. The senses of smell and taste in many other animals greatly excel thoseof mankind, for in civilized society, as our victuals are generallyprepared by others, and are adulterated with salt, spice, oil, andempyreuma, we do not hesitate about eating whatever is set before us, andneglect to cultivate these senses: whereas other animals try every morselby the smell, before they take it into their mouths, and by the tastebefore they swallow it: and are led not only each to his proper nourishmentby this organ of sense, but it also at a maturer age directs them in thegratification of their appetite of love. Which may be further understood byconsidering the sympathies of these parts described in Class IV. 2. 1. 7.While the human animal is directed to the object of his love by his senseof beauty, as mentioned in No. VI. of this Section.

The two following instances of thesagacity of these animals may entertain the reader, as they were told me bysome gentlemen of distinct observation, and undoubted veracity, who hadbeen much conversant with our eastern settlements. First, the elephantsthat are used to carry the baggage of our armies, are put each under thecare of one of the natives of Indostan, and whilst himself and his wife gointo the woods to collect leaves and branches of trees for his food, theyfix him to the ground by a length of chain, and frequently leave a childyet unable to walk, under his protection: and the intelligent animal notonly defends it, but as it creeps about, when it arrives near the extremityof his chain, he wraps his trunk gently round its body, and brings it againinto the centre of his circle. Secondly, the traitor elephants are taughtto walk on a narrow path between two pit-falls, which are covered withturf, and then to go into the woods, and to seduce the wild elephants tocome that way, who fall into these wells, whilst he passes safe betweenthem: and it is universally observed, that those wild elephants that escapethe snare, pursue the traitor with the utmost vehemence, and if they canovertake him, which sometimes happens, they always beat him to death."|FALSE

(De l'Esprit. T. 1. p.)

Thus the appearance of a cheerful countenancegives us pleasure, and of a melancholy one makes us sorrowful. Yawning andsometimes vomiting are thus propagated by sympathy, and some people ofdelicate fibres, at the presence of a spectacle of misery, have felt painin the same parts of their own bodies, that were diseased or mangled in theother.

Bythis contrivance the organ is rendered more fit for perceiving such odours,and is preserved from being injured by those that are more strong orcorrosive. Many other receptacles of peculiar fluids disgorge theircontents, when the ends of their ducts are stimulated; as the gall bladder,when the contents of the duodenum stimulate the extremity of the commonbile duct: and the salivary glands, when the termination of their ducts inthe mouth are excited by the stimulus of the food we masticate.

Any one may observe this, when very young infants are aboutto suck; for at those early periods of life, the sensation affects theorgan of smell, much more powerfully, than after the repeated habits ofsmelling has inured it to odours of common strength: and in our adultyears, the stronger smells, though they are at the same time agreeable tous, as of volatile spirits, continue to produce an increased secretion oftears."|FALSE

With this instrument, I conceive, by a littleexperience, they can at once determine, whether any aperture amongst hedgesor shrubs, in which animals of this genus live in their wild state, islarge enough to admit their bodies; which to them is a matter of thegreatest consequence, whether pursuing or pursued.

In about a week afterI first saw the young ones, one of them was missing, and I rather suspectedmy plough-boys having taken it; though it might possibly have been taken bya hawk, some time when the old one was seeking food. I never found her offher nest but once, and that was the last time I saw the remaining youngone, when it was almost full feathered. I then went from home for two orthree days, and, when I returned, the young one was gone, which I take forgranted had flown.

From some observations of Mr. Wildman, and of other people ofveracity, it appears, that during the severe part of the winter season forweeks together the bees are quite benumbed and torpid from the cold, and donot consume any of their provision.

15707|"I. 1. To investigate with precision the catenations of animal motions, itwould be well to attend to the manner of their production; but we cannotbegin this disquisition early enough for this purpose, as the catenationsof motion seem to begin with life, and are only extinguishable with it; Wehave spoken of the power of irritation, of sensation, of volition, and ofassociation, as preceding the fibrous motions; we now step forwards, andconsider, that conversely they are in their turn preceded by those motions;and that all the successive trains or circles of our actions are composedof this twofold concatenation. Those we shall call trains of action, whichcontinue to proceed without any stated repetitions; and those circles ofaction, when the parts of them return at certain periods, though thetrains, of which they consist, are not exactly similar. The reading an epicpoem is a train of actions; the reading a song with a chorus at equaldistances in the measure constitutes so many circles of action."|FALSE

15707|"Other catenations of motions are gradually acquired by frequent voluntaryrepetitions; as when we deliberately learn to march, read, fence, or anymechanic art, the motions of many of our muscles become gradually linkedtogether in trains, tribes, or circles of action.

Thus when a child revolves someminute on one foot, the spectra of the ambient objects appear to circulateround him some time after he falls upon the ground. Thus the palpitation ofthe heart continues some time after the object of fear, which occasionedit, is removed. The blush of shame, which is an excess of sensation, andthe glow of anger, which is an excess of volition, continue some time,though the affected person finds, that those emotions were caused bymistaken facts, and endeavours to extinguish their appearance.

The last link of thebroken chain of actions becomes connected with the new motion which hasbroken it, or with that which was nearest the link omitted; and these newcatenations proceed instead of the old ones. Hence the periodic returns ofague-fits, and the chimeras of our dreams."|FALSE
15707|"10. If a train of actions is dissevered, much effort of volition orsensation will prevent its being restored. Thus in the common impediment ofspeech, when the association of the motions of the muscles of enunciationwith the idea of the word to be spoken is disordered, the great voluntaryefforts, which distort the countenance, prevent the rejoining of the brokenassociations. See No. II. 10. of this Section. It is thus likewiseobservable in some inflammations of the bowels, the too strong efforts madeby the muscles to carry forwards the offending material fixes it morefirmly in its place, and prevents the cure. So in endeavouring to recal toour memory some particular word of a sentence, if we exert ourselves toostrongly about it, we are less likely to regain it."|FALSE
15707|"11. Catenated trains or tribes of action are easier dissevered thancatenated circles of action. Hence in epileptic fits the synchronousconnected tribes of action, which keep the body erect, are dissevered, butthe circle of vital motions continues undisturbed."|FALSE
15707|"12. Sleep destroys the power of volition, and precludes the stimuli ofexternal objects, and thence dissevers the trains, of which these are apart; which confirms the other catenations, as those of the vital motions,secretions, and absorptions; and produces the new trains of ideas, whichconstitute our dreams."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. All the preceding circumstances of the catenations of animal motionswill be more clearly understood by the following example of a personlearning music; and when we recollect the variety of mechanic arts, whichare performed by associated trains of muscular actions catenated with theeffects they produce, as in knitting, netting, weaving; and the greatervariety of associated trains of ideas caused or catenated by volitions orsensations, as in our hourly modes of reasoning, or imagining, orrecollecting, we shall gain some idea of the innumerable catenated trainsand circles of action, which form the tenor of our lives, and which began,and will only cease entirely with them."|FALSE
15707|"2. When a young lady begins to learn music, she voluntarily applies herselfto the characters of her music-book, and by many repetitions endeavours tocatenate them with the proportions of sound, of which they are symbols. Theideas excited by the musical characters are slowly connected with the keysof the harpsichord, and much effort is necessary to produce every note withthe proper finger, and in its due place and time; till at length a train ofvoluntary exertions becomes catenated with certain irritations. As thevarious notes by frequent repetitions become connected in the order, inwhich they are produced, a new catenation of sensitive exertions becomesmixed with the voluntary ones above described; and not only the musicalsymbols of crotchets and quavers, but the auditory notes and tones at thesame time, become so many successive or synchronous links in this circle ofcatenated actions."|FALSE
15707|"At length the motions of her fingers become catenated with the musicalcharacters; and these no sooner strike the eye, than the finger pressesdown the key without any voluntary attention between them; the activity ofthe hand being connected with the irritation of the figure or place of themusical symbol on the retina; till at length by frequent repetitions of thesame tune the movements of her fingers in playing, and the muscles of thelarynx in singing, become associated with each other, and form part ofthose intricate trains and circles of catenated motions, according with thesecond article of the preceding propositions in No. 1. of this Section."|FALSE

A very remarkable thing attends this breach of catenation, if theperformer has forgotten some word of her song, the more energy of mind sheuses about it, the more distant is she from regaining it; and artfullyemploys her mind in part on some other object, or endeavours to dull itsperceptions, continuing to repeat, as it were inconsciously, the formerpart of the song, that she remembers, in hopes to regain the lostconnexion."|FALSE
15707|"For if the activity of the mind itself be more energetic, or takes itsattention more, than the connecting word, which is wanted; it will notperceive the slighter link of this lost word; as who listens to a feeblesound, must be very silent and motionless; so that in this case the veryvigour of the mind itself seems to prevent it from regaining the lostcatenation, as well as the too great exertion in endeavouring to regain it,according to the tenth preceding article."|FALSE
15707|"We frequently experience, when we are doubtful about the spelling of aword, that the greater voluntary exertion we use, that is the moreintensely we think about it, the further are we from regaining the lostassociation between the letters of it, but which readily recurs when wehave become careless about it. In the same manner, after having for an hourlaboured to recollect the name of some absent person, it shall seem,particularly after sleep, to come into the mind as it were spontaneously;that is the word we are in search of, was joined to the preceding one byassociation; this association being dissevered, we endeavour to recover itby volition; this very action of the mind strikes our attention more, thanthe faint link of association, and we find it impossible by this means toretrieve the lost word. After sleep, when volition is entirely suspended,the mind becomes capable of perceiving the fainter link of association, andthe word is regained."|FALSE

Hence when the mind of the stammerer isvehemently employed on some idea of ambition of shining, or fear of notsucceeding, the associations of the motions of the muscles of articulationwith each other become dissevered by this greater exertion, and heendeavours in vain by voluntary efforts to rejoin the broken association.For this purpose he continues to repeat the first syllable, which iscausable by volition, and strives in vain, by various distortions ofcountenance, to produce the next links, which are subject to association.See Class IV. 3. 1. 1."|FALSE
15707|"11. After our accomplished musician has acquired great variety of tunes andsongs, so that some of them begin to cease to be easily recollected, shefinds progressive trains of musical notes more frequently forgotten, thanthose which are composed of reiterated circles, according with the eleventhpreceding article."|FALSE
15707|"12. To finish our example with the preceding articles we must at lengthsuppose, that our fair performer falls asleep over her harpsichord; andthus by the suspension of volition, and the exclusion of external stimuli,she dissevers the trains and circles of her musical exertions."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. Many of these circumstances of catenations of motions receive aneasy explanation from the four following consequences to the seventh law ofanimal causation in Sect. IV. These are, first, that those successions orcombinations of animal motions, whether they were united by causation,association, or catenation, which have been most frequently repeated,acquire the strongest connection. Secondly, that of these, those, whichhave been less frequently mixed with other trains or tribes of motion, havethe strongest connection. Thirdly, that of these, those, which were firstformed, have the strongest connection. Fourthly, that if an animal motionbe excited by more than one causation, association, or catenation, at thesame time, it will be performed with greater energy."|FALSE
15707|"2. Hence also we understand, why the catenations of irritative motions aremore strongly connected than those of the other classes, where the quantityof unmixed repetition has been equal; because they were first formed. Suchare those of the secerning and absorbent systems of vessels, where theaction of the gland produces a fluid, which stimulates the mouths of itscorrespondent absorbents. The associated motions seem to be the next moststrongly united, from their frequent repetition; and where both thesecircumstances unite, as in the vital motions, their catenations areindissoluble but by the destruction of the animal."|FALSE
15707|"3. Where a new link has been introduced into a circle of actions by someaccidental defect of stimulus; if that defect of stimulus be repeated atthe same part of the circle a second or a third time, the defective motionsthus produced, both by the repeated defect of stimulus and by theircatenation with the parts of the circle of actions, will be performed withless and less energy. Thus if any person is exposed to cold at a certainhour to-day, so long as to render some part of the system for a timetorpid; and is again exposed to it at the same hour to-morrow, and the nextday; he will be more and more affected by it, till at length a cold fit offever is completely formed, as happens at the beginning of many of thosefevers, which are called nervous or low fevers. Where the patient hasslight periodical shiverings and paleness for many days before the febrileparoxysm is completely formed."|FALSE
15707|"4. On the contrary, if the exposure to cold be for so short a time, as notto induce any considerable degree of torpor or quiescence, and is repeateddaily as above mentioned, it loses its effect more and more at everyrepetition, till the constitution can bear it without inconvenience, orindeed without being conscious of it. As in walking into the cold air infrosty weather. The same rule is applicable to increased stimulus, as ofheat, or of vinous spirit, within certain limits, as is applied in the twolast paragraphs to Deficient Stimulus; as is further explained in Sect.XXXVI. on the Periods of Diseases."|FALSE
15707|"5. Where irritation coincides with sensation to produce the samecatenations of motion, as in inflammatory fevers, they are excited withstill greater energy than by the irritation alone. So when children expectto be tickled in play, by a feather lightly passed over the lips, or bygently vellicating the soles of their feet, laughter is most vehementlyexcited; though they can stimulate these parts with their own fingersunmoved. Here the pleasureable idea of playfulness coincides with thevellication; and there is no voluntary exertion used to diminish thesensation, as there would be, if a child should endeavour to ticklehimself. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"6. And lastly, the motions excited by the junction of voluntary exertionwith irritation are performed with more energy, than those by irritationsingly; as when we listen to small noises, as to the ticking of a watch inthe night, we perceive the most weak sounds, that are at other timesunheeded. So when we attend to the irritative ideas of sound in our ears,which are generally not attended to, we can hear them; and can see thespectra of objects, which remain in the eye, whenever we please to exertour voluntary power in aid of those weak actions of the retina, or of theauditory nerve."|FALSE
15707|"7. The temporary catenations of ideas, which are caused by the sensationsof pleasure or pain, are easily dissevered either by irritations, as when asudden noise disturbs a day-dream; or by the power of volition, as when weawake from sleep. Hence in our waking hours, whenever an idea occurs, whichis incongruous to our former experience, we instantly dissever the train ofimagination by the power of volition, and compare the incongruous idea withour previous knowledge of nature, and reject it. This operation of the mindhas not yet acquired a specific name, though it is exerted every minute ofour waking hours; unless it may be termed INTUITIVE ANALOGY. It is an actof reasoning of which we are unconscious except from its effects inpreserving the congruity of our ideas, and bears the same relation to thesensorial power of volition, that irritative ideas, of which we areinconscious except by their effects, do to the sensorial power ofirritation; as the former is produced by volition without our attention toit, and the latter by irritation without our attention to them."|FALSE
15707|"If on the other hand a train of imagination or of voluntary ideas areexcited with great energy, and passing on with great vivacity, and becomedissevered by some violent stimulus, as the discharge of a pistol nearone's ear, another circumstance takes place, which is termed SURPRISE;which by exciting violent irritation, and violent sensation, employs for atime the whole sensorial energy, and thus dissevers the passing trains ofideas, before the power of volition has time to compare them with the usualphenomena of nature. In this case fear is generally the companion ofsurprise, and adds to our embarrassment, as every one experiences in somedegree when he hears a noise in the dark, which he cannot instantly accountfor. This catenation of fear with surprise is owing to our perpetualexperience of injuries from external bodies in motion, unless we are uponour guard against them. See Sect. XVIII. 17. XIX. 2."|FALSE

There are four situations of our system, which in their moderate degreesare not usually termed diseases, and yet abound with many very curious andinstructive phenomena; these are sleep, reverie, vertigo, drunkenness.These we shall previously consider, before we step forwards to develop thecauses and cures of diseases with the modes of the operation of medicines."|FALSE
15707|"As all those trains and tribes of animal motion, which are subjected tovolition, were the last that were caused, their connection is weaker thanthat of the other classes; and there is a peculiar circumstance attendingthis causation, which is, that it is entirely suspended during sleep;whilst the other classes of motion, which are more immediately necessary tolife, as those caused by internal stimuli, for instance the pulsations ofthe heart and arteries, or those catenated with pleasurable sensation, asthe powers of digestion, continue to strengthen their habits withoutinterruption. Thus though man in his sleeping state is a much less perfectanimal, than in his waking hours; and though he consumes more than onethird of his life in this his irrational situation; yet is the wisdom ofthe Author of nature manifest even in this seeming imperfection of hiswork!"|FALSE
15707|"The truth of this assertion with respect to the large muscles of the body,which are concerned in locomotion, is evident; as no one in perfect sanitywalks about in his sleep, or performs any domestic offices: and in respectto the mind, we never exercise our reason or recollection in dreams; we maysometimes seem distracted between contending passions, but we never comparetheir objects, or deliberate about the acquisition of those objects, if oursleep is perfect. And though many synchronous tribes or successive trainsof ideas may represent the houses or walks, which have real existence, yetare they here introduced by their connection with our sensations, and arein truth ideas of imagination, not of recollection."|FALSE
15707|"2. For our sensations of pleasure and pain are experienced with greatvivacity in our dreams; and hence all that motley group of ideas, which arecaused by them, called the ideas of imagination, with their variousassociated trains, are in a very vivid manner acted over in the sensorium;and these sometimes call into action the larger muscles, which have beenmuch associated with them; as appears from the muttering sentences, whichsome people utter in their dreams, and from the obscure barking of sleepingdogs, and the motions of their feet and nostrils."|FALSE
15707|"This perpetual flow of the trains of ideas, which constitute our dreams,and which are caused by painful or pleasurable sensation, might at firstview be conceived to be an useless expenditure of sensorial power. But ithas been shewn, that those motions, which are perpetually excited, as thoseof the arterial system by the stimulus of the blood, are attended by agreat accumulation of sensorial power, after they have been for a timesuspended; as the hot-fit of fever is the consequence of the cold one. Nowas these trains of ideas caused by sensation are perpetually excited duringour waking hours, if they were to be suspended in sleep like the voluntarymotions, (which are exerted only by intervals during our waking hours,) anaccumulation of sensorial power would follow; and on our awaking a deliriumwould supervene, since these ideas caused by sensation would be producedwith such energy, that we should mistake the trains of imagination forideas excited by irritation; as perpetually happens to people debilitatedby fevers on their first awaking; for in these fevers with debility thegeneral quantity of irritation being diminished, that of sensation isincreased. In like manner if the actions of the stomach, intestines, andvarious glands, which are perhaps in part at least caused by or catenatedwith agreeable sensation, and which perpetually exist during our wakinghours, were like the voluntary motions suspended in our sleep; the greataccumulation of sensorial power, which would necessarily follow, would beliable to excite inflammation in them."|FALSE
15707|"3. When by our continued posture in sleep, some uneasy sensations areproduced, we either gradually awake by the exertion of volition, or themuscles connected by habit with such sensations alter the position of thebody; but where the sleep is uncommonly profound, and those uneasysensations great, the disease called the incubus, or nightmare, isproduced. Here the desire of moving the body is painfully exerted, by thepower of moving it, or volition, is incapable of action, till we awake.Many less disagreeable struggles in our dreams, as when we wish in vain tofly from terrifying objects, constitute a slighter degree of this disease.In awaking from the nightmare I have more than once observed, that therewas no disorder in my pulse; nor do I believe the respiration is laborious,as some have affirmed. It occurs to people whose sleep is too profound, andsome disagreeable sensation exists, which at other times would haveawakened them, and have thence prevented the disease of nightmare; as aftergreat fatigue or hunger with too large a supper and wine, which occasionour sleep to be uncommonly profound. See No. 14, of this Section."|FALSE
15707|"4. As the larger muscles of the body are much more frequently excited byvolition than by sensation, they are but seldom brought into action in oursleep: but the ideas of the mind are by habit much more frequentlyconnected with sensation than with volition; and hence the ceaseless flowof our ideas in dreams. Every one's experience will teach him this truth,for we all daily exert much voluntary muscular motion: but few of mankindcan bear the fatigue of much voluntary thinking."|FALSE
15707|"5. A very curious circumstance attending these our sleeping imaginationsis, that we seem to receive them by the senses. The muscles, which aresubservient to the external organs of sense, are connected with volition,and cease to act in sleep; hence the eyelids are closed, and the tympanumof the ear relaxed; and it is probable a similarity of voluntary exertionmay be necessary for the perceptions of the other nerves of sense; for itis observed that the papillæ of the tongue can be seen to become erected,when we attempt to taste any thing extremely grateful. Hewson Exper.Enquir. V. 2. 186. Albini Annot. Acad. L. i. c. 15. Add to this, that theimmediate organs of sense have no objects to excite them in the darknessand silence of the night, but their nerves of sense nevertheless continueto possess their perfect activity subservient to all their numeroussensitive connections. This vivacity of our nerves of sense during the timeof sleep is evinced by a circumstance, which almost every one must at sometime or other have experienced; that is, if we sleep in the daylight, andendeavour to see some object in our dream, the light is exceedingly painfulto our eyes; and after repeated struggles we lament in our sleep, that wecannot see it. In this case I apprehend the eyelid is in some degree openedby the vehemence of our sensations; and, the iris being dilated, the opticnerve shews as great or greater sensibility than in our waking hours. SeeNo. 15. of this Section."|FALSE
15707|"When we are forcibly waked at midnight from profound sleep, our eyes aremuch dazzled with the light of the candle for a minute or two, after therehas been sufficient time allowed for the contraction of the iris; which isowing to the accumulation of sensorial power in the organ of vision duringits state of less activity. But when we have dreamt much of visibleobjects, this accumulation of sensorial power in the organ of vision islessened or prevented, and we awake in the morning without being dazzledwith the light, after the iris has had time to contract itself. This is amatter of great curiosity, and may be thus tried by any one in theday-light. Close your eyes, and cover them with your hat; think for aminute on a tune, which you are accustomed to, and endeavour to sing itwith as little activity of mind as possible. Suddenly uncover and open youreyes, and in one second of time the iris will contract itself, but you willperceive the day more luminous for several seconds, owing to theaccumulation of sensorial power in the optic nerve."|FALSE
15707|"Then again close and cover your eyes, and think intensely on a cube ofivory two inches diameter, attending first to the north and south sides ofit, and then to the other four sides of it; then get a clear image in yourmind's eye of all the sides of the same cube coloured red; and then of itcoloured green; and then of it coloured blue; lastly, open your eyes as inthe former experiment, and after the first second of time allowed for thecontraction of the iris, you will not perceive any increase of the light ofthe day, or dazzling; because now there is no accumulation of sensorialpower in the optic nerve; that having been expended by its action inthinking over visible objects."|FALSE
15707|"This experiment is not easy to be made at first, but by a few patienttrials the fact appears very certain; and shews clearly, that our ideas ofimagination are repetitions of the motions of the nerve, which wereoriginally occasioned by the stimulus of external bodies; because theyequally expend the sensorial power in the organ of sense. See Sect. III. 4.which is analogous to our being as much fatigued by thinking as by labour."|FALSE
15707|"6. Nor is it in our dreams alone, but even in our waking reveries, and ingreat efforts of invention, so great is the vivacity of our ideas, that wedo not for a time distinguish them from the real presence of substantialobjects; though the external organs of sense are open, and surrounded withtheir usual stimuli. Thus whilst I am thinking over the beautiful valley,through which I yesterday travelled, I do not perceive the furniture of myroom: and there are some, whose waking imaginations are so apt to run intoperfect reverie, that in their common attention to a favourite idea they donot hear the voice of the companion, who accosts them, unless it isrepeated with unusual energy."|FALSE
15707|"This perpetual mistake in dreams and reveries, where our ideas ofimagination are attended with a belief of the presence of external objects,evinces beyond a doubt, that all our ideas are repetitions of the motionsof the nerves of sense, by which they were acquired; and that this beliefis not, as some late philosophers contend, an instinct necessarilyconnected only with our perceptions."|FALSE
15707|"7. A curious question demands our attention in this place; as we do notdistinguish in our dreams and reveries between our perceptions of externalobjects, and our ideas of them in their absence, how do we distinguish themat any time? In a dream, if the sweetness of sugar occurs to myimagination, the whiteness and hardness of it, which were ideas usuallyconnected with the sweetness, immediately follow in the train; and Ibelieve a material lump of sugar present before my senses: but in my wakinghours, if the sweetness occurs to my imagination, the stimulus of the tableto my hand, or of the window to my eye, prevents the other ideas of thehardness and whiteness of the sugar from succeeding; and hence I perceivethe fallacy, and disbelieve the existence of objects correspondent to thoseideas, whose tribes or trains are broken by the stimulus of other objects.And further in our waking hours, we frequently exert our volition incomparing present appearances with such, as we have usually observed; andthus correct the errors of one sense by our general knowledge of nature byintuitive analogy. See Sect. XVII. 3. 7. Whereas in dreams the power ofvolition is suspended, we can recollect and compare our present ideas withnone of our acquired knowledge, and are hence incapable of observing anyabsurdities in them."|FALSE
15707|"By this criterion we distinguish our waking from our sleeping hours, we canvoluntarily recollect our sleeping ideas, when we are awake, and comparethem with our waking ones; but we cannot in our sleep _voluntarily_recollect our waking ideas at all."|FALSE
15707|"8. The vast variety of scenery, novelty of combination, and distinctness ofimagery, are other curious circumstances of our sleeping imaginations. Thevariety of scenery seems to arise from the superior activity and excellenceof our sense of vision; which in an instant unfolds to the mind extensivefields of pleasurable ideas; while the other senses collect their objectsslowly, and with little combination; add to this, that the ideas, whichthis organ presents us with, are more frequently connected with oursensation than those of any other."|FALSE
15707|"9. The great novelty of combination is owing to another circumstance; thetrains of ideas, which are carried on in our waking thoughts, are in ourdreams dissevered in a thousand places by the suspension of volition, andthe absence of irritative ideas, and are hence perpetually falling into newcatenations. As explained in Sect. XVII. 1. 9. For the power of volition isperpetually exerted during our waking hours in comparing our passing trainsof ideas with our acquired knowledge of nature, and thus forms manyintermediate links in their catenation. And the irritative ideas excited bythe stimulus of the objects, with which we are surrounded, are every momentintruded upon us, and form other links of our unceasing catenations ofideas."|FALSE
15707|"10. The absence of the stimuli of external bodies, and of volition, in ourdreams renders the organs of sense liable to be more strongly affected bythe powers of sensation, and of association. For our desires or aversions,or the obtrusions of surrounding bodies, dissever the sensitive andassociate tribes of ideas in our waking hours by introducing those ofirritation and volition amongst them. Hence proceeds the superiordistinctness of pleasurable or painful imagery in our sleep; for we recalthe figure and the features of a long lost friend, whom we loved, in ourdreams with much more accuracy and vivacity than in our waking thoughts.This circumstance contributes to prove, that our ideas of imagination arereiterations of those motions of our organs of sense, which were excited byexternal objects; because while we are exposed to the stimuli of presentobjects, our ideas of absent objects cannot be so distinctly formed."|FALSE
15707|"11. The rapidity of the succession of transactions in our dreams is almostinconceivable; insomuch that, when we are accidentally awakened by thejarring of a door, which is opened into our bed-chamber, we sometimes dreama whole history of thieves or fire in the very instant of awaking."|FALSE
15707|"During the suspension of volition we cannot compare our other ideas withthose of the parts of time in which they exist; that is, we cannot comparethe imaginary scene, which is before us, with those changes of it, whichprecede or follow it: because this act of comparing requires recollectionor voluntary exertion. Whereas in our waking hours, we are perpetuallymaking this comparison, and by that means our waking ideas are keptconfident with each other by intuitive analogy; but this companion retardsthe succession of them, by occasioning their repetition. Add to this, thatthe transactions of our dreams consist chiefly of visible ideas, and that awhole history of thieves and fire may be _beheld_ in an instant of timelike the figures in a picture."|FALSE
15707|"12. From this incapacity of attending to the parts of time in our dreams,arises our ignorance of the length of the night; which, but from ourconstant experience to the contrary, we should conclude was but a fewminutes, when our sleep is perfect. The same happens in our reveries; thuswhen we are possessed with vehement joy, grief, or anger, time appearsshort, for we exert no volition to compare the present scenery with thepast or future; but when we are compelled to perform those exercises ofmind or body, which, are unmixed with passion, as in travelling over adreary country, time appears long; for our desire to finish our journeyoccasions us more frequently to compare our present situation with theparts of time or place, which are before and behind us."|FALSE
15707|"So when we are enveloped in deep contemplation of any kind, or in reverie,as in reading a very interesting play or romance, we measure time veryinaccurately; and hence, if a play greatly affects our passions, theabsurdities of passing over many days or years, and or perpetual changes ofplace, are not perceived by the audience; as is experienced by every one,who reads or sees some plays of the immortal Shakespear; but it isnecessary for inferior authors to observe those rules of the [Greek:pithanon] and [Greek: prepon] inculcated by Aristotle, because their worksdo not interest the passions sufficiently to produce complete reverie."|FALSE

Forthose pleasurable ideas, which are presented to us, and are too gentle toexcite laughter, (which is attended with interrupted voluntary exertions,as explained Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.) and which are not accompanied with anyother emotion, which usually excites some voluntary exertion, as anger, orfear, are liable to produce sleep; which consists in a suspension of allvoluntary power. But if the ideas thus presented to us, and interest ourattention, are accompanied with so much pleasurable or painful sensation asto excite our voluntary exertion at the same time, reverie is theconsequence. Hence an interesting play produces reverie, a tedious oneproduces sleep: in the latter we become exhausted by attention, and are notexcited to any voluntary exertion, and therefore sleep; in the former weare excited by some emotion, which prevents by its pain the suspension ofvolition, and in as much as it interests us, induces reverie, as explainedin the next Section."|FALSE
15707|"But when our sleep is imperfect, as when we have determined to rise in halfan hour, time appears longer to us than in most other situations. Here oursolicitude not to oversleep the determined time induces us in thisimperfect sleep to compare the quick changes of imagined scenery with theparts of time or place, they would have taken up, had they real exigence;and that more frequently than in our waking hours; and hence the timeappears longer to us: and I make no doubt, but the permitted time appearslong to a man going to the gallows, as the fear of its quick lapse willmake him think frequently about it."|FALSE
15707|"13. As we gain our knowledge of time by comparing the present scenery withthe past and future, and of place by comparing the situations of objectswith each other; so we gain our idea of consciousness by comparingourselves with the scenery around us; and of identity by comparing ourpresent consciousness with our past consciousness: as we never think oftime or place, but when we make the companions above mentioned, so we neverthink of consciousness, but when we compare our own existence with that ofother objects; nor of identity, but when we compare our present and ourpast consciousness. Hence the consciousness of our own existence, and ofour identity, is owing to a voluntary exertion of our minds: and on thataccount in our complete dreams we neither measure time, are surprised atthe sudden changes of place, nor attend to our own existence, or identity;because our power of volition is suspended. But all these circumstances aremore or less observable in our incomplete ones; for then we attend a littleto the lapse of time, and the changes of place, and to our own existence;and even to our identity of person; for a lady seldom dreams, that she is asoldier; nor a man, that he is brought to bed."|FALSE
15707|"14. As long as our sensations only excite their sensual motions, or ideas,our sleep continues sound; but as soon as they excite desires or aversions,our sleep becomes imperfect; and when that desire or aversion is so strong,as to produce voluntary motions, we begin to awake; the larger muscles ofthe body are brought into action to remove that irritation or sensation,which a continued posture has caused; we stretch our limbs, and yawn, andour sleep is thus broken by the accumulation of voluntary power."|FALSE
15707|"Sometimes it happens, that the act of waking is suddenly produced, and thissoon after the commencement of sleep; which is occasioned by some sensationso disagreeable, as instantaneously to excite the power of volition; and atemporary action of all the voluntary motions suddenly succeeds, and westart awake. This is sometimes accompanied with loud noise in the ears, andwith some degree of fear; and when it is in great excess, so as to producecontinued convulsive motions of those muscles, which are generallysubservient to volition, it becomes epilepsy: the fits of which in somepatients generally commence during sleep. This differs from the night-maredescribed in No. 3. of this Section, because in that the disagreeablesensation is not so great as to excite the power of volition into action;for as soon as that happens, the disease ceases."|FALSE
15707|"Another circumstance, which sometimes awakes people soon after thecommencement of their sleep, is where the voluntary power is already sogreat in quantity as almost to prevent them from falling asleep, and then alittle accumulation of it soon again awakens them; this happens in cases ofinsanity, or where the mind has been lately much agitated by fear or anger.There is another circumstance in which sleep is likewise of short duration,which arises from great debility, as after great over-fatigue, and in somefevers, where the strength of the patient is greatly diminished, as inthese cases the pulse intermits or flutters, and the respiration ispreviously affected, it seems to originate from the want of some voluntaryefforts to facilitate respiration, as when we are awake. And is furthertreated of in Vol. II. Class I. 2. 1. 2. on the Diseases of the VoluntaryPower. Art. Somnus interruptus."|FALSE
15707|"15. We come now to those motions which depend on irritation. The motions ofthe arterial and glandular systems continue in our sleep, proceeding slowerindeed, but stronger and more uniformly, than in our waking hours, whenthey are incommoded by external stimuli, or by the movements of volition;the motions of the muscles subservient to respiration continue to bestimulated into action, and the other internal senses of hunger, thirst,and lust, are not only occasionally excited in our sleep, but theirirritative motions are succeeded by their usual sensations, and make a partof the farrago of our dreams. These sensations of the want of air, ofhunger, thirst, and lust, in our dreams, contribute to prove, that thenerves of the external senses are also alive and excitable in our sleep;but as the stimuli of external objects are either excluded from them by thedarkness and silence of the night, or their access to them is prevented bythe suspension of volition, these nerves of sense fall more readily intotheir connexions with sensation and with association; because muchsensorial power, which during the day was expended in moving the externalorgans of sense in consequence of irritation from external stimuli, or inconsequence of volition, becomes now in some degree accumulated, andrenders the internal or immediate organs of sense more easily excitable bythe other sensorial powers. Thus in respect to the eye, the irritation fromexternal stimuli, and the power of volition during our waking hours,elevate the eye-lids, adapt the aperture of the iris to the quantity oflight, the focus of the crystalline humour, and the angle of the opticaxises to the distance of the object, all which perpetual activity duringthe day expends much sensorial power, which is saved during our sleep."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, that not only those parts of the system, which are alwaysexcited by internal stimuli, as the stomach, intestinal canal, bile-ducts,and the various glands, but the organs of sense also may be more violentlyexcited into action by the irritation from internal stimuli, or bysensation, during our sleep than in our waking hours; because during thesuspension of volition, there is a greater quantity of the spirit ofanimation to be expended by the other sensorial powers. On this account ourirritability to internal stimuli, and our sensibility to pain or pleasure,is not only greater in sleep, but increases as our sleep is prolonged.Whence digestion and secretion are performed better in sleep, than in ourwaking hours, and our dreams in the morning have greater variety andvivacity, as our sensibility increases, than at night when we first liedown. And hence epileptic fits, which are always occasioned by somedisagreeable sensation, so frequently attack those, who are subject tothem, in their sleep; because at this time the system is more excitable bypainful sensation in consequence of internal stimuli; and the power ofvolition is then suddenly exerted to relieve this pain, as explained Sect.XXXIV. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"There is a disease, which frequently affects children in the cradle, whichis termed ecstasy, and seems to consist in certain exertions to relievepainful sensation, in which the voluntary power is not so far excited astotally to awaken them, and yet is sufficient to remove the disagreeablesensation, which excites it; in this case changing the posture of the childfrequently relieves it."|FALSE
15707|"I have at this time under my care an elegant young man about twenty-twoyears of age, who seldom sleeps more than an hour without experiencing aconvulsion fit; which ceases in about half a minute without any subsequentstupor. Large doses of opium only prevented the paroxysms, so long as theyprevented him from sleeping by the intoxication, which they induced. Othermedicines had no effect on him. He was gently awakened every half hour forone night, but without good effect, as he soon slept again, and the fitreturned at about the same periods of time, for the accumulated sensorialpower, which occasioned the increased sensibility to pain, was not thusexhausted. This case evinces, that the sensibility of the system tointernal excitation increases, as our sleep is prolonged; till the painthus occasioned produces voluntary exertion; which, when it is in its usualdegree, only awakens us; but when it is more violent, it occasionsconvulsions."|FALSE
15707|"The cramp in the calf of the leg is another kind of convulsion, whichgenerally commences in sleep, occasioned by the continual increase ofirritability from internal stimuli, or of sensibility, during that state ofour existence. The cramp is a violent exertion to relieve pain, generallyeither of the skin from cold, or of the bowels, as in some diarrhoeas, orfrom the muscles having been previously overstretched, as in walking up ordown steep hills. But in these convulsions of the muscles, which form thecalf of the leg, the contraction is so violent as to occasion another painin consequence of their own too violent contraction; as soon as theoriginal pain, which caused the contraction, is removed. And hence thecramp, or spasm, of these muscles is continued without intermission by thisnew pain, unlike the alternate convulsions and remissions in epilepticfits. The reason, that the contraction of these muscles of the calf of theleg is more violent during their convulsion than that of others, depends onthe weakness of their antagonist muscles; for after these have beencontracted in their usual action, as at every step in walking, they areagain extended, not, as most other muscles are, by their antagonists, butby the weight of the whole body on the balls of the toes; and that weightapplied to great mechanical advantage on the heel, that is, on the otherend of the bone of the foot, which thus acts as a lever."|FALSE
15707|"Another disease, the periods of which generally commence during our sleep,is the asthma. Whatever may be the remote cause of paroxysms of asthma, theimmediate cause of the convulsive respiration, whether in the commonasthma, or in what is termed the convulsive asthma, which are perhaps onlydifferent degrees of the same disease, must be owing to violent voluntaryexertions to relieve pain, as in other convulsions; and the increase ofirritability to internal stimuli, or of sensibility, during sleep mustoccasion them to commence at this time."|FALSE
15707|"Debilitated people, who have been unfortunately accustomed to greatingurgitation of spirituous potation, frequently part with a great quantityof water during the night, but with not more than usual in the day-time.This is owing to a beginning torpor of the absorbent system, and precedesanasarca, which commences in the day, but is cured in the night by theincrease of the irritability of the absorbent system during sleep, whichthus imbibes from the cellular membrane the fluids, which had beenaccumulated there during the day; though it is possible the horizontalposition of the body may contribute something to this purpose, and also thegreater irritability of some branches of the absorbent vessels, which opentheir mouths in the cells of the cellular membrane, than that of otherbranches."|FALSE
15707|"As soon as a person begins to sleep, the irritability and sensibility ofthe system begins to increase, owing to the suspension of volition and theexclusion of external stimuli. Hence the actions of the vessels inobedience to internal stimulation become stronger and more energetic,though less frequent in respect to number. And as many of the secretionsare increased, so the heat of the system is gradually increased, and theextremities of feeble people, which had been cold during the day, becomewarm. Till towards morning many people become so warm, as to find itnecessary to throw off some of their bed-clothes, as soon as they awake;and in others sweats are so liable to occur towards morning during theirsleep."|FALSE
15707|"Thus those, who are not accustomed to sleep in the open air, are veryliable to take cold, if they happen to fall asleep on a garden bench, or ina carriage with the window open. For as the system is warmer during sleep,as above explained, if a current of cold air affects any part of the body,a torpor of that part is more effectually produced, as when a cold blast ofair through a key-hole or casement falls upon a person in a warm room. Inthose cases the affected part possesses less irritability in respect toheat, from its having previously been exposed to a greater stimulus ofheat, as in the warm room, or during sleep; and hence, when the stimulus ofheat is diminished, a torpor is liable to ensue; that is, we take cold.Hence people who sleep in the open air, generally feel chilly both at theapproach of sleep, and on their awaking; and hence many people areperpetually subject to catarrhs if they sleep in a less warm head-dress,than that which they wear in the day."|FALSE
15707|"16. Not only the sensorial powers of irritation and of sensation, but thatof association also appear to act with greater vigour during the suspensionof volition in sleep. It will be shewn in another place, that the goutgenerally first attacks the liver, and that afterwards an inflammation ofthe ball of the great toe commences by association, and that of the liverceases. Now as this change or metastasis of the activity of the systemgenerally commences in sleep, it follows, that these associations of motionexist with greater energy at that time; that is, that the sensorial facultyof association, like those of irritation and of sensation, becomes in somemeasure accumulated during the suspension of volition."|FALSE
15707|"Other associate tribes and trains of motions, as well as the irritative andsensitive ones, appear to be increased in their activity during thesuspension of volition in sleep. As those which contribute to circulate theblood, and to perform the various secretions; as well as the associatetribes and trains of ideas, which contribute to furnish the perpetualdreams of our dreaming imaginations."|FALSE
15707|"In sleep the secretions have generally been supposed to be diminished, asthe expectorated mucus in coughs, the fluids discharged in diarrhoeas, andin salivation, except indeed the secretion of sweat, which is often visiblyincreased. This error seems to have arisen from attention to the excretionsrather than to the secretions. For the secretions, except that of sweat,are generally received into reservoirs, as the urine into the bladder, andthe mucus of the intestines and lungs into their respective cavities; butthese reservoirs do not exclude these fluids immediately by their stimulus,but require at the same time some voluntary efforts, and therefore permitthem to remain during sleep. And as they thus continue longer in thosereceptacles in our sleeping hours, a greater part is absorbed from them,and the remainder becomes thicker, and sometimes in less quantity, thoughat the time it was secreted the fluid was in greater quantity than in ourwaking hours. Thus the urine is higher coloured after long sleep; whichshews that a greater quantity has been secreted, and that more of theaqueous and saline part has been reabsorbed, and the earthy part left inthe bladder; hence thick urine in fevers shews only a greater action of thevessels which secrete it in the kidneys, and of those which absorb it fromthe bladder."|FALSE
15707|"The same happens to the mucus expectorated in coughs, which is thusthickened by absorption of its aqueous and saline parts; and the same ofthe feces of the intestines. From hence it appears, and from what has beensaid in No. 15. of this Section concerning the increase of irritability andof sensibility during sleep, that the secretions are in general ratherincreased than diminished during these hours of our existence; and it isprobable that nutrition is almost entirely performed in sleep; and thatyoung animals grow more at this time than in their waking hours, as youngplants have long since been observed to grow more in the night, which istheir time of sleep."|FALSE
15707|"17. Two other remarkable circumstances of our dreaming ideas are theirinconsistency, and the total absence of surprise. Thus we seem to bepresent at more extraordinary metamorphoses of animals or trees, than areto be met with in the fables of antiquity; and appear to be transportedfrom place to place, which seas divide, as quickly as the changes ofscenery are performed in a play-house; and yet are not sensible of theirinconsistency, nor in the least degree affected with surprise."|FALSE
15707|"We must consider this circumstance more minutely. In our waking trains ofideas, those that are inconsistent with the usual order of nature, sorarely have occurred to us, that their connexion is the slightest of allothers: hence, when a consistent train of ideas is exhausted, we attend tothe external stimuli, that usually surround us, rather than to anyinconsistent idea, which might otherwise present itself; and if aninconsistent idea should intrude itself, we immediately compare it with thepreceding one, and voluntarily reject the train it would introduce; thisappears further in the Section on Reverie, in which state of the mindexternal stimuli are not attended to, and yet the streams of ideas are keptconsistent by the efforts of volition. But as our faculty of volition issuspended, and all external stimuli are excluded in sleep, this slighterconnexion of ideas takes place; and the train is said to be inconsistent;that is, dissimilar to the usual order of nature."|FALSE
15707|"But, when any consistent train of sensitive or voluntary ideas is flowingalong, if any external stimulus affects us so violently, as to intrudeirritative ideas forcibly into the mind, it disunites the former train ofideas, and we are affected with surprise. These stimuli of unusual energyor novelty not only disunite our common trains of ideas, but the trains ofmuscular motions also, which have not been long established by habit, anddisturb those that have. Some people become motionless by great surprise,the fits of hiccup and or ague have been often removed by it, and it evenaffects the movements of the heart, and arteries; but in our sleep, allexternal stimuli are excluded, and in consequence no surprise can exist.See Section XVII. 3. 7."|FALSE
15707|"18. We frequently awake with pleasure from a dream, which has delighted us,without being able to recollect the transactions of it; unless perhaps at adistance of time, some analogous idea may introduce afresh this forgottentrain: and in our waking reveries we sometimes in a moment lose the trainof thought, but continue to feel the glow of pleasure, or the depression ofspirits, it occasioned: whilst at other times we can retrace with easethese histories of our reveries and dreams."|FALSE
15707|"The above explanation of surprise throws light upon this subject. When weare suddenly awaked by any violent stimulus, the surprise totally disunitesthe trains of our sleeping ideas from these of our waking ones; but if wegradually awake, this does not happen; and we readily unravel the precedingtrains of imagination."|FALSE
15707|"19. There are various degrees of surprise; the more intent we are upon thetrain of ideas, which we are employed about, the more violent must be thestimulus that interrupts them, and the greater is the degree of surprise. Ihave observed dogs, who have slept by the fire, and by their obscurebarking and struggling have appeared very intent on their prey, that shewedgreat surprise for a few seconds after their awaking by looking eagerlyaround them; which they did not do at other times of waking. And anintelligent friend of mine has remarked, that his lady, who frequentlyspeaks much and articulately in her sleep, could never recollect her dreamsin the morning, when this happened to her: but that when she did not speakin her sleep, she could always recollect them."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, when our sensations act so strongly in sleep as to influence thelarger muscles, as in those, who talk or struggle in their dreams; or inthose, who are affected with complete reverie (as described in the nextSection), great surprise is produced, when they awake; and these as well asthose, who are completely drunk or delirious, totally forget afterwardstheir imaginations at those times."|FALSE
15707|"20. As the immediate cause of sleep consists in the suspension of volition,it follows, that whatever diminishes the general quantity of sensorialpower, or derives it from the faculty of volition, will constitute a remotecause of sleep; such as fatigue from muscular or mental exertion, whichdiminishes the general quantity of sensorial power; or an increase of thesensitive motions, as by attending to soft music, which diverts thesensorial power from the faculty of volition; or lastly, by increase of theirritative motions, as by wine, or food; or warmth; which not only by theirexpenditure of sensorial power diminish the quantity of volition; but alsoby their producing pleasureable sensations (which occasion other muscularor sensual motions in consequence), doubly decrease the voluntary power,and thus more forcibly produce sleep. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"Another method of inducing sleep is delivered in a very ingenious worklately published by Dr. Beddoes. Who, after lamenting that opium frequentlyoccasions restlessness, thinks, \"that in most cases it would be better toinduce sleep by the abstraction of stimuli, than by exhausting theexcitability;\" and adds, \"upon this principle we could not have a bettersoporific than an atmosphere with a diminished proportion of oxygene air,and that common air might be admitted after the patient was asleep.\"(Observ. on Calculus, &c. by Dr. Beddoes, Murray.) If it should be found tobe true, that the excitability of the system depends on the quantity ofoxygene absorbed by the lungs in respiration according to the theory of Dr.Beddoes, and of M. Girtanner, this idea of sleeping in an atmosphere withless oxygene in its composition might be of great service in epilepticcases, and in cramp, and even in fits of the asthma, where their periodscommence from the increase of irritability during sleep."|FALSE
15707|"Sleep is likewise said to be induced by mechanic pressure on the brain inthe cases of spina bifida. Where there has been a defect of one of thevertebræ of the back, a tumour is protruded in consequence; and, wheneverthis tumour has been compressed by the hand, sleep is said to be induced,because the whole of the brain both within the head and spine becomescompressed by the retrocession of the fluid within the tumour. But by whatmeans a compression of the brain induces sleep has not been explained, butprobably by diminishing the secretion of sensorial power, and then thevoluntary motions become suspended previously to the irritative ones, asoccurs in most dying persons."|FALSE
15707|"Another way of procuring sleep mechanically was related to me by Mr.Brindley, the famous canal engineer, who was brought up to the business ofa mill-wright; he told me, that he had more than once seen the experimentof a man extending himself across the large stone of a corn-mill, and thatby gradually letting the stone whirl, the man fell asleep, before the stonehad gained its full velocity, and he supposed would have died without painby the continuance or increase of the motion. In this case the centrifugalmotion of the head and feet must accumulate the blood in both thoseextremities of the body, and thus compress the brain."|FALSE
15707|"Lastly, we should mention the application of cold; which, when in a lessdegree, produces watchfulness by the pain it occasions, and the tremulousconvulsions of the subcutaneous muscles; but when it is applied in greatdegree, is said to produce sleep. To explain this effect it has been said,that as the vessels of the skin and extremities become first torpid by thewant of the stimulus of heat, and as thence less blood is circulatedthrough them, as appears from their paleness, a greater quantity of bloodpoured upon the brain produces sleep by its compression of that organ. ButI should rather imagine, that the sensorial power becomes exhausted by theconvulsive actions in consequence of the pain of cold, and of the voluntaryexercise previously used to prevent it, and that the sleep is only thebeginning to die, as the suspension of voluntary power in lingering deathsprecedes for many hours the extinction of the irritative motions."|FALSE

Thus in beingpresent at a play, or in reading a romance, some persons are so totallyabsorbed as to forget their usual time of sleep, and to neglect theirmeals; while others are said to have been so involved in voluntary study asnot to have heard the discharge of artillery; and there is a story of anItalian politician, who could think so intensely on other subjects, as tobe insensible to the torture of the rack."|FALSE

And afterwards she once drank a dish of tea,when the whole apparatus of the tea-table was set before her; and expressedsome suspicion, that a medicine was put into it, and once seemed to smellof a tuberose, which was in flower in her chamber, and deliberated aloudabout breaking it from the stem, saying, \"it would make her sister socharmingly angry.\" At another time in her melancholy moments she heard thesound of a passing bell, \"I wish I was dead,\" she cried, listening to thebell, and then taking off one of her shoes, as she sat upon the bed, \"Ilove the colour black,\" says she, \"a little wider, and a little longer,even this might make me a coffin!\"--Yet it is evident, she was not sensibleat this time, any more than formerly, of seeing or hearing any person abouther; indeed when great light was thrown upon her by opening the shutters ofthe window, her trains of ideas seemed less melancholy; and when I haveforcibly held her hands, or covered her eyes, she appeared to growimpatient, and would say, she could not tell what to do, for she couldneither see nor move.

Afterwards, when the reverie became still lesscomplete from the use of opium, some few irritations were at timessucceeded by her attention to them. As when she smelt at a tuberose, anddrank a dish of tea, but this only when she seemed voluntarily to attend tothem."|FALSE
15707|"6. In common life when we listen to distant sounds, or wish to distinguishobjects in the night, we are obliged strongly to exert our volition todispose the organs of sense to perceive them, and to suppress the othertrains of ideas, which might interrupt these feeble sensations. Hence inthe present history the strongest stimuli were not perceived, except whenthe faculty of volition was exerted on the organ of sense; and then evencommon stimuli were sometimes perceived: for her mind was so strenuouslyemployed in pursuing its own trains of voluntary or sensitive ideas, thatno common stimuli could so far excite her attention as to disunite them;that is, the quantity of volition or of sensation already existing wasgreater than any, which could be produced in consequence of common degreesof stimulation. But the few stimuli of the tuberose, and of the tea, whichshe did perceive, were such, as accidentally coincided with the trains ofthought, which were passing in her mind; and hence did not disunite thosetrains, and create surprise. And their being perceived at all was owing tothe power of volition preceding or coinciding with that of irritation."|FALSE
15707|"This explication is countenanced by a fact mentioned concerning asomnambulist in the Lausanne Transactions, who sometimes opened his eyesfor a short time to examine, where he was, or where his ink-pot stood, andthen shut them again, dipping his pen into the pot every now and then, andwriting on, but never opening his eyes afterwards, although he wrote onfrom line to line regularly, and corrected some errors of the pen, or inspelling: so much easier was it to him to refer to his ideas of thepositions of things, than to his perceptions of them."|FALSE
15707|"7. The associated motions persisted in their usual channel, as appeared bythe combinations of her ideas, and the use of her muscles, and the equalityof her pulse; for the natural motions of the arterial system, thoughoriginally excited like other motions by stimulus, seem in part to continueby their association with each other. As the heart of a viper pulsates longafter it is cut out of the body, and removed from the stimulus of theblood."|FALSE
15707|"8. In the section on sleep, it was observed that the nerves of sense areequally alive and susceptible to irritation in that state, as when we areawake; but that they are secluded from stimulating objects, or renderedunfit to receive them: but in complete reverie the reverse happens, theimmediate organs of sense are exposed to their usual stimuli; but areeither not excited into action at all, or not into so great action, as toproduce attention or sensation."|FALSE

It appears from hence, that reverie is a disease of the epileptic orcataleptic kind, since the paroxysms of this young lady always began andfrequently terminated with convulsions; and though in its greatest degreeit has been called somnambulation, or sleep-walking, it is totallydifferent from sleep; because the essential character of sleep consists inthe total suspension of volition, which in reverie is not affected; and theessential character of reverie consists not in the absence of thoseirritative motions of our senses, which are occasioned by the stimulus ofexternal objects, but in their never being productive of sensation. So thatduring a fit of reverie that strange event happens to the whole system ofnerves, which occurs only to some particular branches of them in those, whoare a second time exposed to the action of contagious matter. If the matterof the small-pox be inserted into the arm of one, who has previously hadthat disease, it will stimulate the wound, but the general sensation orinflammation of the system does not follow, which constitutes the disease.See Sect.

This circumstance not having been attended to by the writers onvision, the disease called vertigo or dizziness has been little understood."|FALSE
15707|"When any person loses the power of muscular action, whether he is erect orin a sitting posture, he sinks down upon the ground; as is seen in faintingfits, and other instances of great debility. Hence it follows, that someexertion of muscular power is necessary to preserve our perpendicularattitude. This is performed by proportionally exerting the antagonistmuscles of the trunk, neck, and limbs; and if at any time in ourlocomotions we find ourselves inclining to one side, we either restore ourequilibrium by the efforts of the muscles on the other side, or by movingone of our feet extend the base, which we rest upon, to the new center ofgravity."|FALSE
15707|"But the most easy and habitual manner of determining our want ofperpendicularity, is by attending to the apparent motion of the objectswithin the sphere of distinct vision; for this apparent motion of objects,when we incline from our perpendicularity, or begin to fall, is as muchgreater than the real motion of the eye, as the diameter of the sphere ofdistinct vision is to our perpendicular height."|FALSE
15707|"Hence no one, who is hood-winked, can walk in a straight line for a hundredsteps together; for he inclines so greatly, before he is warned of his wantof perpendicularity by the sense of touch, not having the apparent motionsof ambient objects to measure this inclination by, that he is necessitatedto move one of his feet outwards, to the right or to the left, to supportthe new centre of gravity, and thus errs from the line he endeavours toproceed in."|FALSE
15707|"For the same reason many people become dizzy, when they look from thesummit of a tower, which is raised much above all other objects, as theseobjects are out of the sphere of distinct vision, and they are obliged tobalance their bodies by the less accurate feelings of their muscles."|FALSE
15707|"There is another curious phenomenon belonging to this place, if thecircumjacent visible objects are so small, that we do not distinguish theirminute parts; or so similar, that we do not know them from each other; wecannot determine our perpendicularity by them. Thus in a room hung with apaper, which is coloured over with similar small black lozenges orrhomboids, many people become dizzy; for when they begin to fall, the nextand the next lozenge succeeds upon the eye; which they mistake for thefirst, and are not aware, that they have any apparent motion. But if youfix a sheet of paper, or draw any other figure, in the midst of theselozenges, the charm ceases, and no dizziness is perceptible.--The sameoccurs, when we ride over a plain covered with snow without trees or othereminent objects."|FALSE
15707|"2. But after having compared visible objects at rest with the sense oftouch, and learnt to distinguish their shapes and shades, and to measureour want of perpendicularity by their apparent motions, we come to considerthem in real motion. Here a new difficulty occurs, and we require someexperience to learn the peculiar mode of motion of any moving objects,before we can make use of them for the purposes of determining ourperpendicularity. Thus some people become dizzy at the sight of a whirlingwheel, or by gazing on the fluctuations of a river, if no steady objectsare at the same time within the sphere of their distinct vision; and when achild first can stand erect upon his legs, if you gain his attention to awhite handkerchief steadily extended like a sail, and afterwards make itundulate, he instantly loses his perpendicularity, and tumbles on theground."|FALSE
15707|"3. A second difficulty we have to encounter is to distinguish our own realmovements from the apparent motions of objects. Our daily practice ofwalking and riding on horseback soon instructs us with accuracy to discernthese modes of motion, and to ascribe the apparent motions of the ambientobjects to ourselves; but those, which we have not acquired by repeatedhabit, continue to confound us. So as we ride on horseback the trees andcottages, which occur to us, appear at rest; we can measure their distanceswith our eye, and regulate our attitude by them; yet if we carelesslyattend to distant hills or woods through a thin hedge, which is near us, weobserve the jumping and progressive motions of them; as this is increasedby the paralax of these objects; which we have not habituated ourselves toattend to. When first an European mounts an elephant sixteen feet high, andwhose mode of motion he is not accustomed to, the objects seem to undulate,as he passes, and he frequently becomes sick and vertiginous, as I am wellinformed. Any other unusual movement of our bodies has the same effect, asriding backwards in a coach, swinging on a rope, turning round swiftly onone leg, scating on the ice, and a thousand others. So after a patient hasbeen long confined to his bed, when he first attempts to walk, he findshimself vertiginous, and is obliged by practice to learn again theparticular modes of the apparent motions of objects, as he walks by them."|FALSE
15707|"4. A third difficulty, which occurs to us in learning to balance ourselvesby the eye, is, when both ourselves and the circumjacent objects are inreal motion. Here it is necessary, that we should be habituated to boththese modes of motion in order to preserve our perpendicularity. Thus onhorseback we accurately observe another person, whom we meet, trottingtowards us, without confounding his jumping and progressive motion with ourown, because we have been accustomed to them both; that is, to undergo theone, and to see the other at the same time. But in riding over a broad andfluctuating stream, though we are well experienced in the motions of ourhorse, we are liable to become dizzy from our inexperience in that of thewater. And when first we go on ship-board, where the movements ofourselves, and the movements of the large waves are both new to us, thevertigo is almost unavoidable with the terrible sickness, which attends it.And this I have been assured has happened to several from being removedfrom a large ship into a small one; and again from a small one into a manof war."|FALSE
15707|"5. From the foregoing examples it is evident, that, when we are surroundedwith unusual motions, we lose our perpendicularity: but there are somepeculiar circumstances attending this effect of moving objects, which wecome now to mention, and shall hope from the recital of them to gain someinsight into the manner of their production."|FALSE
15707|"When a child moves round quick upon one foot, the circumjacent objectsbecome quite indistinct, as their distance increases their apparentmotions; and this great velocity confounds both their forms, and theircolours, as is seen in whirling round a many coloured wheel; he then loseshis usual method of balancing himself by vision, and begins to stagger, andattempts to recover himself by his muscular feelings. This staggering addsto the instability of the visible objects by giving a vibratory motionbesides their rotatory one. The child then drops upon the ground, and theneighbouring objects seem to continue for some seconds of time to circulatearound him, and the earth under him appears to librate like a balance. Insome seconds of time these sensations of a continuation of the motion ofobjects vanish; but if he continues turning round somewhat longer, beforehe falls, sickness and vomiting are very liable to succeed. But none ofthese circumstances affect those who have habituated themselves to thiskind of motion, as the dervises in Turkey, amongst whom these swiftgyrations are a ceremony of religion."|FALSE
15707|"In an open boat passing from Leith to Kinghorn in Scotland, a sudden changeof the wind shook the undistended sail, and stopt our boat; from thisunusual movement the passengers all vomited except myself. I observed, thatthe undulation of the ship, and the instability of all visible objects,inclined me strongly to be sick; and this continued or increased, when Iclosed my eyes, but as often as I bent my attention with energy on themanagement and mechanism of the ropes and sails, the sickness ceased; andrecurred again, as often as I relaxed this attention; and I am assured by agentleman of observation and veracity, that he has more than once observed,when the vessel has been in immediate danger, that the sea-sickness of thepassengers has instantaneously ceased, and recurred again, when the dangerwas over."|FALSE
15707|"Those, who have been upon the water in a boat or ship so long, that theyhave acquired the necessary habits of motion upon that unstable element, attheir return on land frequently think in their reveries, or betweensleeping and waking, that they observe the room, they sit in, or some ofits furniture, to librate like the motion of the vessel. This I haveexperienced myself, and have been told, that after long voyages, it is sometime before these ideas entirely vanish. The same is observable in a lessdegree after having travelled some days in a stage coach, and particularlywhen we lie down in bed, and compose ourselves to sleep; in this case it isobservable, that the rattling noise of the coach, as well as the undulatorymotion, haunts us. The drunken vertigo, and the vulgar custom of rockingchildren, will be considered in the next Section."|FALSE
15707|"6. The motions, which are produced by the power of volition, may beimmediately stopped by the exertion of the same power on the antagonistmuscles; otherwise these with all the other classes of motion continue togo on, some time after they are excited, as the palpitation of the heartcontinues after the object of fear, which occasioned it, is removed. Butthis circumstance is in no class of motions more remarkable than in thosedependent on irritation; thus if any one looks at the sun, and then covershis eyes with his hand, he will for many seconds of time, perceive theimage of the sun marked on his retina: a similar image of all other visibleobjects would remain some time formed on the retina, but is extinguished bythe perpetual change of the motions of this nerve in our attention to otherobjects. To this must be added, that the longer time any movements havecontinued to be excited without fatigue to the organ, the longer will theycontinue spontaneously, after the excitement is withdrawn: as the taste oftobacco in the mouth after a person has been smoaking it."|FALSE

15707|"    After revolving with your eyes open till you become vertiginous, as    soon as you cease to revolve, not only the circum-ambient objects    appear to circulate round you in a direction contrary to that, in which    you have been turning, but you are liable to roll your eyes forwards    and backwards; as is well observed, and ingeniously demonstrated by Dr.    Wells in a late publication on vision. The same occurs, if you revolve    with your eyes closed, and open them immediately at the time of your    ceasing to turn; and even during the whole time of revolving, as may be    felt by your hand pressed lightly on your closed eyelids. To these    movements of the eyes, of which he supposes the observer to be    inconscious, Dr. Wells ascribes the apparent circumgyration of objects    on ceasing to revolve."|FALSE
15707|"    The cause of thus turning our eyes forwards, and then back again, after    our body is at rest, depends, I imagine, on the same circumstance,    which induces us to follow the indistinct spectra, which are formed on    one side of the center of the retina, when we observe them apparently    on clouds, as described in Sect. XL. 2. 2.; and then not being able to    gain a more distinct vision of them, we turn our eyes back, and again    and again pursue the flying shade."|FALSE
15707|"    But this rolling of the eyes, after revolving till we become    vertiginous, cannot cause the apparent circumgyration of objects, in a    direction contrary to that in which we have been revolving, for the    following reasons. 1. Because in pursuing a spectrum in the sky, or on    the ground, as above mentioned, we perceive no retrograde motions of    objects. 2. Because the apparent retrograde motions of objects, when we    have revolved till we are vertiginous, continues much longer than the    rolling of the eyes above described."|FALSE
15707|"    3. When we have revolved from right to left, the apparent motion of    objects, when we stop, is from left to right; and when we have revolved    from left to right, the apparent circulation of objects is from right    to left; yet in both these cases the eyes of the revolver are seen    equally to roll forwards and backwards."|FALSE
15707|"    4. Because this rolling of the eyes backwards and forwards takes place    during our revolving, as may be perceived by the hand lightly pressed    on the closed eyelids, and therefore exists before the effect ascribed    to it."|FALSE
15707|"    And fifthly, I now come to relate an experiment, in which the rolling    of the eyes does not take place at all after revolving, and yet the    vertigo is more distressing than in the situations above mentioned. If    any one looks steadily at a spot in the ceiling over his head, or    indeed at his own finger held up high over his head, and in that    situation turns round till he becomes giddy; and then stops, and looks    horizontally; he now finds, that the apparent rotation of objects is    from above downwards, or from below upwards; that is, that the apparent    circulation of objects is now vertical instead of horizontal, making    part of a circle round the axis of his _eye_; and this without any    rolling of his eyeballs. The reason of there being no rolling of the    eyeballs, perceived after this experiment, is, because the images of    objects are formed in rotation round the axis of the eye, and not from    one side to the other of the axis of it; so that, as the eyeball has    not power to turn in its socket round its own axis, it cannot follow    the apparent motions of these evanescent spectra, either before or    after the body is at rest. From all which arguments it is manifest,    that these apparent retrograde gyrations of objects are not caused by    the rolling of the eyeballs; first, because no apparent retrogression    of objects is observed in other rollings of the eyes: secondly, because    the apparent retrogression of objects continues many seconds after the    rolling of the eyeballs ceases. Thirdly, because the apparent    retrogression of objects is sometimes one way, and sometimes another,    yet the rolling of the eyeballs is the same. Fourthly, because the    rolling of the eyeballs exists before the apparent retrograde motions    of objects is observed; that is, before the revolving person stops. And    fifthly, because the apparent retrograde gyration of objects is    produced, when there is no rolling of the eyeballs at all."|FALSE
15707|"    Doctor Wells imagines, that no spectra can be gained in the eye, if a    person revolves with his eyelids closed, and thinks this a sufficient    argument against the opinion, that the apparent progression of the    spectra of light or colours in the eye can cause the apparent    retrogression of objects in the vertigo above described; but it is    certain, when any person revolves in a light room with his eyes closed,    that he nevertheless perceives differences of light both in quantity    and colour through his eyelids, as he turns round; and readily gains    spectra of those differences. And these spectra are not very different    except in vivacity from those, which he acquires, when he revolves with    unclosed eyes, since if he then revolves very rapidly the colours and    forms of surrounding objects are as it were mixed together in his eye;.    as when, the prismatic colours are painted on a wheel, they appear    white as they revolve. The truth of this is evinced by the staggering    or vertigo of men perfectly blind, when they turn round; which is not    attended with apparent circulation of objects, but is a vertiginous    disorder of the sense of touch. Blind men balance themselves by their    sense of touch; which, being less adapted for perceiving small    deviations from their perpendicular, occasions them to carry themselves    more erect in walking. This method of balancing themselves by the    direction of their pressure against the floor, becomes disordered by    the unusual mode of action in turning round, and they begin to lose    their perpendicularity, that is, they become vertiginous; but without    any apparent circular motions of visible objects."|FALSE
15707|"    It will appear from the following experiments, that the apparent    progression of the ocular spectra of light or colours is the cause of    the apparent retrogression of objects, after a person has revolved,    till he is vertiginous."|FALSE
15707|"    First, when a person turns round in a light room with his eyes open,    but closes them before he stops, he will seem to be carried forwards in    the direction he was turning for a short time after he stops. But if he    opens his eyes again, the objects before him instantly appear to move    in a retrograde direction, and he loses the sensation of being carried    forwards. The same occurs if a person revolves in a light room with his    eyes closed; when he stops, he seems to be for a time carried forwards,    if his eyes are still closed; but the instant he opens them, the    surrounding objects appear to move in retrograde gyration. From hence    it may be concluded, that it is the sensation or imagination of our    continuing to go forwards in the direction in which we were turning,    that causes the apparent retrograde circulation of objects."|FALSE
15707|"    Secondly, though there is an audible vertigo, as is known by the    battement, or undulations of sound in the ears, which many vertiginous    people experience; and though there is also a tangible vertigo, as when    a blind person turns round, as mentioned above; yet as this    circumgyration of objects is an hallucination or deception of the sense    of sight, we are to look for the cause of our appearing to move    forward, when we stop with our eyes closed after gyration, to some    affection of this sense. Now, thirdly, if the spectra formed in the eye    during our rotation, continue to change, when we stand still, like the    spectra described in Sect. III. 3. 6. such changes must suggest to us    the idea or sensation of our still continuing to turn round; as is the    case, when we revolve in a light room, and close our eyes before we    stop. And lastly, on opening our eyes in the situation above described,    the objects we chance to view amid these changing spectra in the eye,    must seem to move in a contrary direction; as the moon sometimes    appears to move retrograde, when swift-gliding clouds are passing    forwards so much nearer the eye of the beholder."|FALSE
15707|"    To make observations on faint ocular spectra requires some degree of    habit, and composure of mind, and even patience; some of those    described in Sect. XL. were found difficult to see, by many, who tried    them; now it happens, that the mind, during the confusion of vertigo,    when all the other irritative tribes of motion, as well as those of    vision, are in some degree disturbed, together with the fear of    falling, is in a very unfit state for the contemplation of such weak    sensations, as are occasioned by faint ocular spectra. Yet after    frequently revolving, both with my eyes closed, and with them open, and    attending to the spectra remaining in them, by shading the light from    my eyelids more or less with my hand, I at length ceased to have the    idea of going forward, after I stopped with my eyes closed; and saw    changing spectra in my eyes, which seemed to move, as it were, over the    field of vision; till at length, by repeated trials on sunny days, I    persuaded myself, on opening my eyes, after revolving some time, on a    shelf of gilded books in my library, that I could perceive the spectra    in my eyes move forwards over one or two of the books, like the vapours    in the air of a summer's day; and could so far undeceive myself, as to    perceive the books to stand still. After more trials I sometimes    brought myself to believe, that I saw changing spectra of lights and    shades moving in my eyes, after turning round for some time, but did    not imagine either the spectra or the objects to be in a state of    gyration. I speak, however, with diffidence of these facts, as I could    not always make the experiments succeed, when there was not a strong    light in my room, or when my eyes were not in the most proper state for    such observations."|FALSE
15707|"    The ingenious and learned M. Sauvage has mentioned other theories to    account for the apparent circumgyration of objects in vertiginous    people. As the retrograde motions of the particles of blood in the    optic arteries, by spasm, or by fear, as is seen in the tails of    tadpoles, and membranes between the fingers of frogs. Another cause he    thinks may be from the librations to one side, and to the other, of the    crystalline lens in the eye, by means of involuntary actions of the    muscles, which constitute the ciliary process. Both these theories lie    under the same objection as that of Dr. Wells before mentioned; namely,    that the apparent motions of objects, after the observer has revolved    for some time, should appear to vibrate this way and that; and not to    circulate uniformly in a direction contrary to that, in which the    observer had revolved."|FALSE
15707|"    M. Sauvage has, lastly, mentioned the theory of colours left in the    eye, which he has termed impressions on the retina. He says,    \"Experience teaches us, that impressions made on the retina by a    visible object remain some seconds after the object is removed; as    appears from the circle of fire which we see, when a fire-stick is    whirled round in the dark; therefore when we are carried round our own    axis in a circle, we undergo a temporary vertigo, when we stop; because    the impressions of the circumjacent objects remain for a time    afterwards on the retina.\" Nosolog. Method. Clas. VIII. I. 1. We have    before observed, that the changes of these colours remaining in the    eye, evinces them to be motions of the fine terminations of the retina,    and not impressions on it; as impressions on a passive substance must    either remain, or cease intirely. See an additional note at the end of    the second volume."|FALSE
15707|"Any one, who stands alone on the top of a high tower, if he has not beenaccustomed to balance himself by objects placed at such distances and withsuch inclinations, begins to stagger, and endeavours to recover himself byhis muscular feelings. During this time the apparent motion of objects at adistance below him is very great, and the spectra of these apparent motionscontinue a little time after he has experienced them; and he is persuadedto incline the contrary way to counteract their effects; and eitherimmediately falls, or applying his hands to the building, uses his muscularfeelings to preserve his perpendicular attitude, contrary to the erroneouspersuasions of his eyes. Whilst the person, who walks in the dark,staggers, but without dizziness; for he neither has the sensation of movingobjects to take off his attention from his muscular feelings, nor has hethe spectra of those motions continued on his retina to add to hisconfusion. It happens indeed sometimes to one landing on a tower, that theidea of his not having room to extend his base by moving one of his feetoutwards, when he begins to incline, superadds fears to his otherinconveniences; which like surprise, joy, or any great degree of sensation,enervates him in a moment, by employing the whole sensorial power, and bythus breaking all the associated trains and tribes of motion."|FALSE
15707|"7. The irritative ideas of objects, whilst we are awake, are perpetuallypresent to our sense of sight; as we view the furniture of our rooms, orthe ground, we tread upon, throughout the whole day without attending toit. And as our bodies are never at perfect rest during our waking hours,these irritative ideas of objects are attended perpetually with irritativeideas of their apparent motions. The ideas of apparent motions are alwaysirritative ideas, because we never attend to them, whether we attend to theobjects themselves, or to their real motions, or to neither. Hence theideas of the apparent motions of objects are a complete circle ofirritative ideas, which continue throughout the day."|FALSE
15707|"Also during all our waking hours, there is a perpetual confused sound ofvarious bodies, as of the wind in our rooms, the fire, distantconversations, mechanic business; this continued buzz, as we are seldomquite motionless, changes its loudness perpetually, like the sound of abell; which rises and falls as long as it continues, and seems to pulsateon the ear. This any one may experience by turning himself round near awaterfall; or by striking a glass bell, and then moving the direction ofits mouth towards the ears, or from them, as long as its vibrationscontinue. Hence this undulation of indistinct sound makes anotherconcomitant circle of irritative ideas, which continues throughout the day."|FALSE

When abell is struck, the circular form is changed into an eliptic one; thelongest axis of which, as the vibrations continue, moves round theperiphery of the bell; and when either axis of this elipse is pointedtowards our ears, the sound is louder; and less when the intermediate partsof the elipse are opposite to us. The vibrations of the two organ-pipes maybe compared to Nonius's rule; the sound is louder, when they coincide, andless at the intermediate times. But, as the sound of bells is the mostfamiliar of those sounds, which have a considerable battement, thevertiginous patients, who attend to the irritative circles of sounds abovedescribed, generally compare it to the noise of bells."|FALSE
15707|"The peristaltic motions of our stomach and intestines, and the secretionsof the various glands, are other circles of irritative motions, some ofthem more or less complete, according to our abstinence or satiety."|FALSE

15707|"8. Hence a violent vertigo, from whatever cause it happens, is generallyattended with undulating noise in the head, perversions of the motions ofthe stomach and duodenum, unusual excretion of bile and gastric juice, withmuch pale urine, sometimes with yellowness of the skin, and a disorderedsecretion of almost every gland of the body, till at length the arterialsystem is affected, and fever succeeds."|FALSE
15707|"Thus bilious vomitings accompany the vertigo occasioned by the motion of aship; and when the brain is rendered vertiginous by a paralytic affectionof any part of the body, a vomiting generally ensues, and a great dischargeof bile: and hence great injuries of the head from external violence aresucceeded with bilious vomitings, and sometimes with abscesses of theliver. And hence, when a patient is inclined to vomit from other causes, asin some fevers, any motions of the attendants in his room, or of himselfwhen he is raised or turned in his bed, presently induces the vomiting bysuperadding a degree of vertigo."|FALSE
15707|"9. And conversely it is very usual with those, whose stomachs are affectedfrom internal causes, to be afflicted with vertigo, and noise in the head;such is the vertigo of drunken people, which continues, when their eyes areclosed, and themselves in a recumbent posture, as well as when they are inan erect posture, and have their eyes open. And thus the irritation of astone in the bile-duct, or in the ureter, or an inflammation of any of theintestines, are accompanied with vomitings and vertigo."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the irritative motions of the stomach, which are in generalnot attended to, become so changed by some unnatural stimulus, as to becomeuneasy, and excite our sensation or attention. And thus the otherirritative trains of motions, which are associated with it, becomedisordered by their sympathy. The same happens, when a piece of gravelsticks in the ureter, or when some part of the intestinal canal becomesinflamed. In these cases the irritative muscular motions are firstdisturbed by unusual stimulus, and a disordered action of the sensualmotions, or dizziness ensues. While in sea-sickness the irritative sensualmotions, as vertigo, precedes; and the disordered irritative muscularmotions, as those of the stomach in vomiting, follow."|FALSE
15707|"10. When these irritative motions are disturbed, if the degree be not verygreat, the exertion of voluntary attention to any other object, or anysudden sensation, will disjoin these new habits of motion. Thus somedrunken people have become sober immediately, when any accident hasstrongly excited their attention; and sea-sickness has vanished, when theship has been in danger. Hence when our attention to other objects is mostrelaxed, as just before we fall asleep, or between our reveries when awake,these irritative ideas of motion and sound are most liable to be perceived;as those, who have been at sea, or have travelled long in a coach, seem toperceive the vibrations of the ship, or the rattling of the wheels, atthese intervals; which cease again, as soon as they exert their attention.That is, at those intervals they attend to the apparent motions, and to thebattement of sounds of the bodies around them, and for a moment mistakethem for those real motions of the ship, and noise of wheels, which theyhad lately been accustomed to: or at these intervals of reverie, or on theapproach of sleep, these supposed motions or sounds may be producedentirely by imagination."|FALSE
15707|"We may conclude from this account of vertigo, that sea-sickness is not aneffort of nature to relieve herself, but a necessary consequence of theassociations or catenations of animal motions. And may thence infer, thatthe vomiting, which attends the gravel in the ureter, inflammations of thebowels, and the commencement of some fevers, has a similar origin, and isnot always an effort of the vis medicatrix naturæ. But where the action ofthe organ is the immediate consequence of the stimulating cause, it isfrequently exerted to dislodge that stimulus, as in vomiting up an emeticdrug; at other times, the action of an organ is a general effort to relievepain, as in convulsions of the locomotive muscles; other actions drink upand carry on the fluids, as in absorption and secretion; all which may betermed efforts of nature to relieve, or to preserve herself."|FALSE
15707|"11. The cure of vertigo will frequently depend on our previouslyinvestigating the cause of it, which from what has been delivered above mayoriginate from the disorder of any part of the great tribes of irritativemotions, and of the associate motions catenated with them."|FALSE
15707|"Many people, when they arrive at fifty or sixty years of age, are affectedwith slight vertigo; which is generally but wrongly ascribed toindigestion, but in reality arises from a beginning defect of their sight;as about this time they also find it necessary to begin to use spectacles,when they read small prints, especially in winter, or by candle light, butare yet able to read without them during the summer days, when the light isstronger. These people do not see objects so distinctly as formerly, and byexerting their eyes more than usual, they perceive the apparent motions ofobjects, and confound them with the real motions of them; and thereforecannot accurately balance themselves so as easily to preserve theirperpendicularity by them."|FALSE
15707|"That is, the apparent motions of objects, which are at rest, as we move bythem, should only excite irritative ideas: but as these are now become lessdistinct, owing to the beginning imperfection of our sight, we are induced_voluntarily_ to attend to them; and then these apparent motions becomesucceeded by sensation; and thus the other parts of the trains ofirritative ideas, or irritative muscular motions, become disordered, asexplained above. In these cases of slight vertigo I have always promised mypatients, that they would get free from it in two or three months, as theyshould acquire the habit of balancing their bodies by less distinctobjects, and have seldom been mistaken in my prognostic."|FALSE
15707|"There is an auditory vertigo, which is called a noise in the head,explained in No. 7. of this section, which also is very liable to affectpeople in the advance of life, and is owing to their hearing less perfectlythan before. This is sometimes called a ringing, and sometimes a singing,or buzzing, in the ears, and is occasioned by our first experiencing adisagreeable sensation from our not being able distinctly to hear thesounds, we used formerly to hear distinctly. And this disagreeablesensation excites desire and consequent volition; and when we voluntarilyattend to small indistinct sounds, even the whispering of the air in aroom, and the pulsations of the arteries of the ear are succeeded bysensation; which minute sounds ought only to have produced irritativesensual motions, or unperceived ideas.

15707|"Another kind of vertigo begins with the disordered action of someirritative muscular motions, as those of the stomach from intoxication, orfrom emetics; or those of the ureter, from the stimulus of a stone lodgedin it; and it is probable, that the disordered motions of some of the greatcongeries of glands, as of those which form the liver, or of the intestinalcanal, may occasion vertigo in consequence of their motions beingassociated or catenated with the great circles of irritative motions; andfrom hence it appears, that the means of cure must be adapted to the cause."|FALSE
15707|"To prevent sea-sickness it is probable, that the habit of swinging for aweek or two before going on shipboard might be of service. For the vertigofrom failure of sight, spectacles may be used.

In the state of nature when the sense of hunger is appeased by thestimulus of agreeable food, the business of the day is over, and the humansavage is at peace with the world, he then exerts little attention toexternal objects, pleasing reveries of imagination succeed, and at lengthsleep is the result: till the nourishment which he has procured, is carriedover every part of the system to repair the injuries of action, and heawakens with fresh vigour, and feels a renewal of his sense of hunger."|FALSE
15707|"The juices of some bitter vegetables, as of the poppy and the laurocerasus,and the ardent spirit produced in the fermentation of the sugar found invegetable juices, are so agreeable to the nerves of the stomach, that,taken in a small quantity, they instantly pacify the sense of hunger; andthe inattention to external stimuli with the reveries of imagination, andsleep, succeeds, in the same manner as when the stomach is filled withother less intoxicating food."|FALSE
15707|"This inattention to the irritative motions occasioned by external stimuliis a very important circumstance in the approach of sleep, and is producedin young children by rocking their cradles: during which all visibleobjects become indistinct to them. An uniform soft repeated sound, as themurmurs of a gentle current, or of bees, are said to produce the sameeffect, by presenting indistinct ideas of inconsequential sounds, and bythus stealing our attention from other objects, whilst by their continuedreiterations they become familiar themselves, and we cease gradually toattend to any thing, and sleep ensues."|FALSE
15707|"2. After great fatigue or inanition, when the stomach is suddenly filledwith flesh and vegetable food, the inattention to external stimuli, and thereveries of imagination, become so conspicuous as to amount to a degree ofintoxication. The same is at any time produced by superadding a little wineor opium to our common meals; or by taking these separately in considerablequantity; and this more efficaciously after fatigue or inanition; because aless quantity of any stimulating material will excite an organ intoenergetic action, after it has lately been torpid from defect of stimulus;as objects appear more luminous, after we have been in the dark; andbecause the suspension of volition, which is the immediate cause of sleep,is sooner induced, after a continued voluntary exertion has in partexhausted the sensorial power of volition; in the same manner as we cannotcontract a single muscle long together without intervals of inaction."|FALSE
15707|"3. In the beginning of intoxication we are inclined to sleep, as mentionedabove, but by the excitement of external circumstances, as of noise, light,business, or by the exertion of volition, we prevent the approaches of it,and continue to take into our stomach greater quantities of the inebriatingmaterials. By these means the irritative movements of the stomach areexcited into greater action than is natural; and in consequence all theirritative tribes and trains of motion, which are catenated with them,become susceptible of stronger action from their accustomed stimuli;because these motions are excited both by their usual irritation, and bytheir association with the increased actions of the stomach and lacteals.Hence the skin glows, and the heat of the body is increased, by the moreenergetic action of the whole glandular system; and pleasure is introducedin consequence of these increased motions from internal stimulus. Accordingto Law 5. Sect. IV. on Animal Causation."|FALSE
15707|"From this great increase of irritative motions from internal stimulus, andthe increased sensation introduced into the system in consequence; andsecondly, from the increased sensitive motions in consequence of thisadditional quantity of sensation, so much sensorial power is expended, thatthe voluntary power becomes feebly exerted, and the irritation from thestimulus of external objects is less forcible; the external parts of theeye are not therefore voluntarily adapted to the distances of objects,whence the apparent motions of those objects either are seen double, orbecome too indistinct for the purpose of balancing the body, and vertigo isinduced."|FALSE
15707|"Hence we become acquainted with that very curious circumstance, why thedrunken vertigo is attended with an increase of pleasure; for theirritative ideas and motions occasioned by internal stimulus, that were notattended to in our sober hours, are now just so much increased as to besucceeded by pleasurable sensation, in the same manner as the more violentmotions of our organs are succeeded by painful sensation. And hence agreater quantity of pleasurable sensation is introduced into theconstitution; which is attended in some people with an increase ofbenevolence and good humour."|FALSE
15707|"If the apparent motions of objects is much increased, as when we revolve onone foot, or are swung on a rope, the ideas of these apparent motions arealso attended to, and are succeeded with pleasureable sensation, till theybecome familiar to us by frequent use. Hence children are at firstdelighted with these kinds of exercise, and with riding, and failing, andhence rocking young children inclines them to sleep. For though in thevertigo from intoxication the irritative ideas of the apparent motions ofobjects are indistinct from their decrease of energy: yet in the vertigooccasioned by rocking or swinging the irritative ideas of the apparentmotions of objects are increased in energy, and hence they induce pleasureinto the system, but are equally indistinct, and in consequence equallyunfit to balance ourselves by. This addition of pleasure precludes desireor aversion, and in consequence the voluntary power is feebly exerted, andon this account rocking young children inclines them to sleep."|FALSE
15707|"In what manner opium and wine act in relieving pain is another article,that well deserves our attention. There are many pains that originate fromdefect as well as from excess of stimulus; of these are those of the sixappetites of hunger, thirst, lust, the want of heat, of distention, and offresh air. Thus if our cutaneous capillaries cease to act from thediminished stimulus of heat, when we are exposed to cold weather, or ourstomach is uneasy for want of food; these are both pains from defect ofstimulus, and in consequence opium, which stimulates all the moving systeminto increased action, must relieve them. But this is not the case in thosepains, which arise from excess of stimulus, as in violent inflammations: inthese the exhibition of opium is frequently injurious by increasing theaction of the system already too great, as in inflammation of the bowelsmortification is often produced by the stimulus of opium. Where, however,no such bad consequences follow; the stimulus of opium, by increasing allthe motions of the system, expends so much of the sensorial power, that theactions of the whole system soon become feebler, and in consequence thosewhich produced the pain and inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"4. When intoxication proceeds a little further, the quantity of pleasurablesensation is so far increased, that all desire ceases, for there is no painin the system to excite it. Hence the voluntary exertions are diminished,staggering and stammering succeed; and the trains of ideas become more andmore inconsistent from this defect of voluntary exertion, as explained inthe sections on sleep and reverie, whilst those passions which are unmixedwith volition are more vividly felt, and shewn with less reserve; hencepining love, or superstitious fear, and the maudling tear dropped on theremembrance of the most trifling distress."|FALSE
15707|"5. At length all these circumstances are increased; the quantity ofpleasure introduced into the system by the increased irritative muscularmotions of the whole sanguiferous, and glandular, and absorbent systems,becomes so great, that the organs of sense are more forcibly excited intoaction by this internal pleasurable sensation, than by the irritation fromthe stimulus of external objects. Hence the drunkard ceases to attend toexternal stimuli, and as volition is now also suspended, the trains of hisideas become totally inconsistent as in dreams, or delirium: and at lengtha stupor succeeds from the great exhaustion of sensorial power, whichprobably does not even admit of dreams, and in which, as in apoplexy, nomotions continue but those from internal stimuli, from sensation, and fromassociation."|FALSE
15707|"6. In other people a paroxysm of drunkenness has another termination; theinebriate, as soon as he begins to be vertiginous, makes pale urine ingreat quantities and very frequently, and at length becomes sick, vomitsrepeatedly, or purges, or has profuse sweats, and a temporary fever ensueswith a quick strong pulse. This in some hours is succeeded by sleep; butthe unfortunate bacchanalian does not perfectly recover himself till aboutthe same time of the succeeding day, when his course of inebriation began.As shewn in Sect. XVII. 1. 7. on Catenation. The temporary fever withstrong pulse is owing to the same cause as the glow on the skin mentionedin the third paragraph of this Section: the flow of urine and sicknessarises from the whole system of irritative motions being thrown intoconfusion by their associations with each other; as in sea-sickness,mentioned in Sect. XX. 4. on Vertigo; and which is more fully explained inSection XXIX. on Diabetes."|FALSE
15707|"7. In this vertigo from internal causes we see objects double, as twocandles instead of one, which is thus explained. Two lines drawn throughthe axes of our two eyes meet at the object we attend to: this angle of theoptic axes increases or diminishes with the less or greater distances ofobjects. All objects before or behind the place where this angle is formed,appear double; as any one may observe by holding up a pen between his eyesand the candle; when he looks attentively at a spot on the pen, andcarelessly at the candle, it will appear double; and the reverse when helooks attentively at the candle and carelessly at the pen; so that in thiscase the muscles of the eye, like those of the limbs, stagger and aredisobedient to the expiring efforts of volition. Numerous objects areindeed sometimes seen by the inebriate, occasioned by the refractions madeby the tears, which stand upon his eye-lids."|FALSE
15707|"8. This vertigo also continues, when the inebriate lies in his bed, in thedark, or with his eyes closed; and this more powerfully than when he iserect, and in the light. For the irritative ideas of the apparent motionsof objects are now excited by irritation from internal stimulus, or byassociation with other irritative motions; and the inebriate, like one in adream, believes the objects of these irritative motions to be present, andfeels himself vertiginous. I have observed in this situation, so long as myeyes and mind were intent upon a book, the sickness and vertigo ceased, andwere renewed again the moment I discontinued this attention; as wasexplained in the preceding account of sea-sickness. Some drunken peoplehave been known to become sober instantly from some accident, that hasstrongly excited their attention, as the pain of a broken bone, or the newsof their house being on fire."|FALSE
15707|"9. Sometimes the vertigo from internal causes, as from intoxication, or atthe beginning of some fevers, becomes so universal, that the irritativemotions which belong to other organs of sense are succeeded by sensation orattention, as well as those of the eye. The vertiginous noise in the earshas been explained in Section XX. on Vertigo. The taste of the saliva,which in general is not attended to, becomes perceptible, and the patientscomplain of a bad taste in their mouth."|FALSE
15707|"The common smells of the surrounding air sometimes excite the attention ofthese patients, and bad smells are complained of, which to other people areimperceptible.

The irritative motions belonging tothe senses of distention, and of heat, like those above mentioned, becomeattended to at this time: hence we feel the pulsation of our arteries allover us, and complain of heat, or of cold, in parts of the body where thereis no accumulation or diminution of actual heat. All which are to beexplained, as in the last paragraph, by the irritative ideas belonging tothe various senses being now excited by internal stimuli, or by theirassociations with other irritative motions. And that the inebriate, likeone in a dream, believes the external objects, which usually caused theseirritative ideas, to be now present."|FALSE
15707|"10. The diseases in consequence of frequent inebriety, or of daily takingmuch vinous spirit without inebriety, consist in the paralysis, which isliable to succeed violent stimulation. Organs, whose actions are associatedwith others, are frequently more affected than the organ, which isstimulated into too violent action. See Sect. XXIV. 2. 8. Hence in drunkenpeople it generally happens, that the secretory vessels of the liver becomefirst paralytic, and a torpor with consequent gall-stones or schirrus ofthis viscus is induced with concomitant jaundice; otherwise it becomesinflamed in consequence of previous torpor, and this inflammation isfrequently transferred to a more sensible part, which is associated withit, and produces the gout, or the rosy eruption of the face, or some otherleprous eruption on the head, or arms, or legs. Sometimes the stomach isfirst affected, and paralysis of the lacteal system is induced: whence atotal abhorrence from flesh-food, and general emaciation. In others thelymphatic system is affected with paralysis, and dropsy is the consequence.In some inebriates the torpor of the liver produces pain without apparentschirrus, or gall stones, or inflammation, or consequent gout, and in theseepilepsy or insanity are often the consequence. All which will be morefully treated of in the course of the work."|FALSE
15707|"I am well aware, that it is a common opinion, that the gout is asfrequently owing to gluttony in eating, as to intemperance in drinkingfermented or spirituous liquors. To this I answer, that I have seen noperson afflicted with the gout, who has not drank freely of fermentedliquor, as wine and water, or small beer; though as the disposition to allthe diseases, which have originated from intoxication, is in some degreehereditary, a less quantity of spirituous potation will induce the gout inthose, who inherit the disposition from their parents.

This is well known in the distilleries, wherethe swine, which are fattened by the spirituous sediments of barrels,acquire diseased livers. But mark what happens to a man, who drinks a quartof wine or of ale, if he has not been habituated to it. He loses the useboth of his limbs and of his understanding! He becomes a temporary idiot,and has a temporary stroke of the palsy! And though he slowly recoversafter some hours, is it not reasonable to conclude, that a perpetualrepetition of so powerful a poison must at length permanently affecthim?--If a person accidentally becomes intoxicated by eating a fewmushrooms of a peculiar kind, a general alarm is excited, and he is said tobe poisoned, and emetics are exhibited; but so familiarised are we to theintoxication from vinous spirit, that it occasions laughter rather thanalarm."|FALSE

Thus the thickness of the optic nerves, where theyenter the eye, and the great expansion of the nerves of touch beneath thewhole of the cuticle, evince the great consumption of sensorial power bythese senses. And our perpetual muscular actions in the common offices oflife, and in constantly preserving the perpendicularity of our bodiesduring the day, evince a considerable expenditure of the spirit ofanimation by our locomotive muscles. It follows, that if the exertion ofthese organs of sense and muscles be for a while intermitted, that somequantity of sensorial power must be accumulated, and a propensity toactivity of some kind ensue from the increased excitability of the system.Whence proceeds the irksomeness of a continued attitude, and of an indolentlife."|FALSE

To the facilityand distinctness, with which we hear sounds at repeated intervals, we owethe pleasure, which we receive from musical time, and from poetic time; asdescribed in Botanic Garden, P. 2.

In common time thereis a division between every two crotchets, or other notes of equivalenttime; though the bar in written music is put after every fourth crotchet,or notes equivalent in time; in triple time the division or bar is afterevery three crotchets, or notes equivalent; so that in common time therepetition recurs more frequently than in triple time.

15707|"III. 1. Man is termed by Aristotle an imitative animal; this propensity toimitation not only appears in the actions of children, but in all thecustoms and fashions of the world: many thousands tread in the beaten pathsof others, for one who traverses regions of his own discovery. The originof this propensity of imitation has not, that I recollect, been deducedfrom any known principle; when any action presents itself to the view of achild, as of whetting a knife, or threading a needle, the parts of thisaction in respect of time, motion, figure, is imitated by a part of theretina of his eye; to perform this action therefore with his hands iseasier to him than to invent any new action, because it consists inrepeating with another set of fibres, viz. with the moving muscles, what hehad just performed by some parts of the retina; just as in dancing wetransfer the times of motion from the actions of the auditory nerves to themuscles of the limbs. Imitation therefore consists of repetition, which wehave shewn above to be the easiest kind of animal action, and which weperpetually fall into, when we possess an accumulation of sensorial power,which is not otherwise called into exertion."|FALSE

Asexplained in Sect. XIV. 2. 2. Hence it appears, that our perceptionsthemselves are copies, that is, imitations of some properties of externalmatter; and the propensity to imitation is thus interwoven with ourexistence, as it is produced by the stimuli of external bodies, and isafterwards repeated by our volitions and sensations, and thus constitutesall the operations of our minds."|FALSE
15707|"2. Imitations resolve themselves into four kinds, voluntary, sensitive,irritative, and associate. The voluntary imitations are, when we imitatedeliberately the actions of others, either by mimicry, as in acting a play,or in delineating a flower; or in the common actions of our lives, as inour dress, cookery, language, manners, and even in our habits of thinking."|FALSE

Thus many young men on seeing cruel surgical operations become sick,and some even feel pain in the parts of their own bodies, which they seetortured or wounded in others; that is, they in some measure imitate by theexertions of their own fibres the violent actions, which they witnessed inthose of others. In this case a double imitation takes place, first theobserver imitates with the extremities of the optic nerve the mangledlimbs, which are present before his eyes; then by a second imitation heexcites to violent action of the fibres of his own limbs as to produce painin those parts of his own body, which he saw wounded in another.

Of these are the productionof matter by the membranes of the fauces, or by the skin, in consequence ofthe venereal disease previously affecting the parts of generation. Since asno fever is excited, and as neither the blood of such patients, nor eventhe matter from ulcers of the throat, or from cutaneous ulcers, will byinoculation produce the venereal disease in others, as observed by Mr.Hunter, there is reason to conclude, that no contagious matter is conveyedthither by the blood-vessels, but that a milder matter is formed by theactions of the fine vessels in those membranes imitating each other. SeeSection XXXIII. 2. 9. In this disease the actions of these vesselsproducing ulcers on the throat and skin are imperfect imitations of thoseproducing chanker, or gonorrhoea; since the matter produced by them is notinfectious, while the imitative actions in the hydrophobia appear to beperfect resemblances, as they produce a material equally infectious withthe original one, which induced them."|FALSE
15707|"The contagion from the bite of a mad dog differs from other contagiousmaterials, from its being communicable from other animals to mankind, andfrom many animals to each other; the phenomena attending the hydrophobiaare in some degree explicable on the foregoing theory. The infectiousmatter does not appear to enter the circulation, as it cannot be tracedalong the course of the lymphatics from the wound, nor is there anyswelling of the lymphatic glands, nor does any fever attend, as occurs inthe small-pox, and in many other contagious diseases; yet by some unknownprocess the disease is communicated from the wound to the throat, and thatmany months after the injury, so as to produce pain and hydrophobia, with asecretion of infectious saliva of the same kind, as that of the mad dog,which inflicted the wound."|FALSE
15707|"This subject is very intricate.--It would appear, that by certain morbidactions of the salivary glands of the mad dog, a peculiar kind of saliva isproduced; which being instilled into a wound of another animal stimulatesthe cutaneous or mucous glands into morbid actions, but which areineffectual in respect to the production of a similar contagious material;but the salivary glands by irritative sympathy are thrown into similaraction, and produce an infectious saliva similar to that instilled into thewound."|FALSE

Of this kind was the contagious matter, which producedthe jail-fever at the assizes at Oxford about a century ago. Which, thoughfatal to so many, was not communicated to their nurses or attendants. Inthese cases, the imitations of the fine vessels, as above described, appearto be imperfect, and do not therefore produce a matter similar to that,which stimulates them; in this circumstance resembling the venereal matterin ulcers of the throat or skin, according to the curious discovery of Mr.Hunter above related, who found, by repeated inoculations, that it wouldnot infect.

15707|"Another example of morbid imitation is in the production of a greatquantity of contagious matter, as in the inoculated small-pox, from a smallquantity of it inserted into the arm, and probably diffused in the blood.These particles of contagious matter stimulate the extremities of the finearteries of the skin, and cause them to imitate some properties of thoseparticles of contagious matter, so as to produce a thousandfold of asimilar material.

This extraneous power in respect to the heart is the currentof blood, which is perpetually absorbed by the veins from the variousglands and capillaries, and pushed into the heart by a power probably verysimilar to that, which raises the sap in vegetables in the spring, which,according to Dr. Hale's experiment on the stump of a vine, exerted a forceequal to a column of water above twenty feet high. This force of thecurrent of blood in the veins is partly produced by their absorbent power,exerted at the beginning of every fine ramification; which may be conceivedto be a mouth absorbing blood, as the mouths of the lacteals and lymphaticsabsorb chyle and lymph. And partly by their intermitted compression by thepulsations of their generally concomitant arteries; by which the blood isperpetually propelled towards the heart, as the valves in many veins, andthe absorbent mouths in them all, will not suffer it to return."|FALSE

The powernecessary to do this in so short a time must be considerable, and has beenvariously estimated by different physiologists."|FALSE

15707|"In the vessels of the liver there is no intervention of the heart; but thevena portarum, which does the office of an artery, is distended by theblood poured into it from the mesenteric veins, and is by this distentionstimulated to contract itself, and propel the blood to the mouths of thenumerous glands, which compose that viscus."|FALSE
15707|"II. The glandular system of vessels may be divided into those, which takesome fluid from the circulation; and those, which give something to it.Those, which take their fluid from the circulation are the various glands,by which the tears, bile, urine, perspiration, and many other secretionsare produced; these glands probably consist of a mouth to select, a bellyto digest, and an excretory aperture to emit their appropriated fluids; theblood is conveyed by the power of the heart and arteries to the mouths ofthese glands, it is there taken up by the living power of the gland, andcarried forwards to its belly, and excretory aperture, where a part isseparated, and the remainder absorbed by the veins for further purposes."|FALSE
15707|"Some of these glands are furnished with long convoluted necks or tubes, asthe seminal ones, which are curiously seen when injected with quicksilver.Others seem to consist of shorter tubes, as that great congeries of glands,which constitute the liver, and those of the kidneys. Some have theirexcretory apertures opening into reservoirs, as the urinary andgall-bladders. And others on the external body, as those which secrete thetears, and perspirable matter."|FALSE
15707|"Another great system of glands, which have very short necks, are thecapillary vessels; by which the insensible perspiration is secreted on theskin; and the mucus of various consistences, which lubricates theinterstices of the cellular membrane, of the muscular fibres, and of allthe larger cavities of the body. From the want of a long convolution ofvessels some have doubted, whether these capillaries should be consideredas glands, and have been led to conclude, that the perspirable matterrather exuded than was secreted. But the fluid of perspiration is notsimple water, though that part of it, which exhales into the air may besuch; for there is another part of it, which in a state of health isabsorbed again; but which, when the absorbents are diseased, remains on thesurface of the skin, in the form of scurf, or indurated mucus. Anotherthing, which shews their similitude to other glands, is their sensibilityto certain affections of the mind; as is seen in the deeper colour of theskin in the blush of shame, or the greater paleness of it from fear."|FALSE
15707|"III. Another series of glandular vessels is called the absorbent system;these open their mouths into all the cavities, and upon all those surfacesof the body, where the excretory apertures of the other glands pour outtheir fluids. The mouths of the absorbent system drink up a part or thewhole of these fluids, and carry them forwards by their living power totheir respective glands, which are called conglobate glands. There thesefluids undergo some change, before they pass on into the circulation; butif they are very acrid, the conglobate gland swells, and sometimessuppurates, as in inoculation of the small-pox, in the plague, and invenereal absorptions; at other times the fluid may perhaps continue there,till it undergoes some chemical change, that renders it less noxious; or,what is more likely, till it is regurgitated by the retrograde motion ofthe gland in spontaneous sweats or diarrhoeas, as disagreeing food isvomited from the stomach."|FALSE
15707|"IV. As all the fluids, that pass through these glands, and capillaryvessels, undergo a chemical change, acquiring new combinations, the matterof heat is at the same time given out; this is apparent, since whateverincreases insensible perspiration, increases the heat of the skin; and whenthe action of these vessels is much increased but for a moment, as inblushing, a vivid heat on the skin is the immediate consequence. So whengreat bilious secretions, or those of any other gland, are produced, heatis generated in the part in proportion to the quantity of the secretion."|FALSE
15707|"The heat produced on the skin by blushing may be thought by some too suddento be pronounced a chemical effect, as the fermentations or newcombinations taking place in a fluid is in general a slower process. Yetare there many chemical mixtures in which heat is given out asinstantaneously; as in solutions of metals in acids, or in mixtures ofessential oils and acids, as of oil of cloves and acid of nitre. So thebruised parts of an unripe apple become almost instantaneously sweet; andif the chemico-animal process of digestion be stopped for but a moment, asby fear, or even by voluntary eructation, a great quantity of air isgenerated, by the fermentation, which instantly succeeds the stop ofdigestion. By the experiments of Dr. Hales it appears, that an apple duringfermentation gave up above six hundred times its bulk of air; and thematerials in the stomach are such, and in such a situation, as immediatelyto run into fermentation, when digestion is impeded."|FALSE
15707|"As the blood passes through the small vessels of the lungs, which connectthe pulmonary artery and vein, it undergoes a change of colour from a darkto a light red; which may be termed a chemical change, as it is known to beeffected by an admixture of oxygene, or vital air; which, according to adiscovery of Dr. Priestley, passes through the moist membranes, whichconstitute the sides of these vessels. As the blood passes through thecapillary vessels, and glands, which connect the aorta and its variousbranches with their correspondent veins in the extremities of the body, itagain loses the bright red colour, and undergoes some new combinations inthe glands or capillaries, in which the matter of heat is given out fromthe secreted fluids. This process therefore, as well as the process ofrespiration, has some analogy to combustion, as the vital air or oxygeneseems to become united to some inflammable base, and the matter of heatescapes from the new acid, which is thus produced."|FALSE
15707|"V. After the blood has passed these glands and capillaries, and parted withwhatever they chose to take from it, the remainder is received by theveins, which are a set of blood-absorbing vessels in general correspondingwith the ramifications of the arterial system. At the extremity of the fineconvolutions of the glands the arterial force ceases; this in respect tothe capillary vessels, which unite the extremities of the arteries with thecommencement of the veins, is evident to the eye, on viewing the tail of atadpole by means of a solar, or even by a common microscope, for globulesof blood are seen to endeavour to pass, and to return again and again,before they become absorbed by the mouths of the veins; which returning ofthese globules evinces, that the arterial force behind them has ceased. Theveins are furnished with valves like the lymphatic absorbents; and thegreat trunks of the veins, and of the lacteals and lymphatics, jointogether before the ingress of their fluids into the left chamber of theheart; both which evince, that the blood in the veins, and the lymph andchyle in the lacteals and lymphatics, are carried on by a similar force;otherwise the stream, which was propelled with a less power, could notenter the vessels, which contained the stream propelled with a greaterpower. From whence it appears, that the veins are a system of vesselsabsorbing blood, as the lacteals and lymphatics are a system of vesselsabsorbing chyle and lymph. See Sect. XXVII. 1."|FALSE
15707|"VI. The movements of their adapted fluids in the various vessels of thebody are carried forwards by the actions of those vessels in consequence oftwo kinds of stimulus, one of which may be compared to a pleasurablesensation or desire inducing the vessel to seize, and, as it were, toswallow the particles thus selected from the blood; as is done by themouths of the various glands, veins, and other absorbents, which may becalled glandular appetency. The other kind of stimulus may be compared todisagreeable sensation, or aversion, as when the heart has received theblood, and is stimulated by it to push it forwards into the arteries; thesame again stimulates the arteries to contract, and carry forwards theblood to their extremities, the glands and capillaries. Thus the mesentericveins absorb the blood from the intestines by glandular appetency, andcarry it forward to the vena portarum; which acting as an artery contractsitself by disagreeable stimulus, and pushes it to its ramified extremities,the various glands, which constitute the liver."|FALSE

15707|"1. As the saliva secreted by these glands is most wanted during themastication of our food, it happens, when the terminations of their ductsin the mouth are stimulated into action, the salival glands themselves arebrought into increased action at the same time by association, and separatea greater quantity of their juices from the blood; in the same manner astears are produced in greater abundance during the stimulus of the vapourof onions, or of any other acrid material in the eye."|FALSE
15707|"The saliva is thus naturally poured into the mouth only during the stimulusof our food in mastication; for when there is too great an exhalation ofthe mucilaginous secretion from the membranes, which line the mouth, or toogreat an absorption of it, the mouth becomes dry, though there is nodeficiency in the quantity of saliva; as in those who sleep with theirmouths open, and in some fevers."|FALSE
15707|"2. Though during the mastication of our natural food the salival glands areexcited into action by the stimulus on their excretory ducts, and a duequantity of saliva is separated from the blood, and poured into the mouth;yet as this mastication of our food is always attended with a degree ofpleasure; and that pleasurable sensation is also connected with our ideasof certain kinds of aliment; it follows, that when these ideas arereproduced, the pleasurable sensation arises along with them, and thesalival glands are excited into action, and fill the mouth with saliva fromthis sensitive association, as is frequently seen in dogs, who slaver atthe sight of food."|FALSE

If any very acrid material be held in the mouth, as the root ofpyrethrum, or the leaves of tobacco, the salival glands are stimulated intostronger action than is natural, and thence secrete a much larger quantityof saliva; which is at the same time more viscid than in its natural state;because the lymphatics, that open their mouths into the ducts of thesalival glands, and on the membranes, which line the mouth, are likewisestimulated into stronger action, and absorb the more liquid parts of thesaliva with greater avidity; and the remainder is left both in greaterquantity and more viscid."|FALSE

15707|"As the extremities of the glands are of exquisite tenuity, as appears bytheir difficulty of injection, it was necessary for them to secrete theirfluids in a very dilute state; and, probably for the purpose of stimulatingthem into action, a quantity of neutral salt is likewise secreted or formedby the gland. This aqueous and saline part of all secreted fluids is againreabsorbed into the habit. More than half of some secreted fluids is thusimbibed from the reservoirs, into which they are poured; as in the urinarybladder much more than half of what is secreted by the kidneys becomesreabsorbed by the lymphatics, which are thickly dispersed around the neckof the bladder. This seems to be the purpose of the urinary bladders offish, as otherwise such a receptacle for the urine could have been of nouse to an animal immersed in water."|FALSE

15707|"6. When disagreeable food in the stomach produces nausea, a flow of salivais excited in the mouth by association; as efforts to vomit are frequentlyproduced by disagreeable drugs in the mouth by the same kind ofassociation."|FALSE
15707|"7. A preternatural flow of saliva is likewise sometimes occasioned by adisease of the voluntary power; for if we think about our saliva, anddetermine not to swallow it, or not to spit it out, an exertion is producedby the will, and more saliva is secreted against our wish; that is, by ouraversion, which bears the same analogy to desire, as pain does to pleasure;as they are only modifications of the same disposition of the sensorium.See Class IV. 3. 2. 1."|FALSE

15707|"Thus when any extraneous material on the eye-ball, or the dryness of theexternal covering of it, or the coldness of the air, or the acrimony ofsome vapours, as of onions, stimulates the excretory duct of the lacrymalgland, it discharges its contents upon the ball; a quicker secretion takesplace in the gland, and abundant tears succeed, to moisten, clean, andlubricate the eye. These by frequent nictitation are diffused over thewhole ball, and as the external angle of the eye in winking is closedsooner than the internal angle, the tears are gradually driven forwards,and downwards from the lacrymal gland to the puncta lacrymalia."|FALSE

As the tears are brought to the internal angle of the eye,these two mouths drink them up, being stimulated into action by this fluid,which they absorb. The belly of the gland, or lacrymal sack, is thusfilled, in which the saline part of the tears is absorbed, and when theother end of the gland, or nasal duct, is stimulated by the dryness, orpained by the coldness of the air, or affected by any acrimonious dust orvapour in the nostrils, it is excited into action together with the sack,and the tears are disgorged upon the membrane, which lines the nostrils;where they serve a second purpose to moisten, clean, and lubricate, theorgan of smell."|FALSE

When the nasal duct of this gland is stimulated by any very acridmaterial, as the powder of tobacco, or volatile spirits, it not onlydisgorges the contents of its belly or receptacle (the lacrymal sack), andabsorbs hastily all the fluid, that is ready for it in the corner of theeye; but by the association of its motions with those of the lacrymalgland, it excites that also into increased action, and a large flow oftears is poured into the eye."|FALSE
15707|"5. This nasal duct is likewise excited into strong action by sensitiveideas, as in grief, or joy, and then also by its associations with thelacrymal gland it produces a great flow of tears without any externalstimulus; as is more fully explained in Sect. XVI. 8. on Instinct."|FALSE
15707|"6. There are some, famous in the arts of exciting compassion, who are saidto have acquired a voluntary power of producing a flow of tears in the eye;which, from what has been said in the section on Instinct above mentioned,I should suspect, is performed by acquiring a voluntary power over theaction of this nasal duct."|FALSE
15707|"7. There is another circumstance well worthy our attention, that when byany accident this nasal duct is obstructed, the lacrymal sack, which is thebelly or receptacle of this gland, by slight pressure of the finger isenabled to disgorge its contents again into the eye; perhaps the bile inthe same manner, when the biliary ducts are obstructed, is returned intothe blood by the vessels which secrete it?"|FALSE
15707|"8. A very important though minute occurrence must here be observed, thatthough the lacrymal gland is only excited into action, when we weep at adistressful tale, by its association with this nasal duct, as is more fullyexplained in Sect. XVI. 8; yet the quantity of tears secreted at once ismore than the puncta lacrymalia can readily absorb; which shews _that themotions occasioned by associations are frequently more energetic than theoriginal motions, by which they were occasioned_. Which we shall haveoccasion to mention hereafter, to illustrate, why pains frequently exist ina part distant from the cause of them, as in the other end of the urethra,when a stone stimulates the neck of the bladder. And why inflammationsfrequently arise in parts distant from their cause, as the gutta rosea ofdrinking people, from an inflamed liver."|FALSE
15707|"The inflammation of a part is generally preceded by a torpor or quiescenceof it; if this exists in any large congeries of glands, as in the liver, orany membranous part, as the stomach, pain is produced and chilliness inconsequence of the torpor of the vessels. In this situation sometimes aninflammation of the parts succeeds the torpor; at other times a distantmore sensible part becomes inflamed; whose actions have previously beenassociated with it; and the torpor of the first part ceases. This Iapprehend happens, when the gout of the foot succeeds a pain of the biliaryduct, or of the stomach. Lastly, it sometimes happens, that the pain oftorpor exists without any consequent inflammation of the affected part, orof any distant part associated with it, as in the membranes about thetemple and eye-brows in hemicrania, and in those pains, which occasionconvulsions; if this happens to gouty people, when it affects the liver, Isuppose epileptic fits are produced; and, when it affects the stomach,death is the consequence. In these cases the pulse is weak, and theextremities cold, and such medicines as stimulate the quiescent parts intoaction, or which induce inflammation in them, or in any distant part, whichis associated with them, cures the present pain of torpor, and saves thepatient."|FALSE
15707|"I have twice seen a gouty inflammation of the liver, attended withjaundice; the patients after a few days were both of them affected withcold fits, like ague-fits, and their feet became affected with gout, andthe inflammation of their livers ceased. It is probable, that the uneasysensations about the stomach, and indigestion, which precedes goutyparoxysms, are generally owing to torpor or slight inflammation of theliver, and biliary ducts; but where great pain with continued sickness,with feeble pulse, and sensation of cold, affect the stomach in patientsdebilitated by the gout, that it is a torpor of the stomach itself, anddestroys the patient from the great connexion of that viscus with the vitalorgans.

15707|"1. The throat, stomach, and intestines, may be considered as one greatgland; which like the lacrymal sack above mentioned, neither begins norends in the circulation. Though the act of masticating our aliment belongsto the sensitive class of motions, for the pleasure of its taste inducesthe muscles of the jaw into action; yet the deglutition of it whenmasticated is generally, if not always, an irritative motion, occasioned bythe application of the food already masticated to the origin of thepharinx; in the same manner as we often swallow our spittle withoutattending to it."|FALSE
15707|"The ruminating class of animals have the power to invert the motion oftheir gullet, and of their first stomach, from the stimulus of thisaliment, when it is a little further prepared; as is their daily practicein chewing the cud; and appears to the eye of any one, who attends to them,whilst they are employed in this second mastication of their food."|FALSE
15707|"2. When our natural aliment arrives into the stomach, this organ issimulated into its proper vermicular action; which beginning at the upperorifice of it, and terminating at the lower one, gradually mixes togetherand pushes forwards the digesting materials into the intestine beneath it."|FALSE
15707|"At the same time the glands, that supply the gastric juices, which arenecessary to promote the chemical part of the process of digestion, arestimulated to discharge their contained fluids, and to separate a furthersupply from the blood-vessels: and the lacteals or lymphatics, which opentheir mouths into the stomach, are stimulated into action, and take up somepart of the digesting materials."|FALSE
15707|"3. The remainder of these digesting materials is carried forwards into theupper intestines, and stimulates them into their peristaltic motion similarto that of the stomach; which continues gradually to mix the changingmaterials, and pass them along through the valve of the colon to theexcretory end of this great gland, the sphincter ani."|FALSE
15707|"The digesting materials produce a flow of bile, and of pancreatic juice, asthey pass along the duodenum, by stimulating the excretory ducts of theliver and pancreas, which terminate in that intestine: and other branchesof the absorbent or lymphatic system, called lacteals, are excited to drinkup, as it passes, those parts of the digesting materials, that are properfor their purpose, by its stimulus on their mouths."|FALSE
15707|"4. When the stomach and intestines are thus filled with their proper food,not only the motions of the gastric glands, the pancreas, liver, andlacteal vessels, are excited into action; but at the same time the wholetribe of irritative motions are exerted with greater energy, a greaterdegree of warmth, colour, plumpness, and moisture, is given to the skinfrom the increased action of those glands called capillary vessels;pleasurable sensation is excited, the voluntary motions are less easilyexerted, and at length suspended; and sleep succeeds, unless it beprevented by the stimulus of surrounding objects, or by voluntary exertion,or by an acquired habit, which was originally produced by one or other ofthese circumstances, as is explained in Sect. XXI. on Drunkenness."|FALSE
15707|"At this time also, as the blood-vessels become replete with chyle, moreurine is separated into the bladder, and less of it is reabsorbed; moremucus poured into the cellular membranes, and less of it reabsorbed; thepulse becomes fuller, and softer, and in general quicker. The reason whyless urine and cellular mucus is absorbed after a full meal with sufficientdrink is owing to the blood-vessels being fuller: hence one means topromote absorption is to decrease the resistance by emptying the vessels byvenesection. From this decreased absorption the urine becomes pale as wellas copious, and the skin appears plump as well as florid."|FALSE
15707|"By daily repetition of these movements they all become connected together,and make a diurnal circle of irritative action, and if one of this chain bedisturbed, the whole is liable to be put into disorder. See Sect. XX. onVertigo."|FALSE

When the stomach and intestines receive a quantity of food, whosestimulus is greater than usual, all their motions, and those of the glandsand lymphatics, are stimulated into stronger action than usual, and performtheir offices with greater vigour and in less time: such are the effects ofcertain quantities of spice or of vinous spirit."|FALSE
15707|"6. But if the quantity or duration of these stimuli are still furtherincreased, the stomach and throat are stimulated into a motion, whosedirection is contrary to the natural one above described; and theyregurgitate the materials, which they contain, instead of carrying themforwards. This retrograde motion of the stomach may be compared to thestretchings of wearied limbs the contrary way, and is well elucidated bythe following experiment. Look earnestly for a minute or two on an area aninch square of pink silk, placed in a strong light, the eye becomesfatigued, the colour becomes faint, and at length vanishes, for thefatigued eye can no longer be stimulated into direct motions; then onclosing the eye a green spectrum will appear in it, which is a colourdirectly contrary to pink, and which will appear and disappear repeatedly,like the efforts in vomiting. See Section XXIX. 11."|FALSE
15707|"Hence all those drugs, which by their bitter or astringent stimulusincrease the action of the stomach, as camomile and white vitriol, if theirquantity is increased above a certain dose become emetics."|FALSE
15707|"These inverted motions of the stomach and throat are generally producedfrom the stimulus of unnatural food, and are attended with the sensation ofnausea or sickness: but as this sensation is again connected with an ideaof the distasteful food, which induced it; so an idea of nauseous food willalso sometimes excite the action of nausea; and that give rise byassociation to the inversion of the motions of the stomach and throat. Assome, who have had horse-flesh or dogs-flesh given them for beef or mutton,are said to have vomited many hours afterwards, when they have been told ofthe imposition."|FALSE
15707|"I have been told of a person, who had gained a voluntary command over theseinverted motions of the stomach and throat, and supported himself byexhibiting this curiosity to the public. At these exhibitions he swalloweda pint of red rough gooseberries, and a pint of white smooth ones, broughtthem up in small parcels into his mouth, and restored them separately tothe spectators, who called for red or white as they pleased, till the wholewere redelivered."|FALSE
15707|"7. At the same time that these motions of the stomach and throat arestimulated into inversion, some of the other irritative motions, that hadacquired more immediate connexions with the stomach, as those of thegastric glands, are excited into stronger action by this association; andsome other of these motions, which are more easily excited, as those of thegastric lymphatics, are inverted by their association with the retrogrademotions of the stomach, and regurgitate their contents, and thus a greaterquantity of mucus, and of lymph, or chyle, is poured into the stomach, andthrown up along with its contents."|FALSE
15707|"8. These inversions of the motion of the stomach in vomiting are performedby intervals, for the same reason that many other motions are reciprocallyexerted and relaxed; for during the time of exertion the stimulus, orsensation, which caused this exertion, is not perceived; but begins to beperceived again, as soon as the exertion ceases, and is some time in againproducing its effect. As explained in Sect. XXXIV. on Volition, where it isshewn, that the contractions of the fibres, and the sensation of pain,which occasioned that exertion, cannot exist at the same time. The exertionceases from another cause also, which is the exhaustion of the sensorialpower of the part, and these two causes frequently operate together."|FALSE
15707|"9. At the times of these inverted efforts of the stomach not only thelymphatics, which open their mouths into the stomach, but those of the skinalso, are for a time inverted; for sweats are sometimes pushed out duringthe efforts of vomiting without an increase of heat."|FALSE
15707|"10. But if by a greater stimulus the motions of the stomach are invertedstill more violently or more permanently, the duodenum has its peristalticmotions inverted at the same time by their association with those of thestomach; and the bile and pancreatic juice, which it contains, are by theinverted motions brought up into the stomach, and discharged along with itscontents; while a greater quantity of bile and pancreatic juice is pouredinto this intestine; as the glands, that secrete them, are by theirassociation with the motions of the intestine excited into stronger actionthan usual."|FALSE
15707|"11. The other intestines are by association excited into more powerfulaction, while the lymphatics, that open their mouths into them, suffer aninversion of their motions corresponding with the lymphatics of thestomach, and duodenum; which with a part of the abundant secretion of bileis carried downwards, and contributes both to stimulate the bowels, and toincrease the quantity of the evacuations. This inversion of the motion ofthe lymphatics appears from the quantity of chyle, which comes away bystools; which is otherwise absorbed as soon as produced, and by the immensequantity of thin fluid, which is evacuated along with it."|FALSE
15707|"12. But if the stimulus, which inverts the stomach, be still more powerful,or more permanent, it sometimes happens, that the motions of the biliaryglands, and of their excretory ducts, are at the same time inverted, andregurgitate their contained bile into the blood-vessels, as appears by theyellow colour of the skin, and of the urine; and it is probable thepancreatic secretion may suffer an inversion at the same time, though wehave yet no mark by which this can be ascertained."|FALSE
15707|"13. Mr. ---- eat two putrid pigeons out of a cold pigeon-pye, and drankabout a pint of beer and ale along with them, and immediately rode aboutfive miles. He was then seized with vomiting, which was after a few periodssucceeded by purging; these continued alternately for two hours; and thepurging continued by intervals for six or eight hours longer. During thistime he could not force himself to drink more than one pint in the whole;this great inability to drink was owing to the nausea, or inverted motionsof the stomach, which the voluntary exertion of swallowing could seldom andwith difficulty overcome; yet he discharged in the whole at least sixquarts; whence came this quantity of liquid? First, the contents of thestomach were emitted, then of the duodenum, gall-bladder, and pancreas, byvomiting. After this the contents of the lower bowels, then the chyle, thatwas in the lacteal vessels, and in the receptacle of chyle, wasregurgitated into the intestines by a retrograde motion of these vessels.And afterwards the mucus deposited in the cellular membrane, and on thesurface of all the other membranes, seems to have been absorbed; and withthe fluid absorbed from the air to have been carried up their respectivelymphatic branches by the increased energy of their natural motions, anddown the visceral lymphatics, or lacteals, by the inversion of theirmotions."|FALSE
15707|"14. It may be difficult to invent experiments to demonstrate the truth ofthis inversion of some branches of the absorbent system, and increasedabsorption of others, but the analogy of these vessels to the intestinalcanal, and the symptoms of many diseases, render this opinion more probablethan many other received opinions of the animal oeconomy."|FALSE
15707|"In the above instance, after the yellow excrement was voided, the fluidceased to have any smell, and appeared like curdled milk, and then athinner fluid, and some mucus, were evacuated; did not these seem topartake of the chyle, of the mucous fluid from all the cells of the body,and lastly, of the atmospheric moisture? All these facts may be easilyobserved by any one, who takes a brisk purge."|FALSE
15707|"15. Where the stimulus on the stomach, or on some other part of theintestinal canal, is still more permanent, not only the lacteal vessels,but the whole canal itself, becomes inverted from its associations: this isthe iliac passion, in which all the fluids mentioned above are thrown up bythe mouth. At this time the valve in the colon, from the inverted motionsof that bowel, and the inverted action of this living valve, does notprevent the regurgitation of its contents."|FALSE
15707|"The structure of this valve may be represented by a flexile leathern pipestanding up from the bottom of a vessel of water: its sides collapse by thepressure of the ambient fluid, as a small part of that fluid passes throughit; but if it has a living power, and by its inverted action keeps itselfopen, it becomes like a rigid pipe, and will admit the whole liquid topass. See Sect. XXIX. 2. 5."|FALSE
15707|"In this case the patient is averse to drink, from the constant inversion ofthe motions of the stomach, and yet many quarts are daily ejected from thestomach, which at length smell of excrement, and at last seem to be only athin mucilaginous or aqueous liquor."|FALSE
15707|"From whence is it possible, that this great quantity of fluid for manysuccessive days can be supplied, after the cells of the body have given uptheir fluids, but from the atmosphere? When the cutaneous branch ofabsorbents acts with unnatural strength, it is probable the intestinalbranch has its motions inverted, and thus a fluid is supplied withoutentering the arterial system. Could oiling or painting the skin give acheck to this disease?"|FALSE
15707|"So when the stomach has its motions inverted, the lymphatics of thestomach, which are most strictly associated with it, invert their motionsat the same time. But the more distant branches of lymphatics, which areless strictly associated with it, act with increased energy; as thecutaneous lymphatics in the cholera, or iliac passion, above described. Andother irritative motions become decreased, as the pulsations of thearteries, from the extra-derivation or exhaustion of the sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"Sometimes when stronger vomiting takes place the more distant branches ofthe lymphatic system invert their motions with those of the stomach, andloose stools are produced, and cold sweats."|FALSE
15707|"So when the lacteals have their motions inverted, as during the operationof strong purges, the urinary and cutaneous absorbents have their motionsincreased to supply the want of fluid in the blood, as in great thirst; butafter a meal with sufficient potation the urine is pale, that is, theurinary absorbents act weakly, no supply of water being wanted for theblood. And when the intestinal absorbents act too violently, as when toogreat quantities of fluid have been drank, the urinary absorbents inverttheir motions to carry off the superfluity, which is a new circumstance ofassociation, and a temporary diabetes supervenes."|FALSE
15707|"16. I have had the opportunity of seeing four patients in the iliacpassion, where the ejected material smelled and looked like excrement. Twoof these were so exhausted at the time I saw them, that more blood couldnot be taken from them, and as their pain had ceased, and they continued tovomit up every thing which they drank, I suspected that a mortification ofthe bowel had already taken place, and as they were both women advanced inlife, and a mortification is produced with less preceding pain in old andweak people, these both died. The other two, who were both young men, hadstill pain and strength sufficient for further venesection, and theyneither of them had any appearance of hernia, both recovered by repeatedbleeding, and a scruple of calomel given to one, and half a dram to theother, in very small pills: the usual means of clysters, and purges joinedwith opiates, had been in vain attempted. I have thought an ounce or two ofcrude mercury in less violent diseases of this kind has been of use, bycontributing to restore its natural motion to some part of the intestinalcanal, either by its weight or stimulus; and that hence the whole tuberecovered its usual associations of progressive peristaltic motion. I havein three cases seen crude mercury given in small doses, as one or twoounces twice a day, have great effect in stopping pertinacious vomitings."|FALSE
15707|"17. Besides the affections above described, the stomach is liable, likemany other membranes of the body, to torpor without consequentinflammation: as happens to the membranes about the head in some cases ofhemicrania, or in general head-ach. This torpor of the stomach is attendedwith indigestion, and consequent flatulency, and with pain, which isusually called the cramp of the stomach, and is relievable by aromatics,essential oils, alcohol, or opium."|FALSE
15707|"The intrusion of a gall-stone into the common bile-duct from thegall-bladder is sometimes mistaken for a pain of the stomach, as neither ofthem are attended with fever; but in the passage of a gall-stone, the painis confined to a less space, which is exactly where the common bile-ductenters the duodenum, as explained in Section XXX. 1. 3. Whereas in thisgastrodynia the pain is diffused over the whole stomach; and, like otherdiseases from torpor, the pulse is weaker, and the extremities colder, andthe general debility greater, than in the passage of a gall-stone; for inthe former the debility is the consequence of the pain, in the latter it isthe cause of it."|FALSE
15707|"Though the first fits of the gout, I believe, commence with a torpor of theliver; and the ball of the toe becomes inflamed instead of the membranes ofthe liver in consequence of this torpor, as a coryza or catarrh frequentlysucceeds a long exposure of the feet to cold, as in snow, or on a moistbrick-floor; yet in old or exhausted constitutions, which have been longhabituated to its attacks, it sometimes commences with a torpor of thestomach, and is transferable to every membrane of the body. When the goutbegins with torpor of the stomach, a painful sensation of cold occurs,which the patient compares to ice, with weak pulse, cold extremities, andsickness; this in its slighter degree is relievable by spice, wine, oropium; in its greater degree it is succeeded by sudden death, which isowing to the sympathy of the stomach with the heart, as explained below."|FALSE
15707|"If the stomach becomes inflamed in consequence of this gouty torpor of it,or in consequence of its sympathy with some other part, the danger is less.A sickness and vomiting continues many days, or even weeks, the stomachrejecting every thing stimulant, even opium or alcohol, together with muchviscid mucus; till the inflammation at length ceases, as happens when othermembranes, as those of the joints, are the seat of gouty inflammation; asobserved in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8."|FALSE
15707|"The sympathy, or association of motions, between those of the stomach andthose of the heart, are evinced in many diseases. First, many people areoccasionally affected with an intermission of their pulse for a few days,which then ceases again. In this case there is a stop of the motion of theheart, and at the same time a tendency to eructation from the stomach. Assoon as the patient feels a tendency to the intermission of the motion ofhis heart, if he voluntarily brings up wind from his stomach, the stop ofthe heart does not occur. From hence I conclude that the stop of digestionis the primary disease; and that air is instantly generated from thealiment, which begins to ferment, if the digestive process is impeded for amoment, (see Sect. XXIII. 4.); and that the stop of the heart is inconsequence of the association of the motions of these viscera, asexplained in Sect. XXXV. 1. 4.; but if the little air, which is instantlygenerated during the temporary torpor of the stomach, be evacuated, thedigestion recommences, and the temporary torpor of the heart does notfollow. One patient, whom I lately saw, and who had been five or six daysmuch troubled with this intermission of a pulsation of his heart, and whohad hemicrania with some fever, was immediately relieved from them all bylosing ten ounces of blood, which had what is termed an inflammatory cruston it."|FALSE
15707|"Another instance of this association between the motions of the stomach andheart is evinced by the exhibition of an over dose of foxglove, whichinduces an incessant vomiting, which is attended with very slow, andsometimes intermitting pulse.--Which continues in spite of the exhibitionof wine and opium for two or three days. To the same association must beascribed the weak pulse, which constantly attends the exhibition of emeticsduring their operation. And also the sudden deaths, which have beenoccasioned in boxing by a blow on the stomach; and lastly, the sudden deathof those, who have been long debilitated by the gout, from the torpor ofthe stomach.

15707|"2. This series of glands is of the most extensive use, as their excretoryducts open on the whole external skin forming its perspirative pores, andon the internal surfaces of every cavity of the body. Their secretion onthe skin is termed insensible perspiration, which in health is in partreabsorbed by the mouths of the lymphatics, and in part evaporated in theair; the secretion on the membranes, which line the larger cavities of thebody, which have external openings, as the mouth and intestinal canal, istermed mucus, but is not however coagulable by heat; and the secretion onthe membranes of those cavities of the body, which have no externalopenings, is called lymph or water, as in the cavities of the cellularmembrane, and of the abdomen; this lymph however is coagulable by the heatof boiling water. Some mucus nearly as viscid as the white of egg, whichwas discharged by stool, did not coagulate, though I evaporated it to onefourth of the quantity, nor did the aqueous and vitreous humours of asheep's eye coagulate by the like experiment: but the serosity from ananasarcous leg, and that from the abdomen of a dropsical person, and thecrystalline humour of a sheep's eye, coagulated in the same heat."|FALSE
15707|"3. When any of these capillary glands are stimulated into greaterirritative actions, than is natural, they secrete a more copious material;and as the mouths of the absorbent system, which open in their vicinity,are at the same time stimulated into greater action, the thinner and moresaline part of the secreted fluid is taken up again; and the remainder isnot only more copious but also more viscid than natural. This is more orless troublesome or noxious according to the importance of the functions ofthe part affected: on the skin and bronchiæ, where this secretion oughtnaturally to evaporate, it becomes so viscid as to adhere to the membrane;on the tongue it forms a pellicle, which can with difficulty be scrapedoff; produces the scurf on the heads of many people; and the mucus, whichis spit up by others in coughing. On the nostrils and fauces, when thesecretion of these capillary glands is increased, it is termed simplecatarrh; when in the intestines, a mucous diarrhoea; and in the urethra, orvagina, it has the name of gonorrhoea, or fluor albus."|FALSE

When these capillary glands become inflamed, a still more viscid or evencretaceous humour is produced upon the surfaces of the membranes, which isthe cause or the effect of rheumatism, gout, leprosy, and of hard tumoursof the legs, which are generally termed scorbutic; all which will betreated of hereafter."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The whole surface of the body, with all its cavities and contents,are covered with membrane. It lines every vessel, forms every cell, andbinds together all the muscular and perhaps the osseous fibres of the body;and is itself therefore probably a simpler substance than those fibres. Andas the containing vessels of the body from the largest to the least arethus lined and connected with membranes, it follows that these membranesthemselves consisted of unorganized materials."|FALSE
15707|"For however small we may conceive the diameters of the minutest vessels ofthe body, which escape our eyes and glasses, yet these vessels must consistof coats or sides, which are made up of an unorganized material, and whichare probably produced from a gluten, which hardens after its production,like the silk or web of caterpillars and spiders. Of this material consistthe membranes, which line the shells of eggs, and the shell itself, bothwhich are unorganized, and are formed from mucus, which hardens after it isformed, either by the absorption of its more fluid part, or by its unitingwith some part of the atmosphere. Such is also the production of the shellsof snails, and of shell-fish, and I suppose of the enamel of the teeth."|FALSE
15707|"2. But though the membranes, that compose the sides of the most minutevessels, are in truth unorganized materials, yet the larger membranes,which are perceptible to the eye, seem to be composed of an intertexture ofthe mouths of the absorbent system, and of the excretory ducts of thecapillaries, with their concomitant arteries, veins, and nerves: and fromthis construction it is evident, that these membranes must possess greatirritability to peculiar stimuli, though they are incapable of any motions,that are visible to the naked eye: and daily experience shews us, that intheir inflamed state they have the greatest sensibility to pain, as in thepleurisy and paronychia."|FALSE
15707|"3. On all these membranes a mucilaginous or aqueous fluid is secreted,which moistens and lubricates their surfaces, as was explained in SectionXXIII. 2. Some have doubted, whether this mucus is separated from the bloodby an appropriated set of glands, or exudes through the membranes, or is anabrasion or destruction of the surface of the membrane itself, which iscontinually repaired on the other side of it, but the great analogy betweenthe capillary vessels, and the other glands, countenances the formeropinion; and evinces, that these capillaries are the glands, that secreteit; to which we must add, that the blood in passing these capillary vesselsundergoes a change in its colour from florid to purple, and gives out aquantity of heat; from whence, as in other glands, we must conclude thatsomething is secreted from it."|FALSE

First, when a membrane becomes affected with torpor, or inactivity ofthe vessels which compose it, pain and coldness succeed, as in thehemicrania, and other head-achs, which are generally termed nervousrheumatism; they exist whether the part be at rest or in motion, and aregenerally attended with other marks of debility."|FALSE
15707|"Another rheumatism is said to exist, when inflammation and swelling, aswell as pain, affect some of the membranes of the joints, as of the ancles,wrists, knees, elbows, and sometimes of the ribs. This is accompanied withfever, is analogous to pleurisy and other inflammations, and is termed theacute rheumatism."|FALSE
15707|"A third disease is called chronic rheumatism, which is distinguished fromthat first mentioned, as in this the pain only affects the patient duringthe motion of the part, and from the second kind of rheumatism abovedescribed, as it is not attended with quick pulse or inflammation. It isgenerally believed to succeed the acute rheumatism of the same part, andthat some coagulable lymph, or cretaceous, or calculous material, has beenleft on the membrane; which gives pain, when the muscles move over it, assome extraneous body would do, which was too insoluble to be absorbed.Hence there is an analogy between this chronic rheumatism and the diseaseswhich produce gravel or gout-stones; and it may perhaps receive relief fromthe same remedies, such as aerated sal soda."|FALSE

15707|"The veins resemble the other absorbent vessels; as the progression of theircontents is carried on in the same manner in both, they alike absorb theirappropriated fluids, and have valves to prevent its regurgitation by theaccidents of mechanical violence. This appears first, because there is nopulsation in the very beginnings of the veins, as is seen by microscopes;which must happen, if the blood was carried into them by the actions of thearteries. For though the concurrence of various venous streams of bloodfrom different distances must prevent any pulsation in the larger branches,yet in the very beginnings of all these branches a pulsation mustunavoidably exist, if the circulation in them was owing to the intermittedforce of the arteries. Secondly, the venous absorption of blood from thepenis, and from the teats of female animals after their erection, is stillmore similar to the lymphatic absorption, as it is previously poured intocells, where all arterial impulse must cease."|FALSE
15707|"There is an experiment, which seems to evince this venous absorption, whichconsists in the external application of a stimulus to the lips, as ofvinegar, by which they become instantly pale; that is, the bibulous mouthsof the veins by this stimulus are excited to absorb the blood faster, thanit can be supplied by the usual arterial exertion. See Sect. XXIII. 5."|FALSE
15707|"There are two kinds of hæmorrhages frequent in diseases, one is where theglandular or capillary action is too powerfully exerted, and propels theblood forwards more hastily, than the veins can absorb it; and the otheris, where the absorbent power of the veins is diminished, or a branch ofthem is become totally paralytic."|FALSE

Sometimes thehæmorrhage recurs by daily periods accompanying the hot fits of fever, andceasing in the cold fits, or in the intermissions; this is to be cured byremoving the febrile paroxysms, which will be treated of in their place.Otherwise it is cured by venesection, by the internal or externalpreparations of lead, or by the application of cold, with an abstemiousdiet, and diluting liquids, like other inflammations.

The other kind of hæmorrhage is known from its being attended with aweak pulse, and other symptoms of general debility, and very frequentlyoccurs in those, who have diseased livers, owing to intemperance in the useof fermented liquors. These constitutions are shewn to be liable toparalysis of the lymphatic absorbents, producing the various kinds ofdropsies in Section XXIX. 5.

To relievethe difficult respiration, about six ounces of blood were taken from one ofthem, which to my surprise was sizy, like inflamed blood: they had bothpalpitations or unequal pulsations of the heart.

This blood, from its dark colour, and from the many vibicesand petechiæ, seems to have been venous blood; the quickness of the pulse,and the irregularity of the motion of the heart, are to be ascribed todebility of that part of the system; as the extravasation of bloodoriginated from the defect of venous absorption.

In the former case, where the mouths of thecutaneous lymphatics become torpid or quiescent, the fluid secreted on theskin ceases to be absorbed, and erodes the skin by its saline acrimony, andproduces eruptions termed herpes, the discharge from which is as salt, asthe tears, which are secreted too fast to be reabsorbed, as in grief, orwhen the puncta lacrymalia are obstructed, and which running down the cheekredden and inflame the skin."|FALSE

But as these valves are placed in vessels, which are induedwith life, and are themselves indued with life also; and are very irritableinto those natural motions, which absorb, or propel the fluids theycontain; it is possible, in some diseases, where these valves or vesselsare stimulated into unnatural exertions, or are become paralytic, thatduring the diastole of the part of the vessel to which the valve isattached, the valve may not so completely close, as to prevent the relapseof the lymph or chyle. This is rendered more probable, by the experimentsof injecting mercury, or water, or suet, or by blowing air down thesevessels: all which pass the valves very easily, contrary to the naturalcourse of their fluids, when the vessels are thus a little forciblydilated, as mentioned by Dr. Haller, Elem.

The principal of these valves is that, which presides over theinsertion of the thoracic duct, into the subclavian vein; many havebelieved this also to perform the office of a valve, both to admit thechyle into the vein, and to preclude the blood from entering the duct; butin my opinion it is scarcely sufficient for this purpose.\" Haller, Elem.Phys. t. vii. p. 226."|FALSE

De Haeu, by means of a syringe,forced so much water into the rectum intestinum of a dog, that he vomitedit in a full stream from his mouth; and in the iliac passion abovementioned, excrements and clyster are often evacuated by the mouth.

As the capillary vessels receive blood from the arteries, and separatingthe mucus, or perspirable matter from it, convey the remainder back by theveins; these capillary vessels are a set of glands, in every respectsimilar to the secretory vessels of the liver, or other large congeries ofglands. The beginnings of these capillary vessels have frequent anastomosesinto each other, in which circumstance they are resembled by the lacteals;and like the mouths or beginnings of other glands, they are a set ofabsorbent vessels, which drink up the blood which is brought to them by thearteries, as the chyle is drank up by the lacteals: for the circulation ofthe blood through the capillaries is proved to be independent of arterialimpulse; since in the blush of shame, and in partial inflammations, theiraction is increased, without any increase of the motion of the heart."|FALSE

Yet not only the mouths, or beginnings of these anastomosing capillariesare frequently seen by microscopes, to regurgitate some particles of blood,during the struggles of the animal; but retrograde motion of the blood, inthe veins of those animals, from the very heart of the extremity of thelimbs, is observable, by intervals, during the distresses of the dyingcreature. Haller, Elem. Physiol. t. i. p. 216. Now, as the veins haveperhaps all of them a valve somewhere between their extremities and theheart, here is ocular demonstration of the fluids in this diseasedcondition of the animal, repassing through venous valves: and it is hencehighly probable, from the strictest analogy, that if the course of thefluids, in the lymphatic vessels, could be subjected to microscopicobservation, they would also, in the diseased state of the animal, be seento repass the valves, and the mouths of those vessels, which had previouslyabsorbed them, or promoted their progression."|FALSE

15707|"From all which it must be concluded, that some fluids have passed from thestomach or abdomen, without having gone through the sanguiferouscirculation: and as the bladder is supplied with many lymphatics, asdescribed by Dr. Watson, in the Philos.

15707|"The more certainly to ascertain the existence of another communicationbetween the stomach and bladder, besides that of the circulation, thefollowing experiment was made, to which I must beg your patientattention:--A friend of mine (June 14, 1772) on drinking repeatedly of coldsmall punch, till he began to be intoxicated, made a quantity of colourlessurine. He then drank about two drams of nitre dissolved in some of thepunch, and eat about twenty stalks of boiled asparagus: on continuing todrink more of the punch, the next urine that he made was quite clear, andwithout smell; but in a little time another quantity was made, which wasnot quite so colourless, and had a strong smell of the asparagus: he thenlost about four ounces of blood from the arm."|FALSE

15707|"The phenomena of many diseases are only explicable from the retrogrademotions of some of the branches of the lymphatic system; as the great andimmediate flow of pale urine in the beginning of drunkenness; in hystericparoxysms; from being exposed to cold air; or to the influence of fear oranxiety."|FALSE
15707|"Before we endeavour to illustrate this doctrine, by describing thephænomena of these diseases, we must premise one circumstance; that all thebranches of the lymphatic system have a certain sympathy with each other,insomuch that when one branch is stimulated into unusual kinds orquantities of motion, some other branch has its motions either increased,or decreased, or inverted at the same time. This kind of sympathy can onlybe proved by the concurrent testimony of numerous facts, which will berelated in the course of the work. I shall only add here, that it isprobable, that this sympathy does not depend on any communication ofnervous filaments, but on habit; owing to the various branches of thissystem having frequently been stimulated into action at the same time."|FALSE
15707|"There are a thousand instances of involuntary motions associated in thismanner; as in the act of vomiting, while the motions of the stomach andoesophagus are inverted, the pulsations of the arterial system by a certainsympathy become weaker; and when the bowels or kidneys are stimulated bypoison, a stone, or inflammation, into more violent action; the stomach andoesophagus by sympathy invert their motions."|FALSE
15707|"1. When any one drinks a moderate quantity of vinous spirit, the wholesystem acts with more energy by consent with the stomach and intestines, asis seen from the glow on the skin, and the increase of strength andactivity; but when a greater quantity of this inebriating material isdrank, at the same time that the lacteals are excited into greater actionto absorb it; it frequently happens, that the urinary branch of absorbents,which is connected with the lacteals by many anastomoses, inverts itsmotions, and a great quantity of pale unanimalized urine is discharged. Bythis wise contrivance too much of an unnecessary fluid is prevented fromentering the circulation--This may be called the drunken diabetes, todistinguish it from the other temporary diabetes, which occur in hystericdiseases, and from continued fear or anxiety."|FALSE
15707|"2. If this idle ingurgitation of too much vinous spirit be daily practised,the urinary branch of absorbents at length gains an habit of inverting itsmotions, whenever the lacteals are much stimulated; and the whole or agreat part of the chyle is thus daily carried to the bladder withoutentering the circulation, and the body becomes emaciated. This is one kindof chronic diabetes, and may be distinguished from the others by the tasteand appearance of the urine; which is sweet, and the colour of whey, andmay be termed the chyliferous diabetes."|FALSE
15707|"3. Many children have a similar deposition of chyle in their urine, fromthe irritation of worms in their intestines, which stimulating the mouthsof the lacteals into unnatural action, the urinary branch of the absorbentsbecomes inverted, and carries part of the chyle to the bladder: part of thechyle also has been carried to the iliac and lumbar glands, of whichinstances are recorded by Haller, t. vii. 225. and which can be explainedon no other theory: but the dissections of the lymphatic system of thehuman body, which have yet been published, are not sufficiently extensivefor our purpose; yet if we may reason from comparative anatomy, thistranslation of chyle to the bladder is much illustrated by the accountgiven of this system of vessels in a turtle, by Mr. Hewson, who observed,\"That the lacteals near the root of the mesentery anastomose, so as to forma net-work, from which several large branches go into some considerablelymphatics lying near the spine; and which can be traced almost to theanus, and particularly to the kidneys.\" Philos.

At the same time that the urinary branch of absorbents, in the beginningof diabetes, is excited into inverted action, the cellular branch isexcited by the sympathy above mentioned, into more energetic action; andthe fat, that was before deposited, is reabsorbed and thrown into the bloodvessels; where it floats, and was mistaken for chyle, till the lateexperiments of the ingenious Mr. Hewson demonstrated it to be fat."|FALSE
15707|"This appearance of what was mistaken for chyle in the blood, which wasdrawn from these patients, and the obstructed liver, which very frequentlyaccompanies this disease, seems to have led Dr. Mead to suspect thediabetes was owing to a defect of sanguification; and that the schirrosityof the liver was the original cause of it: but as the schirrhus of theliver is most frequently owing to the same causes, that produce thediabetes and dropsies; namely, the great use of fermented liquors; there isno wonder they should exist together, without being the consequence of eachother."|FALSE
15707|"5. If the cutaneous branch of absorbents gains a habit of being excitedinto stronger action, and imbibes greater quantities of moisture from theatmosphere, at the same time that the urinary branch has its motionsinverted, another kind of diabetes is formed, which may be termed theaqueous diabetes. In this diabetes the cutaneous absorbents frequentlyimbibe an amazing quantity of atmospheric moisture; insomuch that there areauthentic histories, where many gallons a day, for many weeks together,above the quantity that has been drank, have been discharged by urine."|FALSE

The purging stools, and pale urine, occasioned by exposing the nakedbody to cold air, or sprinkling it with cold water, originate from asimilar cause; for the mouths of the cutaneous lymphatics being suddenlyexposed to cold become torpid, and cease, or nearly cease, to act; whilst,by the sympathy above described, not only the lymphatics of the bladder andintestines cease also to absorb the more aqueous and saline part of thefluids secreted into them; but it is probable that these lymphatics inverttheir motions, and return the fluids, which were previously absorbed, intothe intestines and bladder. At the very instant that the body is exposednaked to the cold air, an unusual movement is felt in the bowels; as isexperienced by boys going into the cold bath: this could not occur from anobstruction of the perspirable matter, since there is not time, for that tobe returned to the bowels by the course of the circulation."|FALSE
15707|"There is also a chronic aqueous diarrhoea, in which the atmosphericmoisture, drank up by the cutaneous and pulmonary lymphatics, is pouredinto the intestines, by the retrograde motions of the lacteals. Thisdisease is most similar to the aqueous diabetes, and is frequentlyexchanged for it: a distinct instance of this is recorded by Benningerus,Cent. v. Obs. 98. in which an aqueous diarrhoea succeeded an aqueousdiabetes, and destroyed the patient. There is a curious example of this,described by Sympson (De Re Medica)--\"A young man (says he) was seized witha fever, upon which a diarrhoea came on, with great stupor; and he refusedto drink any thing, though he was parched up with excessive heat: thebetter to supply him with moisture, I directed his feet to be immersed incold water; immediately I observed a wonderful decrease of water in thevessel, and then an impetuous stream of a fluid, scarcely coloured, wasdischarged by stool, like a cataract.\""|FALSE
15707|"7. There is another kind of diarrhoea, which has been called cæliaca; inthis disease the chyle, drank up by the lacteals of the small intestines,is probably poured into the large intestines, by the retrograde motions oftheir lacteals: as in the chyliferous diabetes, the chyle is poured intothe bladder, by the retrograde motions of the urinary branch of absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"The chyliferous diabetes, like this chyliferous diarrhoea, produces suddenatrophy; since the nourishment, which ought to supply the hourly waste ofthe body, is expelled by the bladder, or rectum: whilst the aqueousdiabetes, and the aqueous diarrhoea produce excessive thirst; because themoisture, which is obtained from the atmosphere, is not conveyed to thethoracic receptacle, as it ought to be, but to the bladder, or lowerintestines; whence the chyle, blood, and whole system of glands, are robbedof their proportion of humidity."|FALSE
15707|"8. There is a third species of diabetes, in which the urine ismucilaginous, and appears ropy in pouring it from one vessel into another;and will sometimes coagulate over the fire. This disease appears byintervals, and ceases again, and seems to be occasioned by a previousdropsy in some part of the body. When such a collection is reabsorbed, itis not always returned into the circulation; but the same irritation thatstimulates one lymphatic branch to reabsorb the deposited fluid, invertsthe urinary branch, and pours it into the bladder. Hence this mucilaginousdiabetes is a cure, or the consequence of a cure, of a worse disease,rather than a disease itself."|FALSE

15707|"This kind of diabetes frequently precedes a dropsy; and has this remarkablecircumstance attending it, that it generally happens in the night; asduring the recumbent state of the body, the fluid, that was accumulated inthe cellular membrane, or in the lungs, is more readily absorbed, as it isless impeded by its gravity. I have seen more than one instance of thisdisease. Mr. D. a man in the decline of life, who had long accustomedhimself to spirituous liquor, had swelled legs, and other symptoms ofapproaching anasarca; about once in a week, or ten days, for severalmonths, he was seized, on going to bed, with great general uneasiness,which his attendants resembled to an hysteric fit; and which terminated ina great discharge of viscid urine; his legs became less swelled, and hecontinued in better health for some days afterwards. I had not theopportunity to try if this urine would coagulate over the fire, when partof it was evaporated, which I imagine would be the criterion of this kindof diabetes; as the mucilaginous fluid deposited in the cells and cysts ofthe body, which have no communication with the external air, seems toacquire, by stagnation, this property of coagulation by heat, which thesecreted mucus of the intestines and bladder do not appear to possess; as Ihave found by experiment: and if any one should suppose this coagulableurine was separated from the blood by the kidneys, he may recollect, thatin the most inflammatory diseases, in which the blood is most replete ormost ready to part with the coagulable lymph, none of this appears in theurine."|FALSE
15707|"9. Different kinds of diabetes require different methods of cure. For thefirst kind, or chyliferous diabetes, after clearing the stomach andintestines, by ipecacuanha and rhubarb, to evacuate any acid material,which may too powerfully stimulate the mouths of the lacteals, repeated andlarge doses of tincture of cantharides have been much recommended. Thespecific stimulus of this medicine, on the neck of the bladder, is likelyto excite the numerous absorbent vessels, which are spread on that part,into stronger natural actions, and by that means prevent their retrogradeones; till, by persisting in the use of the medicine, their natural habitsof motions might again be established. Another indication of cure, requiressuch medicines, as by lining the intestines with mucilaginous substances,or with such as consist of smooth particles, or which chemically destroythe acrimony of their contents, may prevent the too great action of theintestinal absorbents. For this purpose, I have found the earthprecipitated from a solution of alum, by means of fixed alcali, given inthe dose of half a dram every six hours, of great advantage, with a fewgrains of rhubarb, so as to produce a daily evacuation."|FALSE
15707|"The food should consist of materials that have the least stimulus, withcalcareous water, as of Bristol and Matlock; that the mouths of thelacteals may be as little stimulated as is necessary for their properabsorption; lest with their greater exertions, should be connected bysympathy, the inverted motions of the urinary lymphatics."|FALSE
15707|"The same method may be employed with equal advantage in the aqueousdiabetes, so great is the sympathy between the skin and the stomach. Towhich, however, some application to the skin might be usefully added; asrubbing the patient all over with oil, to prevent the too great action ofthe cutaneous absorbents.

From this stronger action ofthose absorbents, which still retain their irritability, the fat is alsoabsorbed, and the whole body becomes emaciated.

15707|"The cure of anasarca, so far as respects the evacuation of the accumulatedfluid, coincides with the idea of the retrograde action of the lymphaticsystem. It is well known that vomits, and other drugs, which inducesickness or nausea; at the same time that they evacuate the stomach,produce a great absorption of the lymph accumulated in the cellularmembrane. In the operation of a vomit, not only the motions of the stomachand duodenum become inverted, but also those of the lymphatics andlacteals, which belong to them; whence a great quantity of chyle and lymphis perpetually poured into the stomach and intestines, during theoperation, and evacuated by the mouth. Now at the same time, other branchesof the lymphatic system, viz. those which open on the cellular membrane,are brought into more energetic action, by the sympathy above mentioned,and an increase of their absorption is produced."|FALSE

For this acrid metallic preparation, beingabsorbed by the mouth of the lacteals, continues, for a time arrested bythe mesenteric glands, (as the variolous or venereal poisons swell thesubaxillar or inguinal glands): which, during the operation of a cathartic,is returned into the intestines by the inverted action of the lacteals, andthus carried out of the system."|FALSE

In thiscase, was not the milk taken up from the follicles of the pectoral glands,and thrown on the intestines, by a retrogression of the intestinalabsorbents? for how can we for a moment suspect that the mucous glands ofthe intestines could separate pure milk from the blood?

15707|"1. We frequently observe an unusual quantity of mucus or other fluids insome diseases, although the action of the glands, by which those fluids areseparated from the blood, is not unusually increased; but when the power ofabsorption alone is diminished. Thus the catarrhal humour from the nostrilsof some, who ride in frosty weather; and the tears, which run down thecheeks of those, who have an obstruction of the puncta lacrymalia; and theichor of those phagedenic ulcers, which are not attended with inflammation,are all instances of this circumstance."|FALSE
15707|"These fluids however are easily distinguished from others by theirabounding in ammoniacal or muriatic salts; whence they inflame thecircumjacent skin: thus in the catarrh the upper lip becomes red andswelled from the acrimony of the mucus, and patients complain of thesaltness of its taste. The eyes and cheeks are red with the corrosivetears, and the ichor of some herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide thecontiguous parts, and is pungently salt to the taste, as some patients haveinformed me."|FALSE
15707|"Whilst, on the contrary, those fluids, which are effused by the retrogradeaction of the lymphatics, are for the most part mild and innocent; aswater, chyle, and the natural mucus: or they take their properties from thematerials previously absorbed, as in the coloured or vinous urine, or thatscented with asparagus, described before."|FALSE
15707|"2. Whenever the secretion of any fluid is increased, there is at the sametime an increased heat in the part; for the secreted fluid, as the bile,did not previously exist in the mass of blood, but a new combination isproduced in the gland. Now as solutions are attended with cold, socombinations are attended with heat; and it is probable the sum of the heatgiven out by all the secreted fluids of animal bodies may be the cause oftheir general heat above that of the atmosphere."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the fluids derived from increased secretions are readilydistinguished from those originating from the retrograde motions of thelymphatics: thus an increase of heat either in the diseased parts, ordiffused over the whole body, is perceptible, when copious bilious stoolsare consequent to an inflamed liver; or a copious mucous salivation fromthe inflammatory angina."|FALSE
15707|"3. When any secreted fluid is produced in an unusual quantity, and at thesame time the power of absorption is increased in equal proportion, notonly the heat of the gland becomes more intense, but the secreted fluidbecomes thicker and milder, its thinner and saline parts being re-absorbed:and these are distinguishable both by their greater consistence, and bytheir heat, from the fluids, which are effused by the retrograde motions ofthe lymphatics; as is observable towards the termination of gonorrhoea,catarrh, chincough, and in those ulcers, which are said to abound withlaudable pus."|FALSE

Another law of irritation, connate with our existence, is, that allthose parts of the body, which have previously been exposed to too great aquantity of such stimuli, as strongly affect them, become for some timeafterwards disobedient to the natural quantity of their adaptedstimuli.--Thus the eye is incapable of seeing objects in an obscure room,though the iris is quite dilated, after having been exposed to the meridiansun."|FALSE
15707|"3. There is a third law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies,which have been lately subjected to less stimulus, than they have beenaccustomed to, when they are exposed to their usual quantity of stimulus,are excited into more energetic motions: thus when we come from a duskycavern into the glare of daylight, our eyes are dazzled; and after emergingfrom the cold bath, the skin becomes warm and red."|FALSE
15707|"4. There is a fourth law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies,which are subjected to still stronger stimuli for a length of time, becometorpid, and refuse to obey even these stronger stimuli; and thence do theiroffices very imperfectly.--Thus, if any one looks earnestly for someminutes on an area, an inch diameter, of red silk, placed on a sheet ofwhite paper, the image of the silk will gradually become pale, and atlength totally vanish."|FALSE
15707|"5. Nor is it the nerves of sense alone, as the optic and auditory nerves,that thus become torpid, when the stimulus is withdrawn or theirirritability decreased; but the motive muscles, when they are deprived oftheir natural stimuli, or of their irritability, become torpid andparalytic; as is seen in the tremulous hand of the drunkard in a morning;and in the awkward step of age."|FALSE
15707|"The hollow muscles also, of which the various vessels of the body areconstructed, when they are deprived of their natural stimuli, or of theirdue degree of irritability, not only become tremulous, as the arterialpulsations of dying people; but also frequently invert their motions, as invomiting, in hysteric suffocations, and diabetes above described."|FALSE
15707|"I must beg your patient attention, for a few moments whilst I endeavour toexplain, how the retrograde actions of our hollow muscles are theconsequence of their debility; as the tremulous actions of the solidmuscles are the consequence of their debility. When, through fatigue, amuscle can act no longer; the antagonist muscles, either by their inanimateelasticity, or by their animal action, draw the limb into a contrarydirection: in the solid muscles, as those of locomotion, their actions areassociated in tribes, which have been accustomed to synchronous actiononly; hence when they are fatigued, only a single contrary effort takesplace; which is either tremulous, when the fatigued muscles are againimmediately brought into action; or it is a pandiculation, or stretching,where they are not immediately again brought into action."|FALSE
15707|"Now the motions of the hollow muscles, as they in general propel a fluidalong their cavities, are associated in trains, which have been accustomedto successive actions: hence when one ring of such a muscle is fatiguedfrom its too great debility, and is brought into retrograde action, thenext ring from its association falls successively into retrograde action;and so on throughout the whole canal.

15707|"When a still greater quantity of wine, or of opium, or when nauseousvegetables, or strong bitters, or metallic salts, are taken into thestomach, they quickly induce vomiting; though all these in less dosesexcite the stomach into more energetic action, and strengthen thedigestion; as the flowers of chamomile, and the vitriol of zinc: for,according to the fourth law of irritation, the stomach will not long beobedient to a stimulus so much greater than is natural; but its actionbecomes first tremulous and then retrograde."|FALSE

From the ingurgitation of spirituous liquors into the stomach andduodenum, the termination of the common bile-duct in that bowel becomesstimulated into unnatural action, and a greater quantity of bile isproduced from all the secretory vessels of the liver, by the association oftheir motions with those of their excretory ducts; as has been explained inSection XXIV. and XXV. but as all parts of the body, that have beenaffected with stronger stimuli for any length of time, become lesssusceptible of motion, from their natural weaker stimuli, it follows, thatthe motions of the secretory vessels, and in consequence the secretion ofbile, is less than is natural during the intervals of sobriety. 2. If thisingurgitation of spirituous liquors has been daily continued inconsiderable quantity, and is then suddenly intermitted, a languor orparalysis of the common bile-duct is induced; the bile is prevented frombeing poured into the intestines; and as the bilious absorbents arestimulated into stronger action by its accumulation, and by the acrimony orviscidity, which it acquires by delay, it is absorbed, and carried to thereceptacle of the chyle; or otherwise the secretory vessels of the liver,by the above-mentioned stimulus, invert their motions, and regurgitatetheir contents into the blood, as sometimes happens to the tears in thelachrymal sack, see Sect. XXIV. 2. 7. and one kind of jaundice is broughton."|FALSE
15707|"There is reason to believe, that the bile is most frequently returned intothe circulation by the inverted motions of these hepatic glands, for thebile does not seem liable to be absorbed by the lymphatics, for it soaksthrough the gall-ducts, and is frequently found in the cellular membrane.This kind of jaundice is not generally attended with pain, neither at theextremity of the bile-duct, where it enters the duodenum, nor on the regionof the gall-bladder."|FALSE

On a supposition that the obstruction of thebile might be owing to the paralysis, or torpid action of the commonbile-duct, and the stimulants taken into the stomach seeming to have noeffect, I directed half a score smart electric shocks from a coated bottle,which held about a quart, to be passed through the liver, and along thecourse of the common gall-duct, as near as could be guessed, and on thatvery day the stools became yellow; he continued the electric shocks a fewdays more, and his skin gradually became clear."|FALSE
15707|"3. The bilious vomiting and purging, that affects some people by intervalsof a few weeks, is a less degree of this disease; the bile-duct is lessirritable than natural, and hence the bile becomes accumulated in thegall-bladder, and hepatic ducts, till by its quantity, acrimony orviscidity, a greater degree of irritation is produced, and it is suddenlyevacuated, or lastly from the absorption of the more liquid parts of thebile, the remainder becomes inspissated, and chrystallizes into masses toolarge to pass, and forms another kind of jaundice, where the bile-duct isnot quite paralytic, or has regained its irritability."|FALSE

But what is peculiar to thisdisease, and distinguishes it from all others at the first glance of theeye, is the bombycinous colour of the skin, which, like that of full-grownsilkworms, has a degree of transparency with a yellow tint not greater thanis natural to the serum of the blood."|FALSE

When the paralysis of the hepatic glands is less complete, or lessuniversal, a schirrosity of some part of the liver is induced; for thesecretory vessels retaining some of their living power take up a fluid fromthe circulation, without being sufficiently irritable to carry it forwardsto their excretory ducts; hence the body, or receptacle of each gland,becomes inflated, and this distension increases, till by its very greatstimulus inflammation is produced, or till those parts of the viscus becometotally paralytic. This disease is distinguishable from the foregoing bythe palpable hardness or largeness of the liver; and as the hepatic glandsare not totally paralytic, or the whole liver not affected, some bilecontinues to be made. The inflammations of this viscus, consequent to theschirrosity of it, belong to the diseases of the sensitive motions, andwill be treated of hereafter."|FALSE

15707|"II. The irritative diseases of the kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and otherglands, are analogous to those of the liver above described, differing onlyin the consequences attending their inability to action. For instance, whenthe secretory vessels of the kidneys become disobedient to the stimulus ofthe passing current of blood, no urine is separated or produced by them;their excretory mouths become filled with concreted mucus, or calculusmatter, and in eight or ten days stupor and death supervenes in consequenceof the retention of the feculent part of the blood."|FALSE

15707|"This torpor, or paralysis of the secretory vessels of the kidneys, likethat of the liver, owes its origin to their being previously habituated totoo great stimulus; which in this country is generally owing to the alcoholcontained in ale or wine; and hence must be registered amongst the diseasesowing to inebriety; though it may be caused by whatever occasionallyinflames the kidney; as too violent riding on horseback, or the cold from adamp bed, or by sleeping on the cold ground; or perhaps by drinking ingeneral too little aqueous fluids."|FALSE

Whereas the diseases,which are caused by sensation and volition, most frequently originate fromthe excess of those sensorial powers, as will be explained below."|FALSE

The third mostmarked circumstance in this constitution is, that the extremities, as thehands and feet, or nose and ears, are liable to become cold and pale insituations in respect to warmth, where those of greater strength are notaffected.

Dr. Maningham, apopular accoucheur in the beginning of this century, observes in hisaphorisms, that broad-shouldered men procreate broad-shouldered children.Now as labour strengthens the muscles employed, and increases their bulk,it would seem that a few generations of labour or of indolence may in thisrespect change the form and temperament of the body."|FALSE
15707|"On the contrary, those who are happily possessed of a great degree ofirritability, bear labour better than pain; and are strong, active, andingenious. But there is not properly a temperament of increasedirritability tending to disease, because an increased quantity ofirritative motions generally induces an increase of pleasure or pain, as inintoxication, or inflammation; and then the new motions are the immediateconsequences of increased sensation, not of increased irritation; whichhave hence been so perpetually confounded with each other."|FALSE

15707|"There is not properly a temperament, or predisposition to disease, fromdecreased sensibility, since irritability and not sensibility isimmediately necessary to bodily health. Hence it is the excess of sensationalone, as it is the defect of irritation, that most frequently producesdisease. This temperament of increased sensibility is known from theincreased activity of all those motions of the organs of sense and muscles,which are exerted in consequence of pleasure or pain, as in the beginningof drunkenness, and in inflammatory fever. Hence those of this constitutionare liable to inflammatory diseases, as hepatitis; and to that kind ofconsumption which is hereditary, and commences with slight repeatedhæmoptoe. They have high-coloured lips, frequently dark hair and dark eyeswith large pupils, and are in that case subject to gutta serena. They areliable to enthusiasm, delirium, and reverie.

XIX. on reverie."|FALSE
15707|"As in these constitutions more than the natural quantities of sensitivemotions are produced by the increased quantity of sensation existing in thehabit, it follows, that the irritative motions will be performed in somedegree with less energy, owing to the great expenditure of sensorial poweron the sensitive ones. Hence those of this temperament do not attend toslight stimulations, as explained in Sect. XIX. But when a stimulus is sogreat as to excite sensation, it produces greater sensitive actions of thesystem than in others; such as delirium or inflammation.

XXXIV.

When the contractile sides of the heart and arteries perform a greaternumber of pulsations in a given time, and move through a greater area ateach pulsation, whether these motions are occasioned by the stimulus of theacrimony or quantity of the blood, or by their association with otherirritative motions, or by the increased irritability of the arterialsystem, that is, by an increased quantity of sensorial power, one kind offever is produced; which may be called Synocha irritativa, or Febrisirritativa pulsu forti, or irritative fever with strong pulse."|FALSE

The former of thesefevers is the synocha of nosologists, and the latter the typhus mitior, ornervous fever.

XII. 1. 3."|FALSE

15707|"II. For the better illustration of the phenomena of irritative fevers wemust refer the reader to the circumstances of irritation explained in Sect.XII. and shall commence this intricate subject by speaking of the quickpulse, and proceed by considering many of the causes, which eitherseparately or in combination most frequently produce the cold fits offevers."|FALSE
15707|"1. If the arteries are dilated but to half their usual diameters, thoughthey contract twice as frequently in a given time, they will circulate onlyhalf their usual quantity of blood: for as they are cylinders, the bloodwhich they contain must be as the squares of their diameters. Hence whenthe pulse becomes quicker and smaller in the same proportion, the heart andarteries act with less energy than in their natural state. See Sect. XII.1. 4."|FALSE
15707|"That this quick small pulse is owing to want of irritability, appears,first, because it attends other symptoms of want of irritability; and,secondly, because on the application of a stimulus greater than usual, itbecomes slower and larger. Thus in cold fits of agues, in hystericpalpitations of the heart, and when the body is much exhausted byhæmorrhages, or by fatigue, as well as in nervous fevers, the pulse becomesquick and small; and secondly, in all those cases if an increase ofstimulus be added, by giving a little wine or opium; the quick small pulsebecomes slower and larger, as any one may easily experience on himself, bycounting his pulse after drinking one or two glasses of wine, when he isfaint from hunger or fatigue."|FALSE
15707|"Now nothing can so strongly evince that this quick small pulse is owing todefect of irritability, than that an additional stimulus, above what isnatural, makes it become slower and larger immediately: for what is meantby a defect of irritability, but that the arteries and heart are notexcited into their usual exertions by their usual quantity of stimulus? butif you increase the quantity of stimulus, and they immediately act withtheir usual energy, this proves their previous want of their natural degreeof irritability. Thus the trembling hands of drunkards in a morning becomesteady, and acquire strength to perform their usual offices, by theaccustomed stimulus of a glass or two of brandy."|FALSE
15707|"2. In sleep and in apoplexy the pulse becomes slower, which is not owing todefect of irritability, for it is at the same time larger; and thence thequantity of the circulation is rather increased than diminished. In thesecases the organs of sense are closed, and the voluntary power is suspended,while the motions dependent on internal irritations, as those of digestionand secretion, are carried on with more than their usual vigour; which hasled superficial observers to confound these cases with those arising fromwant of irritability. Thus if you lift up the eyelid of an apoplecticpatient, who is not actually dying, the iris will, as usual, contractitself, as this motion is associated with the stimulus of light; but it isnot so in the last stages of nervous fevers, where the pupil of the eyecontinues expanded in the broad day-light: in the former case there is awant of voluntary power, in the latter a want of irritability."|FALSE
15707|"Hence also those constitutions which are deficient in quantity ofirritability, and which possess too great sensibility, as during the painof hunger, of hysteric spasms, or nervous headachs, are generally supposedto have too much irritability; and opium, which in its due dose is a mostpowerful stimulant, is erroneously called a sedative; because by increasingthe irritative motions it decreases the pains arising from defect of them."|FALSE
15707|"Why the pulse should become quicker both from an increase of irritation, asin the synocha irritativa, or irritative fever with strong pulse; and fromthe decrease of it, as in the typhus irritativus, or irritative fever withweak pulse; seems paradoxical. The former circumstance needs noillustration; since if the stimulus of the blood, or the irritability ofthe sanguiferous system be increased, and the strength of the patient notdiminished, it is plain that the motions must be performed quicker andstronger."|FALSE
15707|"In the latter circumstance the weakness of the muscular power of the heartis soon over-balanced by the elasticity of the coats of the arteries, whichthey possess besides a muscular power of contraction; and hence thearteries are distended to less than their usual diameters. The heart beingthus stopped, when it is but half emptied, begins sooner to dilate again;and the arteries being dilated to less than their usual diameters, begin somuch sooner to contract themselves; insomuch, that in the last stages offevers with weakness the frequency of pulsation of the heart and arteriesbecomes doubled; which, however, is never the case in fevers with strength,in which they seldom exceed 118 or 120 pulsations in a minute. It must beadded, that in these cases, while the pulse is very small and very quick,the heart often feels large, and labouring to one's hand; which coincideswith the above explanation, shewing that it does not completely emptyitself."|FALSE
15707|"3. In cases however of debility from paucity of blood, as in animals whichare bleeding to death in the slaughter-house, the quick pulsations of theheart and arteries may be owing to their not being distended to more thanhalf their usual diastole; and in consequence they must contract sooner, ormore frequently, in a given time. As weak people are liable to a deficientquantity of blood, this cause may occasionally contribute to quicken thepulse in fevers with debility, which may be known by applying one's handupon the heart as above; but the principal cause I suppose to consist inthe diminution of sensorial power. When a muscle contains, or is suppliedwith but little sensorial power, its contraction soon ceases, and inconsequence may soon recur, as is seen in the trembling hands of peopleweakened by age or by drunkenness. See Sect. XII. 1. 4. XII. 3. 4."|FALSE
15707|"It may nevertheless frequently happen, that both the deficiency ofstimulus, as where the quantity of blood is lessened (as described in No.4. of this section), and the deficiency of sensorial power, as in those ofthe temperament of irritability, described in Sect. XXXI. occur at the sametime; which will thus add to the quickness of the pulse and to the dangerof the disease."|FALSE
15707|"III. 1. A certain degree of heat is necessary to muscular motion, and is,in consequence, essential to life. This is observed in those animals andinsects which pass the cold season in a torpid state, and which revive onbeing warmed by the fire. This necessary stimulus of heat has two sources;one from the fluid atmosphere of heat, in which all things are immersed,and the other from the internal combinations of the particles, which formthe various fluids, which are produced in the extensive systems of theglands. When either the external heat, which surrounds us, or the internalproduction of it, becomes lessened to a certain degree, the pain of cold isperceived."|FALSE
15707|"This pain of cold is experienced most sensibly by our teeth, when ice isheld in the mouth; or by our whole system after having been previouslyaccustomed to much warmth. It is probable, that this pain does not arisefrom the mechanical or chemical effects of a deficiency of heat; but that,like the organs of sense by which we perceive hunger and thirst, this senseof heat suffers pain, when the stimulus of its object is wanting to excitethe irritative motions of the organ; that is, when the sensorial powerbecomes too much accumulated in the quiescent fibres. See Sect. XII. 5. 3.For as the peristaltic motions of the stomach are lessened, when the painof hunger is great, so the action of the cutaneous capillaries are lessenedduring the pain of cold; as appears by the paleness of the skin, asexplained in Sect. XIV. 6. on the production of ideas."|FALSE
15707|"The pain in the small of the back and forehead in the cold fits of theague, in nervous hemicrania, and in hysteric paroxysms, when all theirritative motions are much impaired, seems to arise from this cause; thevessels of these membranes or muscles become torpid by their irritativeassociations with other parts of the body, and thence produce less of theiraccustomed secretions, and in consequence less heat is evolved, and theyexperience the pain of cold; which coldness may often be felt by the handapplied upon the affected part."|FALSE
15707|"2. The importance of a greater or less deduction of heat from the systemwill be more easy to comprehend, if we first consider the great expense ofsensorial power used in carrying on the vital motions; that is, whichcirculates, absorbs, secretes, aerates, and elaborates the whole mass offluids with unceasing assiduity. The sensorial power, or spirit ofanimation, used in giving perpetual and strong motion to the heart, whichovercomes the elasticity and vis inertiæ of the whole arterial system; nextthe expense of sensorial power in moving with great force and velocity theinnumerable trunks and ramifications of the arterial system; the expense ofsensorial power in circulating the whole mass of blood through the long andintricate intortions of the very fine vessels, which compose the glands andcapillaries; then the expense of sensorial power in the exertions of theabsorbent extremities of all the lacteals, and of all the lymphatics, whichopen their mouths on the external surface of the skin, and on the internalsurfaces of every cell or interstice of the body; then the expense ofsensorial power in the venous absorption, by which the blood is receivedfrom the capillary vessels, or glands, where the arterial power ceases, andis drank up, and returned to the heart; next the expense of sensorial powerused by the muscles of respiration in their office of perpetually expandingthe bronchia, or air-vessels, of the lungs; and lastly in the unceasingperistaltic motions of the stomach and whole system of intestines, and inall the secretions of bile, gastric juice, mucus, perspirable matter, andthe various excretions from the system. If we consider the ceaselessexpense of sensorial power thus perpetually employed, it will appear to bemuch greater in a day than all the voluntary exertions of our muscles andorgans of sense consume in a week; and all this without any sensiblefatigue! Now, if but a part of these vital motions are impeded, or totallystopped for but a short time, we gain an idea, that there must be a greataccumulation of sensorial power; as its production in these organs, whichare subject to perpetual activity, is continued during their quiescence,and is in consequence accumulated."|FALSE
15707|"While, on the contrary, where those vital organs act too forcibly byincrease of stimulus without a proportionally-increased production ofsensorial power in the brain, it is evident, that a great deficiency ofaction, that is torpor, must soon follow, as in fevers; whereas thelocomotive muscles, which act only by intervals, are neither liable to sogreat accumulation of sensorial power during their times of inactivity, norto so great an exhaustion of it during their times of action."|FALSE
15707|"Thus, on going into a very cold bath, suppose at 33 degrees of heat onFahrenheit's scale, the action of the subcutaneous capillaries, or glands,and of the mouths of the cutaneous absorbents is diminished, or ceases fora time. Hence less or no blood passes these capillaries, and palenesssucceeds. But soon after emerging from the bath, a more florid colour and agreater degree of heat is generated on the skin than was possessed beforeimmersion; for the capillary glands, after this quiescent state, occasionedby the want of stimulus, become more irritable than usual to their naturalstimuli, owing to the accumulation of sensorial power, and hence a greaterquantity of blood is transmitted through them, and a greater secretion ofperspirable matter; and, in consequence, a greater degree of heat succeeds.During the continuance in cold water the breath is cold, and the act ofrespiration quick and laborious; which have generally been ascribed to theobstruction of the circulating fluid by a spasm of the cutaneous vessels,and by a consequent accumulation of blood in the lungs, occasioned by thepressure as well as by the coldness of the water. This is not asatisfactory account of this curious phænomenon, since at this time thewhole circulation is less, as appears from the smallness of the pulse andcoldness of the breath; which shew that less blood passes through the lungsin a given time; the same laborious breathing immediately occurs when thepaleness of the skin is produced by fear, where no external cold orpressure are applied."|FALSE
15707|"The minute vessels of the bronchia, through which the blood passes from thearterial to the venal system, and which correspond with the cutaneouscapillaries, have frequently been exposed to cold air, and become quiescentalong with those of the skin; and hence their motions are so associatedtogether, that when one is affected either with quiescence or exertion, theother sympathizes with it, according to the laws of irritative association.See Sect. XXVII. 1. on hæmorrhages."|FALSE
15707|"Besides the quiescence of the minute vessels of the lungs, there are manyother systems of vessels which become torpid from their irritativeassociations with those of the skin, as the absorbents of the bladder andintestines; whence an evacuation of pale urine occurs, when the naked skinis exposed only to the coldness of the atmosphere; and sprinkling the nakedbody with cold water is known to remove even pertinacious constipation ofthe bowels. From the quiescence of such extensive systems of vessels as theglands and capillaries of the skin, and the minute vessels of the lungs,with their various absorbent series of vessels, a great accumulation ofsensorial powers is occasioned; part of which is again expended in theincreased exertion of all these vessels, with an universal glow of heat inconsequence of this exertion, and the remainder of it adds vigour to boththe vital and voluntary exertions of the whole day."|FALSE
15707|"If the activity of the subcutaneous vessels, and of those with which theiractions are associated, was too great before cold immersion, as in the hotdays of summer, and by that means the sensorial power was previouslydiminished, we see the cause why the cold bath gives such present strength;namely, by stopping the unnecessary activity of the subcutaneous vessels,and thus preventing the too great exhaustion of sensorial power; which, inmetaphorical language, has been called _bracing_ the system: which is,however, a mechanical term, only applicable to drums, or musical strings:as on the contrary the word _relaxation_, when applied to living animalbodies, can only mean too small a quantity of stimulus, or too small aquantity of sensorial power; as explained in Sect. XII. 1."|FALSE
15707|"3. This experiment of cold bathing presents us with a simple fever-fit; forthe pulse is weak, small, and quick during the cold immersion; and becomesstrong, full, and quick during the subsequent glow of heat; till in a fewminutes these symptoms subside, and the temporary fever ceases."|FALSE
15707|"In those constitutions where the degree of inirritability, or of debility,is greater than natural, the coldness and paleness of the skin with thequick and weak pulse continue a long time after the patient leaves thebath; and the subsequent heat approaches by unequal flushings, and he feelshimself disordered for many hours. Hence the bathing in a cold spring ofwater, where the heat is but forty-eight degrees on Fahrenheit'sthermometer, much disagrees with those of weak or inirritable habits ofbody; who possess so little sensorial power, that they cannot withoutinjury bear to have it diminished even for a short time; but who cannevertheless bear the more temperate coldness of Buxton bath, which isabout eighty degrees of heat, and which strengthens them, and makes them byhabit less liable to great quiescence from small variations of cold, andthence less liable to be disordered by the unavoidable accidents of life.Hence it appears, why people of these inirritable constitutions, which isanother expression for sensorial deficiency, are often much injured bybathing in a cold spring of water; and why they should continue but a veryshort time in baths, which are colder than their bodies; and shouldgradually increase both the degree of coldness of the water, and the timeof their continuance in it, if they would obtain salutary effects from coldimmersions. See Sect. XII. 2. 1."|FALSE
15707|"On the other hand, in all cases where the heat of the external surface ofthe body, or of the internal surface of the lungs, is greater than natural,the use of exposure to cool air may be deduced. In fever-fits attended withstrength, that is with great quantity of sensorial power, it removes theadditional stimulus of heat from the surfaces above mentioned, and thusprevents their excess of useless motion; and in fever-fits attended withdebility, that is with a deficiency of the quantity of sensorial power, itprevents the great and dangerous waste of sensorial power expended in theunnecessary increase of the actions of the glands and capillaries of theskin and lungs."|FALSE
15707|"4. In the same manner, when any one is long exposed to very cold air, aquiescence is produced of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries andabsorbents, owing to the deficiency of their usual stimulus of heat; andthis quiescence of so great a quantity of vessels affects, by irritativeassociation, the whole absorbent and glandular system, which becomes in agreater or less degree quiescent, and a cold fit of fever is produced."|FALSE
15707|"If the deficiency of the stimulus of heat is very great, the quiescencebecomes so general as to extinguish life, as in those who are frozen todeath."|FALSE
15707|"If the deficiency of heat be in less degree, but yet so great as in somemeasure to disorder the system, and should occur the succeeding day, itwill induce a greater degree of quiescence than before, from its acting inconcurrence with the period of the diurnal circle of actions, explained inSect. XXXVI. Hence from a small beginning a greater and greater degree ofquiescence may be induced, till a complete fever-fit is formed; and whichwill continue to recur at the periods by which it was produced. See Sect.XVII. 3. 6."|FALSE
15707|"If the degree of quiescence occasioned by defect of the stimulus of heat bevery great, it will recur a second time by a slighter cause, than thatwhich first induced it. If the cause, which induces the second fit ofquiescence, recurs the succeeding day, the quotidian fever is produced; ifnot till the alternate day, the tertian fever; and if not till afterseventy-two hours from the first fit of quiescence, the quartan fever isformed. This last kind of fever recurs less frequently than the other, asit is a disease only of those of the temperament of associability, asmentioned in Sect. XXXI.; for in other constitutions the capability offorming a habit ceases, before the new cause of quiescence is againapplied, if that does not occur sooner than in seventy-two hours."|FALSE
15707|"And hence those fevers, whose cause is from cold air of the night ormorning, are more liable to observe the solar day in their periods; whilethose from other causes frequently observe the lunar day in their periods,their paroxysms returning near an hour later every day, as explained inSect. XXXVI."|FALSE
15707|"IV. Another frequent cause of the cold fits of fever is the defect of thestimulus of distention. The whole arterial system would appear, by theexperiments of Haller, to be irritable by no other stimulus, and themotions of the heart and alimentary canal are certainly in some measuredependant on the same cause. See Sect. XIV. 7. Hence there can be nowonder, that the diminution of distention should frequently induce thequiescence, which constitutes the beginning of fever-fits."|FALSE
15707|"Monsieur Leiutaud has judiciously mentioned the deficiency of the quantityof blood amongst the causes of diseases, which he says is frequentlyevident in dissections: fevers are hence brought on by great hæmorrhages,diarrhoeas, or other evacuations; or from the continued use of diet, whichcontains but little nourishment; or from the exhaustion occasioned byviolent fatigue, or by those chronic diseases in which the digestion ismuch impaired; as where the stomach has been long affected with the gout orschirrus; or in the paralysis of the liver, as described in Sect. XXX.Hence a paroxysm of gout is liable to recur on bleeding or purging; as thetorpor of some viscus, which precedes the inflammation of the foot, is thusinduced by the want of the stimulus of distention. And hence theextremities of the body, as the nose and fingers, are more liable to becomecold, when we have long abstained from food; and hence the pulse isincreased both in strength and velocity above the natural standard after afull meal by the stimulus of distention."|FALSE
15707|"However, this stimulus of distention, like the stimulus of heat abovedescribed, though it contributes much to the due action not only of theheart, arteries, and alimentary canal, but seems necessary to the propersecretion of all the various glands; yet perhaps it is not the sole causeof any of these numerous motions: for as the lacteals, cutaneousabsorbents, and the various glands appear to be stimulated into action bythe peculiar pungency of the fluids they absorb, so in the intestinal canalthe pungency of the digesting aliment, or the acrimony of the fæces, seemto contribute, as well as their bulk, to promote the peristaltic motions;and in the arterial system, the momentum of the particles of thecirculating blood, and their acrimony, stimulate the arteries, as well asthe distention occasioned by it. Where the pulse is small this defect ofdistention is present, and contributes much to produce the febrisirritativa pulsu debili, or irritative fever with weak pulse, called bymodern writers nervous fever, as a predisponent cause. See Sect. XII. 1. 4.Might not the transfusion of blood, suppose of four ounces daily from astrong man, or other healthful animal, as a sheep or an ass, be used in theearly state of nervous or putrid fevers with great prospect of success?"|FALSE
15707|"V. 1. The defect of the momentum of the particles of the circulating bloodis another cause of the quiescence, with which the cold fits of fevercommence. This stimulus of the momentum of the progressive particles of theblood does not act over the whole body like those of heat and distentionabove described, but is confined to the arterial system; and differs fromthe stimulus of the distention of the blood, as much as the vibration ofthe air does from the currents of it. Thus are the different organs of ourbodies stimulated by four different mechanic properties of the externalworld: the sense of touch by the pressure of solid bodies so as todistinguish their figure; the muscular system by the distention, which theyoccasion; the internal surface of the arteries, by the momentum of theirmoving particles; and the auditory nerves, by the vibration of them: andthese four mechanic properties are as different from each other as thevarious chemical ones, which are adapted to the numerous glands, and to theother organs of sense."|FALSE
15707|"2. The momentum of the progressive particles of blood is compounded oftheir velocity and their quantity of matter: hence whatever circumstancesdiminish either of these without proportionally increasing the other, andwithout superadding either of the general stimuli of heat or distention,will tend to produce a quiescence of the arterial system, and from thenceof all the other irritative motions, which are connected with it."|FALSE
15707|"Hence in all those constitutions or diseases where the blood contains agreater proportion of serum, which is the lightest part of its composition,the pulsations of the arteries are weaker, as in nervous fevers, chlorosis,and hysteric complaints; for in these cases the momentum of the progressiveparticles of blood is less: and hence, where the denser parts of itscomposition abound, as the red part of it, or the coagulable lymph, thearterial pulsations are stronger; as in those of robust health, and ininflammatory diseases."|FALSE
15707|"That this stimulus of the momentum of the particles of the circulatingfluid is of the greatest consequence to the arterial action, appears fromthe experiment of injecting air into the blood vessels, which seems todestroy animal life from the want of this stimulus of momentum; for thedistention of the arteries is not diminished by it, it possesses nocorrosive acrimony, and is less liable to repass the valves than the blooditself; since air-valves in all machinery require much less accuracy ofconstruction than those which are opposed to water."|FALSE
15707|"3. One method of increasing the velocity of the blood, and in consequencethe momentum of its particles, is by the exercise of the body, or by thefriction of its surface: so, on the contrary, too great indolencecontributes to decrease this stimulus of the momentum of the particles ofthe circulating blood, and thus tends to induce quiescence; as is seen inhysteric cases, and chlorosis, and the other diseases of sedentary people."|FALSE
15707|"4. The velocity of the particles of the blood in certain circumstances isincreased by venesection, which, by removing a part of it, diminishes theresistance to the motion of the other part, and hence the momentum of theparticles of it is increased. This may be easily understood by consideringit in the extreme, since, if the resistance was greatly increased, so as toovercome the propelling power, there could be no velocity, and inconsequence no momentum at all. From this circumstance arises that curiousphænomenon, the truth of which I have been more than once witness to, thatvenesection will often instantaneously relieve those nervous pains, whichattend the cold periods of hysteric, asthmatic, or epileptic diseases; andthat even where large doses of opium have been in vain exhibited. In thesecases the pulse becomes stronger after the bleeding, and the extremitiesregain their natural warmth; and an opiate then given acts with much morecertain effect."|FALSE
15707|"VI. There is another cause, which seems occasionally to induce quiescenceinto some part of our system, I mean the influence of the sun and moon; theattraction of these luminaries, by decreasing the gravity of the particlesof the blood, cannot affect their momentum, as their vis inertiæ remainsthe same; but it may nevertheless produce some chemical change in them,because whatever affects the general attractions of the particles of mattermay be supposed from analogy to affect their specific attractions oraffinities: and thus the stimulus of the particles of blood may bediminished, though not their momentum. As the tides of the sea obey thesouthing and northing of the moon (allowing for the time necessary fortheir motion, and the obstructions of the shores), it is probable, thatthere are also atmospheric tides on both sides of the earth, which to theinhabitants of another planet might so deflect the light as to resemble thering of Saturn. Now as these tides of water, or of air, are raised by thediminution of their gravity, it follows, that their pressure on the surfaceof the earth is no greater than the pressure of the other parts of theocean, or of the atmosphere, where no such tides exist; and therefore thatthey cannot affect the mercury in the barometer. In the same manner, thegravity of all other terrestrial bodies is diminished at the times of thesouthing and northing of the moon, and that in a greater degree when thiscoincides with the southing and northing of the sun, and this in a stillgreater degree about the times of the equinoxes. This decrease of thegravity of all bodies during the time the moon passes our zenith or nadirmight possibly be shewn by the slower vibrations of a pendulum, comparedwith a spring clock, or with astronomical observation. Since a pendulum ofa certain length moves slower at the line than near the poles, because thegravity being diminished and the vis inertiæ continuing the same, themotive power is less, but the resistance to be overcome continues the same.The combined powers of the lunar and solar attraction is estimated by SirIsaac Newton not to exceed one 7,868,850th part of the power ofgravitation, which seems indeed but a small circumstance to produce anyconsiderable effect on the weight of sublunary bodies, and yet this issufficient to raise the tides at the equator above ten feet high; and if itbe considered, what small impulses of other bodies produce their effects onthe organs of sense adapted to the perception of them, as of vibration onthe auditory nerves, we shall cease to to be surprised, that so minute adiminution in the gravity of the particles of blood should so far affecttheir chemical changes, or their stimulating quality, as, joined with othercauses, sometimes to produce the beginnings of diseases."|FALSE
15707|"Add to this, that if the lunar influence produces a very small degree ofquiescence at first, and if that recurs at certain periods even with lesspower to produce quiescence than at first, yet the quiescence will dailyincrease by the acquired habit acting at the same time, till at length sogreat a degree of quiescence is induced as to produce phrensy, caninemadness, epilepsy, hysteric pains or cold fits of fever, instances of manyof which are to be found in Dr. Mead's work on this subject. The solarinfluence also appears daily in several diseases; but as darkness, silence,sleep, and our periodical meals mark the parts of the solar circle ofactions, it is sometimes dubious to which of these the periodical returnsof these diseases are to be ascribed."|FALSE
15707|"As far as I have been able to observe, the periods of inflammatory diseasesobserve the solar day; as the gout and rheumatism have their greatestquiescence about noon and midnight, and their exacerbations some hoursafter; as they have more frequently their immediate cause from cold air,inanition, or fatigue, than from the effects of lunations: whilst the coldfits of hysteric patients, and those in nervous fevers, more frequentlyoccur twice a day, later by near half an hour each time, according to thelunar day; whilst some fits of intermittents, which are undisturbed bymedicines, return at regular solar periods, and others at lunar ones; whichmay, probably, be owing to the difference of the periods of those externalcircumstances of cold, inanition, or lunation, which immediately causedthem."|FALSE
15707|"We must, however, observe, that the periods of quiescence and exacerbationin diseases do not always commence at the times of the syzygies orquadratures of the moon and sun, or at the times of their passing thezenith or nadir; but as it is probable, that the stimulus of the particlesof the circumfluent blood is gradually diminished from the time of thequadratures to that of the syzygies, the quiescence may commence at anyhour, when co-operating with other causes of quiescence, it becomes greatenough to produce a disease: afterwards it will continue to recur at thesame period of the lunar or solar influence; the same cause operatingconjointly with the acquired habit, that is with the catenation of this newmotion with the dissevered links of the lunar or solar circles of animalaction."|FALSE
15707|"In this manner the periods of menstruation obey the lunar month with greatexactness in healthy patients (and perhaps the venereal orgasm in bruteanimals does the same), yet these periods do not commence either at thesyzygies or quadratures of the lunations, but at whatever time of the lunarperiods they begin, they observe the same in their returns till somegreater cause disturbs them."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, though the best way to calculate the time of the expected returns ofthe paroxysms of periodical diseases is to count the number of hoursbetween the commencement of the two preceding fits, yet the followingobservations may be worth attending to, when we endeavour to prevent thereturns of maniacal or epileptic diseases; whose periods (at the beginningof them especially) frequently observe the syzygies of the moon and sun,and particularly about the equinox."|FALSE
15707|"The greatest of the two tides happening in every revolution of the moon, isthat when the moon approaches nearest to the zenith or nadir; for thisreason, while the sun is in the northern signs, that is during the vernaland summer months, the greater of the two diurnal tides in our latitude isthat, when the moon is above the horizon; and when the sun is in thesouthern signs, or during the autumnal and winter months, the greater tideis that, which arises when the moon is below the horizon: and as the sunapproaches somewhat nearer the earth in winter than in summer, the greatestequinoctial tides are observed to be a little before the vernal equinox,and a little after the autumnal one."|FALSE
15707|"Do not the cold periods of lunar diseases commence a few hours before thesouthing of the moon during the vernal and summer months, and before thenorthing of the moon during the autumnal and winter months? Do not palsiesand apoplexies, which occur about the equinoxes, happen a few days beforethe vernal equinoctial lunation, and after the autumnal one? Are not theperiods of those diurnal diseases more obstinate, that commence many hoursbefore the southing or northing of the moon, than of those which commenceat those times? Are not those palsies and apoplexies more dangerous whichcommence many days before the syzygies of the moon, than those which happenat those times? See Sect. XXXVI. on the periods of diseases."|FALSE
15707|"VII. Another very frequent cause of the cold fit of fever is the quiescenceof some of those large congeries of glands, which compose the liver,spleen, or pancreas; one or more of which are frequently so enlarged in theautumnal intermittents as to be perceptible to the touch externally, andare called by the vulgar ague-cakes. As these glands are stimulated intoaction by the specific pungency of the fluids, which they absorb, thegeneral cause of their quiescence seems to be the too great insipidity ofthe fluids of the body, co-operating perhaps at the same time with othergeneral causes of quiescence."|FALSE
15707|"Hence, in marshy countries at cold seasons, which have succeeded hot ones,and amongst those, who have lived on innutritious and unstimulating diet,these agues are most frequent. The enlargement of these quiescent viscera,and the swelling of the præcordia in many other fevers, is, most probably,owing to the same cause; which may consist in a general deficiency of theproduction of sensorial power, as well as in the diminished stimulation ofthe fluids; and when the quiescence of so great a number of glands, asconstitute one of those large viscera, commences, all the other irritativemotions are affected by their connection with it, and the cold fit of feveris produced."|FALSE
15707|"VIII. There are many other causes, which produce quiescence of some part ofthe animal system, as fatigue, hunger, thirst, bad diet, disappointed love,unwholesome air, exhaustion from evacuations, and many others; but the lastcause, that we shall mention, as frequently productive of cold fits offever, is fear or anxiety of mind. The pains, which we are first and mostgenerally acquainted with, have been produced by defect of some stimulus;thus, soon after our nativity we become acquainted with the pain from thecoldness of the air, from the want of respiration, and from the want offood. Now all these pains occasioned by defect of stimulus are attendedwith quiescence of the organ, and at the same time with a greater or lessdegree of quiescence of other parts of the system: thus, if we even endurethe pain of hunger so as to miss one meal instead of our daily habit ofrepletion, not only the peristaltic motions of the stomach and bowels arediminished, but we are more liable to coldness of our extremities, as ofour noses, and ears, and feet, than at other times."|FALSE
15707|"Now, as fear is originally excited by our having experienced pain, and isitself a painful affection, the same quiescence of other fibrous motionsaccompany it, as have been most frequently connected with this kind ofpain, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 1. as the coldness and paleness of theskin, trembling, difficult respiration, indigestion, and other symptoms,which contribute to form the cold fit of fevers. Anxiety is fear continuedthrough a longer time, and, by producing chronical torpor of the system,extinguishes life slowly, by what is commonly termed a broken heart."|FALSE
15707|"IX. 1. We now step forwards to consider the other symptoms in consequenceof the quiescence which begins the fits of fever. If by any of thecircumstances before described, or by two or more of them acting at thesame time, a great degree of quiescence is induced on any considerable partof the circle of irritative motions, the whole class of them is more orless disturbed by their irritative associations. If this torpor beoccasioned by a deficient supply of sensorial power, and happens to any ofthose parts of the system, which are accustomed to perpetual activity, asthe vital motions, the torpor increases rapidly, because of the greatexpenditure of sensorial power by the incessant activity of those parts ofthe system, as shewn in No. 3. 2. of this Section. Hence a deficiency ofall the secretions succeeds, and as animal heat is produced in proportionto the quantity of those secretions, the coldness of the skin is the firstcircumstance, which is attended to. Dr. Martin asserts, that some parts ofhis body were warmer than natural in the cold fit of fever; but it iscertain, that those, which are uncovered, as the fingers, and nose, andears, are much colder to the touch, and paler in appearance. It ispossible, that his experiments were made at the beginning of the subsequenthot fits; which commence with partial distributions of heat, owing to someparts of the body regaining their natural irritability sooner than others."|FALSE
15707|"From the quiescence of the anastomosing capillaries a paleness of the skinsucceeds, and a less secretion of the perspirable matter; from thequiescence of the pulmonary capillaries a difficulty of respiration arises;and from the quiescence of the other glands less bile, less gastric andpancreatic juice, are secreted into the stomach and intestines, and lessmucus and saliva are poured into the mouth; whence arises the dry tongue,costiveness, dry ulcers, and paucity of urine. From the quiescence of theabsorbent system arises the great thirst, as less moisture is absorbed fromthe atmosphere. The absorption from the atmosphere was observed by Dr.Lyster to amount to eighteen ounces in one night, above what he had at thesame time insensibly perspired. See Langrish. On the same account the urineis pale, though in small quantity, for the thinner part is not absorbedfrom it; and when repeated ague-fits continue long, the legs swell from thediminished absorption of the cellular absorbents."|FALSE
15707|"From the quiescence of the intestinal canal a loss of appetite andflatulencies proceed. From the partial quiescence of the glandular visceraa swelling and tension about the præcordia becomes sensible to the touch;which is occasioned by the delay of the fluids from the defect of venous orlymphatic absorption. The pain of the forehead, and of the limbs, and ofthe small of the back, arises from the quiescence of the membranous fascia,or muscles of those parts, in the same manner as the skin becomes painful,when the vessels, of which it is composed, become quiescent from cold. Thetrembling in consequence of the pain of coldness, the restlessness, and theyawning, and stretching of the limbs, together with the shuddering, orrigours, are convulsive motions; and will be explained amongst the diseasesof volition; Sect. XXXIV."|FALSE
15707|"Sickness and vomiting is a frequent symptom in the beginnings offever-fits, the muscular fibres of the stomach share the general torpor anddebility of the system; their motions become first lessened, and then stop,and then become retrograde; for the act of vomiting, like the globushystericus and the borborigmi of hypochondriasis, is always a symptom ofdebility, either from want of stimulus, as in hunger; or from want ofsensorial power, as after intoxication; or from sympathy with some othertorpid irritative motions, as in the cold fits of ague. See Sect. XII. 5.5. XXIX. 11. and XXXV. 1. 3. where this act of vomiting is furtherexplained."|FALSE
15707|"The small pulse, which is said by some writers to be slow at thecommencement of ague-fits, and which is frequently trembling andintermittent, is owing to the quiescence of the heart and arterial system,and to the resistance opposed to the circulating fluid from the inactivityof all the glands and capillaries. The great weakness and inability tovoluntary motions, with the insensibility of the extremities, are owing tothe general quiescence of the whole moving system; or, perhaps, simply tothe deficient production of sensorial power."|FALSE
15707|"If all these symptoms are further increased, the quiescence of all themuscles, including the heart and arteries, becomes complete, and deathensues. This is, most probably, the case of those who are starved to deathwith cold, and of those who are said to die in Holland from long skaitingon their frozen canals."|FALSE
15707|"2. As soon as this general quiescence of the system ceases, either by thediminution of the cause, or by the accumulation of sensorial power, (as insyncope, Sect. XII. 7. 1.) which is the natural consequence of previousquiescence, the hot fit commences. Every gland of the body is nowstimulated into stronger action than is natural, as its irritability isincreased by accumulation of sensorial power during its late quiescence, asuperabundance of all the secretions is produced, and an increase of heatin consequence of the increase of these secretions. The skin becomes red,and the perspiration great, owing to the increased action of thecapillaries during the hot part of the paroxysm. The secretion ofperspirable matter is perhaps greater during the hot fit than in thesweating fit which follows; but as the absorption of it also is greater, itdoes not stand on the skin in visible drops: add to this, that theevaporation of it also is greater, from the increased heat of the skin. Butat the decline of the hot fit, as the mouths of the absorbents of the skinare exposed to the cooler air, or bed-clothes, these vessels sooner losetheir increased activity, and cease to absorb more than their naturalquantity: but the secerning vessels for some time longer, being kept warmby the circulating blood, continue to pour out an increased quantity ofperspirable matter, which now stands on the skin in large visible drops;the exhalation of it also being lessened by the greater coolness of theskin, as well as its absorption by the diminished action of the lymphatics.See Class I. 1. 2. 3."|FALSE
15707|"The increased secretion of bile and of other fluids poured into theintestines frequently induce a purging at the decline of the hot fit; foras the external absorbent vessels have their mouths exposed to the coldair, as above mentioned, they cease to be excited into unnatural activitysooner than the secretory vessels, whose mouths are exposed to the warmthof the blood: now, as the internal absorbents sympathize with the externalones, these also, which during the hot fit drank up the thinner part of thebile, or of other secreted fluids, lose their increased activity before thegland loses its increased activity, at the decline of the hot fit; and theloose dejections are produced from the same cause, that the increasedperspiration stands on the surface of the skin, from the increasedabsorption ceasing sooner than the increased secretion."|FALSE
15707|"The urine during the cold fit is in small quantity and pale, both from adeficiency of the secretion and a deficiency of the absorption."|FALSE
15707|"During the hot fit it is in its usual quantity, but very high coloured andturbid, because a greater quantity had been secreted by the increasedaction of the kidnies, and also a greater quantity of its more aqueous parthad been absorbed from it in the bladder by the increased action of theabsorbents; and lastly, at the decline of the hot fit it is in largequantity and less coloured, or turbid, because the absorbent vessels of thebladder, as observed above, lose their increased action by sympathy withthe cutaneous ones sooner than the secretory vessels of the kidnies losetheir increased activity. Hence the quantity of the sediment, and thecolour of the urine, in fevers, depend much on the quantity secreted by thekidnies, and the quantity absorbed from it again in the bladder: the kindsof sediment, as the lateritious, purulent, mucous, or bloody sediments,depend on other causes. It should be observed, that if the sweating beincreased by the heat of the room, or of the bed-clothes, that a paucity ofturbid urine will continue to be produced, as the absorbents of the bladderwill have their activity increased by their sympathy with the vessels ofthe skin, for the purpose of supplying the fluid expended in perspiration."|FALSE
15707|"The pulse becomes strong and full owing to the increased irritability ofthe heart and arteries, from the accumulation of sensorial power duringtheir quiescence, and to the quickness of the return of the blood from thevarious glands and capillaries. This increased action of all the secretoryvessels does not occur very suddenly, nor universally at the same time. Theheat seems to begin about the center, and to be diffused from thenceirregularly to the other parts of the system. This may be owing to thesituation of the parts which first became quiescent and caused thefever-fit, especially when a hardness or tumour about the præcordia can befelt by the hand; and hence this part, in whatever viscus it is seated,might be the first to regain its natural or increased irritability."|FALSE
15707|"3. It must be here noted, that, by the increased quantity of heat, and ofthe impulse of the blood at the commencement of the hot fit, a greatincrease of stimulus is induced, and is now added to the increasedirritability of the system, which was occasioned by its previousquiescence. This additional stimulus of heat and momentum of the bloodaugments the violence of the movements of the arterial and glandular systemin an increasing ratio. These violent exertions still producing more heatand greater momentum of the moving fluids, till at length the sensoralpower becomes wasted by this great stimulus beneath its natural quantity,and predisposes the system to a second cold fit."|FALSE

15707|"4. But if the increase of irritability, and the consequent increase of thestimulus of heat and momentum, produce more violent exertions than thoseabove described; great pain arises in some part of the moving system, as inthe membranes of the brain, pleura, or joints; and new motions of thevessels are produced in consequence of this pain, which are calledinflammation; or delirium or stupor arises; as explained in Sect. XXI. andXXXIII.: for the immediate effect is the same, whether the great energy ofthe moving organs arises from an increase of stimulus or an increase ofirritability; though in the former case the waste of sensorial power leadsto debility, and in the latter to health."|FALSE

Those muscles, which are less frequently exerted, and whose actions areinterrupted by sleep, acquire less accumulation of sensorial power duringtheir quiescent state, as the muscles of locomotion. In these muscles aftergreat exertion, that is, after great exhaustion of sensorial power, thepain of fatigue ensues; and during rest there is a renovation of thenatural quantity of sensorial power; but where the rest, or quiescence ofthe muscle, is long continued, a quantity of sensorial power becomesaccumulated beyond what is necessary; as appears by the uneasinessoccasioned by want of exercise; and which in young animals is one causeexciting them into action, as is seen in the play of puppies and kittens."|FALSE
15707|"But when those muscles, which are habituated to perpetual actions, as thoseof the stomach by the stimulus of food, those of the vessels of the skin bythe stimulus of heat, and those which constitute the arteries and glands bythe stimulus of the blood, become for a time quiescent, from the want oftheir appropriated stimuli, or by their associations with other quiescentparts of the system; a greater accumulation of sensorial power is acquiredduring their quiescence, and a greater or quicker exhaustion of it isproduced during their increased action."|FALSE
15707|"This accumulation of sensorial power from deficient action, if it happensto the stomach from want of food, occasions the pain of hunger; if ithappens to the vessels of the skin from want of heat, it occasions the painof cold; and if to the arterial system from the want of its adaptedstimuli, many disagreeable sensations are occasioned, such as areexperienced in the cold fits of intermittent fevers, and are as various, asthere are glands or membranes in the system, and are generally termeduniversal uneasiness."|FALSE
15707|"When the quiescence of the arterial system is not owing to defect ofstimulus as above, but to the defective quantity of sensorial power, as inthe commencement of nervous fever, or irritative fever with weak pulse, agreat torpor of this system is quickly induced; because both the irritationfrom the stimulus of the blood, and the association of the vascular motionswith each other, continue to excite the arteries into action, and thencequickly exhaust the ill-supplied vascular muscles; for to rest is death;and therefore those vascular muscles continue to proceed, though withfeebler action, to the extreme of weariness or faintness: while nothingsimilar to this affects the locomotive muscles, whose actions are generallycaused by volition, and not much subject either to irritation or to otherkinds of associations besides the voluntary ones, except indeed when theyare excited by the lash of slavery."|FALSE
15707|"In these vascular muscles, which are subject to perpetual action, andthence liable to great accumulation of sensorial power during theirquiescence from want of stimulus, a great increase of activity occurs,either from the renewal of their accustomed stimulus, or even from muchless quantities of stimulus than usual. This increase of action constitutesthe hot fit of fever, which is attended with various increased secretions,with great concomitant heat, and general uneasiness. The uneasinessattending this hot paroxysm of fever, or fit of exertion, is very differentfrom that, which attends the previous cold fit, or fit of quiescence, andis frequently the cause of inflammation, as in pleurisy, which is treatedof in the next section."|FALSE
15707|"A similar effect occurs after the quiescence of our organs of sense; thosewhich are not subject to perpetual action, as the taste and smell, are lessliable to an exuberant accumulation of sensorial power after their havingfor a time been inactive; but the eye, which is in perpetual action duringthe day, becomes dazzled, and liable to inflammation after a temporaryquiescence."|FALSE
15707|"Where the previous quiescence has been owing to a defect of sensorialpower, and not to a defect of stimulus, as in the irritative fever withweak pulse, a similar increase of activity of the arterial system succeeds,either from the usual stimulus of the blood, or from a stimulus less thanusual; but as there is in general in these cases of fever with weak pulse adeficiency of the quantity of the blood, the pulse in the hot fit is weakerthan in health, though it is stronger than in the cold fit, as explained inNo. 2. of this section. But at the same time in those fevers, where thedefect of irritation is owing to the defect of the quantity of sensorialpower, as well as to the defect of stimulus, another circumstance occurs;which consists in the partial distribution of it, as appears in partialflushings, as of the face or bosom, while the extremities are cold; and inthe increase of particular secretions, as of bile, saliva, insensibleperspiration, with great heat of the skin, or with partial sweats, ordiarrhoea."|FALSE
15707|"There are also many uneasy sensations attending these increased actions,which, like those belonging to the hot fit of fever with strong pulse, arefrequently followed by inflammation, as in scarlet fever; whichinflammation is nevertheless accompanied with a pulse weaker, thoughquicker, than the pulse during the remission or intermission of theparoxysms, though stronger than that of the previous cold fit."|FALSE
15707|"From hence I conclude, that both the cold and hot fits of fever arenecessary consequences of the perpetual and incessant action of thearterial and glandular system; since those muscular fibres and those organsof sense, which are most frequently exerted, become necessarily mostaffected both with defect and accumulation of sensorial power: and thathence _fever-fits are not an effort of nature to relieve herself_, and thattherefore they should always be prevented or diminished as much aspossible, by any means which decrease the general or partial vascularactions, when they are greater, or by increasing them when they are lessthan in health, as described in Sect.

As many motions of the body are excited and continued by irritations,so others require, either conjunctly with these, or separately, thepleasurable or painful sensations, for the purpose of producing them withdue energy. Amongst these the business of digestion supplies us with aninstance: if the food, which we swallow, is not attended with agreeablesensation, it digests less perfectly; and if very disagreeable sensationaccompanies it, such as a nauseous idea, or very disgustful taste, thedigestion becomes impeded; or retrograde motions of the stomach andoesophagus succeed, and the food is ejected."|FALSE

Besides the febrile motions occasioned by irritation, described in Sect.XXXII. and termed irritative fever, it frequently happens that pain isexcited by the violence of the fibrous contractions; and other new motionsare then superadded, in consequence of sensation, which we shall termfebris sensitiva, or sensitive fever. It must be observed, that mostirritative fevers begin with a decreased exertion of irritation, owing todefect of stimulus; but that on the contrary the sensitive fevers, orinflammations, generally begin with the increased exertion of sensation, asmentioned in Sect. XXXI. on temperaments: for though the cold fit, whichintroduces inflammation, commences with decreased irritation, yet theinflammation itself commences in the hot fit during the increase ofsensation. Thus a common pustule, or phlegmon, in a part of littlesensibility does not excite an inflammatory fever; but if the stomach,intestines, or the tender substance beneath the nails, be injured, greatsensation is produced, and the whole system is thrown into that kind ofexertion, which constitutes inflammation."|FALSE

In these cases the voluntary power first ceases toact from deficiency of sensorial spirit; and the stimuli from externalbodies have no effect on the exhausted sensorial power, and a delirium likea dream is the consequence. At length the internal stimuli cease to excitesufficient irritation, and the secretions are either not produced at all,or too parsimonious in quantity. Amongst these the secretion of the brain,or production of the sensorial power, becomes deficient, till at last allsensorial power ceases, except what is just necessary to perform the vitalmotions, and a stupor succeeds; which is thus owing to the same cause asthe preceding delirium exerted in a greater degree."|FALSE
15707|"This kind of delirium is owing to a suspension of volition, and to thedisobedience of the senses to external stimuli, and is always occasioned bygreat debility, or paucity of sensorial power; it is therefore a bad signat the end of inflammatory fevers, which had previous arterial strength, asrheumatism, or pleurisy, as it shews the presence of great exhaustion ofsensorial power in a system, which having lately been exposed to greatexcitement, is not so liable to be stimulated into its healthy action,either by additional stimulus of food and medicines, or by the accumulationof sensorial power during its present torpor. In inflammatory fevers withdebility, as those termed putrid fevers, delirium is sometimes, as well asstupor, rather a favourable sign; as less sensorial power is wasted duringits continuance (see Class II. 1. 6. 8.), and the constitution not havingbeen previously exposed to excess of stimulation, is more liable to beexcited after previous quiescence."|FALSE
15707|"When the sum of general pleasurable sensation becomes too great, anotherkind of delirium supervenes, and the ideas thus excited are mistaken forthe irritations of external objects: such a delirium is produced for a timeby intoxicating drugs, as fermented liquors, or opium: a permanent deliriumof this kind is sometimes induced by the pleasures of inordinate vanity, orby the enthusiastic hopes of heaven. In these cases the power of volitionis incapable of exertion, and in a great degree the external senses becomeincapable of perceiving their adapted stimuli, because the whole sensorialpower is employed or expended on the ideas excited by pleasurablesensation."|FALSE
15707|"This kind of delirium is distinguished from that which attends the feversabove mentioned from its not being accompanied with general debility, butsimply with excess of pleasurable sensation; and is therefore in somemeasure allied to madness or to reverie; it differs from the delirium ofdreams, as in this the power of volition is not totally suspended, nor arethe senses precluded from external stimulation; there is therefore a degreeof consistency, in this kind of delirium, and a degree of attention toexternal objects, neither of which exist in the delirium of fevers or indreams."|FALSE
15707|"5. It would appear, that the vascular system of other animals are lessliable to be put into action by their general sum of pleasurable or painfulsensation; and that the trains of their ideas, and the muscular motionsusually associated with them, are less powerfully connected than in thehuman system. For other animals neither weep, nor smile, nor laugh; and arehence seldom subject to delirium, as treated of in Sect. XVI. on Instinct.Now as our epidemic and contagious diseases are probably produced bydisagreeable sensation, and not simply by irritation; there appears areason, why brute animals are less liable to epidemic or contagiousdiseases; and secondly, why none of our contagions, as the small-pox ormeasles, can be communicated to them, though one of theirs, viz. thehydrophobia, as well as many of their poisons, as those of snakes and of ininsects, communicate their deleterious or painful effects to mankind."|FALSE
15707|"Where the quantity of general painful sensation is too great in the system,inordinate voluntary exertions are produced either of our ideas, as inmelancholy and madness, or of our muscles, as in convulsion. From thesemaladies also brute animals are much more exempt than mankind, owing totheir greater inaptitude to voluntary exertion, as mentioned in Sect. XVI.on Instinct."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. When any moving organ is excited into such violent motions, that aquantity of pleasurable or painful sensation is produced, it frequentlyhappens (but not always) that new motions of the affected organ aregenerated in consequence of the pain or pleasure, which are termedinflammation."|FALSE
15707|"These new motions are of a peculiar kind, tending to distend the old, andto produce new fibres, and thence to elongate the straight muscles, whichserve locomotion, and to form new vessels at the extremities or sides ofthe vascular muscles."|FALSE
15707|"2. Thus the pleasurable sensations produce an enlargement of the nipples ofnurses, of the papillæ of the tongue, of the penis, and probably producethe growth of the body from its embryon state to its maturity; whilst thenew motions in consequence of painful sensation, with the growth of thefibres or vessels, which they occasion, are termed inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"Hence when the straight muscles are inflamed, part of their tendons at eachextremity gain new life and sensibility, and thus the muscle is for a timeelongated; and inflamed bones become soft, vascular, and sensible. Thus newvessels shoot over the cornea of inflamed eyes, and into scirrhous tumours,when they become inflamed; and hence all inflamed parts grow together byintermixture, and inosculation of the new and old vessels."|FALSE
15707|"The heat is occasioned from the increased secretions either of mucus, or ofthe fibres, which produce or elongate the vessels. The red colour is owingto the pellucidity of the newly formed vessels, and as the arterial partsof them are probably formed before their correspondent venous parts."|FALSE
15707|"3. These new motions are excited either from the increased quantity ofsensation in consequence of greater fibrous contractions, or from increasedsensibility, that is, from the increased quantity of sensorial power in themoving organ. Hence they are induced by great external stimuli, as bywounds, broken bones; and by acrid or infectious materials; or by commonstimuli on those organs, which have been some time quiescent; as the usuallight of the day inflames the eyes of those, who have been confined indungeons; and the warmth of a common fire inflames those, who have beenpreviously exposed to much cold."|FALSE
15707|"But these new motions are never generated by that pain, which arises fromdefect of stimulus, as from hunger, thirst, cold, or inanition, with allthose pains, which are termed nervous. Where these pains exist, the motionsof the affected part are lessened; and if inflammation succeeds, it is insome distant parts; as coughs are caused by coldness and moisture beinglong applied to the feet; or it is in consequence of the renewal of thestimulus, as of heat or food, which excites our organs into stronger actionafter their temporary quiescence; as kibed heels after walking in snow."|FALSE
15707|"4. But when these new motions of the vascular muscles are exerted withgreater violence, and these vessels are either elongated too much or toohastily, a new material is secreted from their extremities, which is ofvarious kinds according to the peculiar animal motions of this new kind ofgland, which secretes it; such is the pus laudabile or common matter, thevariolous matter, venereal matter, catarrhous matter, and many others."|FALSE
15707|"5. These matters are the product of an animal process; they are secreted orproduced from the blood by certain diseased motions of the extremities ofthe blood-vessels, and are on that account all of them contagious; for if aportion of any of these matters is transmitted into the circulation, orperhaps only inserted into the skin, or beneath the cuticle of an healthyperson, its stimulus in a certain time produces the same kind of morbidmotions, by which itself was produced; and hence a similar kind isgenerated. See Sect. XXXIX. 6. 1."|FALSE
15707|"6. It is remarkable, that many of these contagious matters are capable ofproducing a similar disease but once; as the small-pox and measles; and Isuppose this is true of all those contagious diseases, which arespontaneously cured by nature in a certain time; for if the body wascapable of receiving the disease a second time, the patient mustperpetually infect himself by the very matter, which he has himselfproduced, and is lodged about him; and hence he could never become freefrom the disease. Something similar to this is seen in the secondary feverof the confluent small-pox; there is a great absorption of variolousmatter, a very minute part of which would give the genuine small-pox toanother person; but here it only stimulates the system into common fever;like that which common puss, or any other acrid material might occasion."|FALSE
15707|"7. In the pulmonary consumption, where common matter is daily absorbed, anirritative fever only, without new inflammation, is generally produced;which is terminated like other irritative fevers by sweats, or loosestools. Hence it does not appear, that this absorbed matter always acts asa contagious material producing fresh inflammation or new abscesses. Thoughthere is reason to believe, that the first time any common matter isabsorbed, it has this effect, but not the second time, like the variolousmatter above mentioned."|FALSE
15707|"This accounts for the opinion, that the pulmonary consumption is sometimesinfectious, which opinion was held by the ancients, and continues in Italyat present; and I have myself seen three or four instances, where a husbandand wife, who have slept together, and have thus much received each other'sbreath, who have infected each other, and both died in consequence of theoriginal taint of only one of them. This also accounts for the abscesses invarious parts of the body, that are sometimes produced after the inoculatedsmall-pox is terminated; for this second absorption of variolous matteracts like common matter, and produces only irritative fever in thosechildren, whose constitutions have already experienced the absorption ofcommon matter; and inflammation with a tendency to produce new abscesses inthose, whose constitutions have not experienced the absorptions of commonmatter."|FALSE
15707|"It is probable, that more certain proofs might have been found to shew,that common matter is infectious the first time it is absorbed, tending toproduce similar abscesses, but not the second time of its absorption, ifthis subject had been attended to."|FALSE
15707|"8. These contagious diseases are very numerous, as the plague, small-pox,chicken-pox, measles, scarlet-fever, pemphigus, catarrh, chincough,venereal disease, itch, trichoma, tinea. The infectious material does notseem to be dissolved by the air, but only mixed with it perhaps in finepowder, which soon subsides; since many of these contagions can only bereceived by actual contact; and others of them only at small distances fromthe infected person; as is evident from many persons having been nearpatients of the small-pox without acquiring the disease."|FALSE
15707|"The reason, why many of these diseases are received but once, and othersrepeatedly, is not well understood; it appears to me, that the constitutionbecomes so accustomed to the stimuli of these infectious materials, byhaving once experienced them, that though irritative motions, as hecticfevers, may again be produced by them, yet no sensation, and in consequenceno general inflammation succeeds; as disagreeable smells or tastes by habitcease to be perceived; they continue indeed to excite irritative ideas onthe organs of sense, but these are not succeeded by sensation."|FALSE
15707|"There are many irritative motions, which were at first succeeded bysensation, but which by frequent repetition cease to excite sensation, asexplained in Sect. XX. on Vertigo. And, that this circumstance exists inrespect to infectious matter appears from a known fact; that nurses, whohave had the small-pox, are liable to experience small ulcers on their armsby the contact of variolous matter in lifting their patients; and that whenpatients, who have formerly had the small-pox have been inoculated in thearm, a phlegmon, or inflamed sore, has succeeded, but no subsequent fever.Which shews, that the contagious matter of the small-pox has not lost itspower of stimulating the part it is applied to, but that the general systemis not affected in consequence. See Section XII. 7. 6. XIX. 9."|FALSE
15707|"9. From the accounts of the plague, virulent catarrh, and putrid dysentery,it seems uncertain, whether these diseases are experienced more than once;but the venereal disease and itch are doubtless repeatedly infectious; andas these diseases are never cured spontaneously, but require medicines,which act without apparent operation, some have suspected, that thecontagious material produces similar matter rather by a chemical change ofthe fluids, than by an animal process; and that the specific medicinesdestroy their virus by chemically combining with it. This opinion issuccessfully combated by Mr. Hunter, in his Treatise on Venereal Disease,Part I. c. i."|FALSE
15707|"But this opinion wants the support of analogy, as there is no known processin animal bodies, which is purely chemical, not even digestion; nor can anyof these matters be produced by chemical processes. Add to this, that it isprobable, that the insects, observed in the pustules of the itch, and inthe stools of dysenteric patients, are the consequences, and not the causesof these diseases. And that the specific medicines, which cure the itch andlues venerea, as brimstone and mercury, act only by increasing theabsorption of the matter in the ulcuscles of those diseases, and thencedisposing them to heal; which would otherwise continue to spread."|FALSE
15707|"Why the venereal disease, and itch, and tenia, or scald head, arerepeatedly contagious, while those contagions attended with fever can bereceived but once, seems to depend on their being rather local diseasesthan universal ones, and are hence not attended with fever, except thepurulent fever in their last stages, when the patient is destroyed by them.On this account the whole of the system does not become habituated to thesemorbid actions, so as to cease to be affected with sensation by arepetition of the contagion. Thus the contagious matter of the venerealdisease, and of the tenia, affects the lymphatic glands, as the inquinalglands, and those about the roots of the hair and neck, where it isarrested, but does not seem to affect the blood-vessels, since no feverensues."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it would appear, that these kinds of contagion are propagated not bymeans of the circulation, but by sympathy of distant parts with each other;since if a distant part, as the palate, should be excited by sensitiveassociation into the same kind of motions, as the parts originally affectedby the contact of infectious matter; that distant part will produce thesame kind of infectious matter; for every secretion from the blood isformed from it by the peculiar motions of the fine extremities of thegland, which secretes it; the various secreted fluids, as the bile, saliva,gastric juice, not previously existing, as such, in the blood-vessels."|FALSE
15707|"And this peculiar sympathy between the genitals and the throat, owing tosensitive association, appears not only in the production of venerealulcers in the throat, but in variety of other instances, as in the mumps,in the hydrophobia, some coughs, strangulation, the production of thebeard, change of voice at puberty. Which are further described in Class IV.1. 2. 7."|FALSE
15707|"To evince that the production of such large quantities of contagiousmatter, as are seen in some variolous patients, so as to cover the wholeskin almost with pustules, does not arise from any chemical fermentation inthe blood, but that it is owing to morbid motions of the fine extremitiesof the capillaries, or glands, whether these be ruptured or not, appearsfrom the quantity of this matter always corresponding with the quantity ofthe fever; that is, with the violent exertions of those glands andcapillaries, which are the terminations of the arterial system."|FALSE
15707|"The truth of this theory is evinced further by a circumstance observed byMr. J. Hunter, in his Treatise on Venereal Disease; that in a patient, whowas inoculated for the small-pox, and who appeared afterwards to have beenpreviously infested with the measles, the progress of the small-pox wasdelayed till the measles had run their course, and that then the small-poxwent through its usual periods."|FALSE
15707|"Two similar cases fell under my care, which I shall here relate, as itconfirms that of Mr. Hunter, and contributes to illustrate this part of thetheory of contagious diseases. I have transcribed the particulars from aletter of Mr. Lightwood of Yoxal, the surgeon who daily attended them, andat my request, after I had seen them, kept a kind of journal of theircases."|FALSE
15707|"Miss H. and Miss L. two sisters, the one about four and the other aboutthree years old, were inoculated Feb. 7, 1791. On the 10th there was aredness on both arms discernible by a glass. On the 11th their arms were somuch inflamed as to leave no doubt of the infection having taken place. Onthe 12th less appearance of inflammation on their arms. In the evening MissL. had an eruption, which resembled the measles. On the 12th the eruptionon Miss L. was very full on the face and breast, like the measles, withconsiderable fever. It was now known, that the measles were in a farm housein the neighbourhood. Miss H.'s arm less inflamed than yesterday. On the14th Miss L.'s fever great, and the eruption universal. The arm appears tobe healed. Miss H.'s arm somewhat redder. They were now put into separaterooms. On the 15th Miss L.'s arms as yesterday. Eruption continues. MissH.'s arms have varied but little. 16th, the eruptions on Miss L. are dyingaway, her fever gone. Begins to have a little redness in one arm at theplace of inoculation. Miss H.'s arms get redder, but she has no appearanceof complaint. 20th, Miss L.'s arms have advanced slowly till this day, andnow a few pustules appear. Miss H.'s arm has made little progress from the16th to this day, and now she has some fever. 21st, Miss L. as yesterday.Miss H. has much inflammation, and an increase of the red circle on one armto the size of half a crown, and had much fever at night, with fetidbreath. 22d, Miss L.'s pustules continue advancing.

Does not thisgive an idea, that if they were both inoculated at the same time, thatneither of them might affect the patient?"|FALSE
15707|"From these cases I contend, that the contagious matter of these diseasesdoes not affect the constitution by a fermentation, or chemical change ofthe blood, because then they must have proceeded together, and haveproduced a third something, not exactly similar to either of them: but thatthey produce new motions of the cutaneous terminations of theblood-vessels, which for a time proceed daily with increasing activity,like some paroxysms of fever, till they at length secrete or form a similarpoison by these unnatural actions."|FALSE
15707|"Now as in the measles one kind of unnatural motion takes place, and in thesmall-pox another kind, it is easy to conceive, that these different kindsof morbid motions cannot exist together; and therefore, that that which hasfirst begun will continue till the system becomes habituated to thestimulus which occasions it, and has ceased to be thrown into action by it;and then the other kind of stimulus will in its turn produce fever, and newkinds of motions peculiar to itself."|FALSE

XXII. 3. 3. that it is probable, that the variolous matter isdiffused through the blood; I prevailed on my friend Mr. Power, surgeon atBosworth in Leicestershire to try, whether the small-pox could beinoculated by using the blood of a variolous patient instead of the matterfrom the pustules; as I thought such an experiment might throw some lightat least on this interesting subject. The following is an extract from hisletter:--"|FALSE

On the same day I inoculated fourother children liable to receive the infection with blood taken fromanother person on the fourth day after the commencement of the eruption.The patients from whom the blood was taken had the disease mildly, but hadthe most pustules of any I could select from twenty inoculated patients;and as much of the blood was insinuated under the cuticle as I couldintroduce by elevating the skin without drawing blood; and three or foursuch punctures were made in each of their arms, and the blood was used inits fluid state."|FALSE

A slightsubcuticular discoloration, with rather a livid appearance, withoutsoreness or pain, was visible in them all, as well as in my own hand. 15.The discoloration somewhat less, without pain or soreness. Some patientsinoculated on the same day with variolous matter have considerableinflammation. 17. The discoloration is quite gone in them all, and from myown hand, a dry mark only remaining. And they were all inoculated on the18th, with variolous matter, which produced the disease in them all.\""|FALSE

15707|"Shall we conclude from hence, that the variolous matter never enters theblood-vessels? but that the morbid motions of the vessels of the skinaround the insertion of it continue to increase in a larger and largercircle for six or seven days; that then their quantity of morbid actionbecomes great enough to produce a fever-fit, and to affect the stomach byassociation of motions? and finally, that a second association of motionsis produced between the stomach and the other parts of the skin, inducingthem into morbid actions similar to those of the circle round the insertionof the variolous matter? Many more experiments and observations arerequired before this important question can be satisfactorily answered."|FALSE
15707|"It may be adduced, that as the matter inserted into the skin of the armfrequently swells the lymphatic in the axilla, that in that circumstance itseems to be there arrested in its progress, and cannot be imagined to enterthe blood by that lymphatic gland till the swelling of it subsides. Someother phænomena of the disease are more easily reconcileable to this theoryof sympathetic motions than to that of absorption; as the time taken upbetween the insertion of the matter, and the operation of it on the system,as mentioned above. For the circle around the insertion is seen toincrease, and to inflame; and I believe, undergoes a kind of diurnalparoxysm of torpor and paleness with a succeeding increase of action andcolour, like a topical fever-fit. Whereas if the matter is conceived tocirculate for six or seven days with the blood, without producing disorder,it ought to be rendered milder, or the blood-vessels more familiarized toits acrimony."|FALSE
15707|"It is much easier to conceive from this doctrine of associated orsympathetic motions of distant parts of the system, how it happens, thatthe variolous infection can be received but once, as before explained; thanby supposing, that a change is effected in the mass of blood by any kind offermentative process."|FALSE
15707|"The curious circumstance of the two contagions of small-pox and measles notacting at the same time, but one of them resting or suspending its actiontill that of the other ceases, may be much easier explained fromsympathetic or associated actions of the infected part with other parts ofthe system, than it can from supposing the two contagions to enter thecirculation."|FALSE
15707|"The skin of the face is subject to more frequent vicissitudes of heat andcold, from its exposure to the open air, and is in consequence more liableto sensitive association with the stomach than any other part of thesurface of the body, because their actions have been more frequently thusassociated. Thus in a surfeit from drinking cold water, when a person isvery hot and fatigued, an eruption is liable to appear on the face inconsequence of this sympathy. In the same manner the rosy eruption on thefaces of drunkards more probably arises from the sympathy of the face withthe stomach, rather than between the face and the liver, as is generallysupposed."|FALSE
15707|"This sympathy between the stomach and the skin of the face is apparent inthe eruption of the small-pox; since, where the disease is in considerablequantity, the eruption on the face first succeeds the sickness of thestomach. In the natural disease the stomach seems to be frequentlyprimarily affected, either alone or along with the tonsils, as the matterseems to be only diffused in the air, and by being mixed with the saliva,or mucus of the tonsils, to be swallowed into the stomach."|FALSE
15707|"After some days the irritative circles of motions become disordered by thisnew stimulus, which acts upon the mucus lining of the stomach; andsickness, vertigo, and a diurnal fever succeed. These disordered irritativemotions become daily increased for two or three days, and then by theirincreased action certain sensitive motions, or inflammation, is produced,and at the next cold fit of fever, when the stomach recovers from itstorpor, an inflammation of the external skin is formed in points (whichafterwards suppurate), by sensitive association, in the same manner as acough is produced in consequence of exposing the feet to cold, as describedin Sect. XXV. 17. and Class IV. 2. I. 7.

Where the new vessels, and enlarged old ones, which constituteinflammation, are not so hastily distended as to burst, and form a new kindof gland for the secretion of matter, as above mentioned; if suchcircumstances happen as diminish the painful sensation, the tendency togrowth ceases, and by and by an absorption commences, not only of thesuperabundant quantity of fluids deposited in the inflamed part, but of thesolids likewise, and this even of the hardest kind."|FALSE
15707|"Thus during the growth of the second set of teeth in children, the roots ofthe first set are totally absorbed, till at length nothing of them remainsbut the crown; though a few weeks before, if they are drawn immaturely,their roots are found complete. Similar to this Mr. Hunter has observed,that where a dead piece of bone is to exfoliate, or to separate from aliving one, that the dead part does not putrify, but remains perfectlysound, while the surface of the living part of the bone, which is incontact with the dead part, becomes absorbed, and thus effects itsseparation. Med. Comment. Edinb. V. 1. 425. In the same manner thecalcareous matter of gouty concretions, the coagulable lymph deposited oninflamed membranes in rheumatism and extravasated blood become absorbed;which are all as solid and as indissoluble materials as the new vesselsproduced in inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"This absorption of the new vessels and deposited fluids of inflamed partsis called resolution: it is produced by first using such internal means asdecrease the pain of the part, and in consequence its new motions, asrepeated bleeding, cathartics, diluent potations, and warm bath."|FALSE
15707|"After the vessels are thus emptied, and the absorption of the new vesselsand deposited fluids is evidently begun, it is much promoted by stimulatingthe part externally by solutions of lead, or other metals, and internallyby the bark, and small doses of opium. Hence when an ophthalmy begins tobecome paler, any acrid eye-water, as a solution of six grains of whitevitriol in an ounce of water, hastens the absorption, and clears the eye ina very short time. But the same application used a few days sooner wouldhave increased the inflammation. Hence after evacuation opium in smalldoses may contribute to promote the absorption of fluids deposited on thebrain, as observed by Mr. Bromfield in his treatise of surgery."|FALSE
15707|"2. Where an abscess is formed by the rupture of these new vessels, theviolence of inflammation ceases, and a new gland separates a materialcalled pus: at the same time a less degree of inflammation produces newvessels called vulgarly proud flesh; which, if no bandage confines itsgrowth, nor any other circumstance promotes absorption in the wound, wouldrise to a great height above the usual size of the part."|FALSE
15707|"Hence the art of healing ulcers consists in producing a tendency toabsorption in the wound greater than the deposition. Thus when anill-conditioned ulcer separates a copious and thin discharge, by the use ofany stimulus, as of salts of lead, or mercury, or copper externallyapplied, the discharge becomes diminished in quantity, and becomes thicker,as the thinner parts are first absorbed."|FALSE

Where the inflammation proceeds with greater violence or rapidity, thatis, when by the painful sensation a more inordinate activity of the organis produced, and by this great activity an additional quantity of painfulsensation follows in an increasing ratio, till the whole of the sensorialpower, or spirit of animation, in the part becomes exhausted, amortification ensues, as in a carbuncle, in inflammations of the bowels, inthe extremities of old people, or in the limbs of those who are broughtnear a fire after having been much benumbed with cold. And from hence itappears, why weak people are more subject to mortification than strongones, and why in weak persons less pain will produce mortification, namely,because the sensorial power is sooner exhausted by any excess of activity.I remember seeing a gentleman who had the preceding day travelled twostages in a chaise with what he termed a bearable pain in his bowels; whichwhen I saw him had ceased rather suddenly, and without a passage throughhim; his pulse was then weak, though not very quick; but as nothing whichhe swallowed would continue in his stomach many minutes, I concluded thatthe bowel was mortified; he died on the next day.

When the motions of any part of the system, in consequence of previoustorpor, are performed with more energy than in the irritative fevers, adisagreeable sensation is produced, and new actions of some part of thesystem commence in consequence of this sensation conjointly with theirritation: which motions constitute inflammation. If the fever be attendedwith a strong pulse, as in pleurisy, or rheumatism, it is termed synochasensitiva, or sensitive fever with strong pulse; which is usually termedinflammatory fever.

These morbidactions, which are thus produced by two sensorial powers, viz. byirritation and sensation, secrete new living fibres, which elongate the oldvessels, or form new ones, and at the same time much heat is evolved fromthese combinations. By the rupture of these vessels, or by a newconstruction of their apertures, purulent matters are secreted of variouskinds; which are infectious the first time they are applied to the skinbeneath the cuticle, or swallowed with the saliva into the stomach. Thiscontagion acts not by its being absorbed into the circulation, but by thesympathies, or associated actions, between the part first stimulated by thecontagious matter and the other parts of the system. Thus in the naturalsmall-pox the contagion is swallowed with the saliva, and by its stimulusinflames the stomach; this variolous inflammation of the stomach increasesevery day, like the circle round the puncture of an inoculated arm, till itbecomes great enough to disorder the circles of irritative and sensitivemotions, and thus produces fever-fits, with sickness and vomiting. Lastly,after the cold paroxysm, or fit of torpor, of the stomach has increased fortwo or three successive days, an inflammation of the skin commences inpoints; which generally first appear upon the face, as the associatedactions between the skin of the face and that of the stomach have been morefrequently exerted together than those of any other parts of the externalsurface."|FALSE

15707|"I. 1. Before we commence this Section on Diseased Voluntary Motions, it maybe necessary to premise, that the word volition is not used in this workexactly in its common acceptation. Volition is said in Section V. to bearthe same analogy to desire and aversion, which sensation does to pleasureand pain. And hence that, when desire or aversion produces any action ofthe muscular fibres, or of the organs of sense, they are termed volition;and the actions produced in consequence are termed voluntary actions.Whence it appears, that motions of our muscles or ideas may be produced inconsequence of desire or aversion without our having the power to preventthem, and yet these motions may be termed voluntary, according to ourdefinition of the word; though in common language they would be calledinvoluntary."|FALSE
15707|"The objects of desire and aversion are generally at a distance, whereasthose of pleasure and pain are immediately acting upon our organs. Hence,before desire or aversion are exerted, so as to cause any actions, there isgenerally time for deliberation; which consists in discovering the means toobtain the object of desire, or to avoid the object of aversion; or inexamining the good or bad consequences, which may result from them. In thiscase it is evident, that we have a power to delay the proposed action, orto perform it; and this power of choosing, whether we shall act or not, isin common language expressed by the word volition, or will. Whereas in thiswork the word volition means simply the active state of the sensorialfaculty in producing motion in consequence of desire or aversion: whetherwe have the power of restraining that action, or not; that is, whether weexert any actions in consequence of opposite desires or aversions, or not."|FALSE
15707|"For if the objects of desire or aversion are present, there is no necessityto investigate or compare the _means_ of obtaining them, nor do we alwaysdeliberate about their consequences; that is, no deliberation necessarilyintervenes, and in consequence the power of choosing to act or not is notexerted. It is probable, that this twofold use of the word volition in alllanguages has confounded the metaphysicians, who have disputed about freewill and necessity. Whereas from the above analysis it would appear, thatduring our sleep, we use no voluntary exertions at all; and in our wakinghours, that they are the consequence of desire or aversion."|FALSE
15707|"To will is to act in consequence of desire; but to desire means to desiresomething, even if that something be only to become free from the pain,which causes the desire; for to desire nothing is not to desire; the worddesire, therefore, includes both the action and the object or motive; forthe object and motive of desire are the same thing. Hence to desire withoutan object, that is, without a motive, is a solecism in language. As if oneshould ask, if you could eat without food, or breathe without air."|FALSE
15707|"From this account of volition it appears, that convulsions of the muscles,as in epileptic fits, may in the common sense of that word be termedinvoluntary; because no deliberation is interposed between the desire oraversion and the consequent action; but in the sense of the word, as abovedefined, they belong to the class of voluntary motions, as delivered inVol. II. Class III. If this use of the word be discordant to the ear of thereader, the term morbid voluntary motions, or motions in consequence ofaversion, may be substituted in its stead."|FALSE
15707|"If a person has a desire to be cured of the ague, and has at the same timean aversion (or contrary desire) to swallowing an ounce of Peruvian bark;he balances desire against desire, or aversion against aversion; and thushe acquires the power of choosing, which is the common acceptation of theword _willing_. But in the cold fit of ague, after having discovered thatthe act of shuddering, or exerting the subcutaneous muscles, relieves thepain of cold; he immediately exerts this act of volition, and shudders, assoon as the pain and consequent aversion return, without any deliberationintervening; yet is this act, as well as that of swallowing an ounce of thebark, caused by volition; and that even though he endeavours in vain toprevent it by a weaker contrary volition. This recalls to our minds thestory of the hungry ass between two hay-stacks, where the two desires aresupposed so exactly to counteract each other, that he goes to neither ofthe stacks, but perishes by want. Now as two equal and opposite desires arethus supposed to balance each other, and prevent all action, it follows,that if one of these hay-stacks was suddenly removed, that the ass wouldirresistibly be hurried to the other, which in the common use of the wordmight be called an involuntary act; but which, in our acceptation of it,would be classed amongst voluntary actions, as above explained."|FALSE
15707|"Hence to deliberate is to compare opposing desires or aversions, and thatwhich is the most interesting at length prevails, and produces action.Similar to this, where two pains oppose each other, the stronger or moreinteresting one produces action; as in pleurisy the pain from suffocationwould produce expansion of the lungs, but the pain occasioned by extendingthe inflamed membrane, which lines the chest, opposes this expansion, andone or the other alternately prevails."|FALSE

15707|"If any one is told not to swallow his saliva for a minute, he soon swallowsit contrary to his will, in the common sense of that word; but this also isa voluntary action, as it is performed by the faculty of volition, and isthus to be understood. When the power of volition is exerted on any of oursenses, they become more acute, as in our attempts to hear small noises inthe night. As explained in Section XIX. 6. Hence by our attention to thefauces from our desire not to swallow our saliva; the fauces become moresensible; and the stimulus of the saliva is followed by greater sensation,and consequent desire of swallowing it. So that the desire or volition inconsequence of the increased sensation of the saliva is more powerful, thanthe previous desire not to swallow it. See Vol. II. Deglutitio invita. Inthe same manner if a modest man wishes not to want to make water, when heis confined with ladies in a coach or an assembly-room; that very act ofvolition induces the circumstance, which he wishes to avoid, as aboveexplained; insomuch that I once saw a partial insanity, which might becalled a voluntary diabetes, which was occasioned by the fear (andconsequent aversion) of not being able to make water at all."|FALSE
15707|"It is further necessary to observe here, to prevent any confusion ofvoluntary, with sensitive, or associate motions, that in all the instancesof violent efforts to relieve pain, those efforts are at first voluntaryexertions; but after they have been frequently repeated for the purpose ofrelieving certain pains, they become associated with those pains, and ceaseat those times to be subservient to the will; as in coughing, sneezing, andstrangury. Of these motions those which contribute to remove or dislodgethe offending cause, as the actions of the abdominal muscles in parturitionor in vomiting, though they were originally excited by volition, are inthis work termed sensitive motions; but those actions of the muscles ororgans of sense, which do not contribute to remove the offending cause, asin general convulsions or in madness, are in this work termed voluntarymotions, or motions in consequence of aversion, though in common languagethey are called involuntary ones. Those sensitive unrestrainable actions,which contribute to remove the cause of pain are uniformly and invariablyexerted, as in coughing or sneezing; but those motions which are exerted inconsequence of aversion without contributing to remove the painful cause,but only to prevent the sensation of it, as in epileptic, or catalepticfits, are not uniformly and invariably exerted, but change from one set ofmuscles to another, as will be further explained; and may by this criterionalso be distinguished from the former."|FALSE
15707|"At the same time those motions, which are excited by perpetual stimulus, orby association with each other, or immediately by pleasureable or painfulsensation, may properly be termed involuntary motions, as those of theheart and arteries; as the faculty of volition seldom affects those, exceptwhen it exists in unnatural quantity, as in maniacal people."|FALSE
15707|"2. It was observed in Section XIV. on the Production of Ideas, that thoseparts of the system, which are usually termed the organs of sense, areliable to be excited into pain by the excess of the stimulus of thoseobjects, which are by nature adapted to affect them; as of too great light,sound, or pressure. But that these organs receive no pain from the defector absence of these stimuli, as in darkness or silence. But that our otherorgans of perception, which have generally been called appetites, as ofhunger, thirst, want of heat, want of fresh air, are liable to be affectedwith pain by the defect, as well as by the excess of their appropriatedstimuli."|FALSE
15707|"This excess or defect of stimulus is however to be considered only as theremote cause of the pain, the immediate cause being the excess or defect ofthe natural action of the affected part, according to Sect. IV. 5. Henceall the pains of the body may be divided into those from excess of motion,and those from defect of motion; which distinction is of great importancein the knowledge and the cure of many diseases. For as the pains fromexcess of motion either gradually subside, or are in general succeeded byinflammation; so those from defect of motion either gradually subside, orare in general succeeded by convulsion, or madness. These pains are easilydistinguishable from each other by this circumstance, that the former areattended with heat of the pained part, or of the whole body; whereas thelatter exists without increase of heat in the pained part, and is generallyattended with coldness of the extremities of the body; which is the truecriterion of what have been called nervous pains."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when any acrid material, as snuff or lime, falls into the eye, painand inflammation and heat are produced from the excess of stimulus; butviolent hunger, hemicrania, or the clavus hystericus, are attended withcoldness of the extremities, and defect of circulation. When we are exposedto great cold, the pain we experience from the deficiency of heat isattended with a quiescence of the motions of the vascular system; so thatno inflammation is produced, but a great desire of heat, and a tremulousmotion of the subcutaneous muscles, which is properly a convulsion inconsequence of this pain from defect of the stimulus of heat."|FALSE
15707|"It was before mentioned, that as sensation consists in certain movements ofthe sensorium, beginning at some of the extremities of it, and propagatedto the central parts of it; so volition consists of certain other movementsof the sensorium, commencing in the central parts of it, and propagated tosome of its extremities. This idea of these two great powers of motion inthe animal machine is confirmed from observing, that they never exist in agreat degree or universally at the same time; for while we strongly exertour voluntary motions, we cease to feel the pains or uneasinesses, whichoccasioned us to exert them."|FALSE
15707|"Hence during the time of fighting with fists or swords no pain is felt bythe combatants, till they cease to exert themselves. Thus in the beginningof ague-fits the painful sensation of cold is diminished, while the patientexerts himself in the shivering and gnashing of his teeth. He then ceasesto exert himself, and the pain of cold returns; and he is thus perpetuallyinduced to reiterate these exertions, from which he experiences a temporaryrelief. The same occurs in labour-pains, the exertion of the parturientwoman relieves the violence of the pains for a time, which recur again soonafter she has ceased to use those exertions. The same is true in many otherpainful diseases, as in the strangury, tenesmus, and the efforts ofvomiting; all these disagreeable sensations are diminished or removed for atime by the various exertions they occasion, and recur alternately withthose exertions."|FALSE
15707|"The restlessness in some fevers is an almost perpetual exertion of thiskind, excited to relieve some disagreeable sensations; the reciprocalopposite exertions of a wounded worm, the alternate emprosthotonos andopisthotonos of some spasmodic diseases, and the intervals of allconvulsions, from whatever cause, seem to be owing to this circumstance ofthe laws of animation; that great or universal exertion cannot exist at thesame time with great or universal sensation, though they can existreciprocally; which is probably resolvable into the more general law, thatthe whole sensorial power being expended in one mode of exertion, there isnone to spare for any other. Whence syncope, or temporary apoplexy,succeeds to epileptic convulsions."|FALSE
15707|"3. Hence when any violent pain afflicts us, of which we can neither avoidnor remove the cause, we soon learn to endeavour to alleviate it, byexerting some violent voluntary effort, as mentioned above; and arenaturally induced to use those muscles for this purpose, which have been inthe early periods of our lives most frequently or most powerfully exerted."|FALSE
15707|"Now the first muscles, which infants use most frequently, are those ofrespiration; and on this account we gain a habit of holding our breath, atthe same time that we use great efforts to exclude it, for this purpose ofalleviating unavoidable pain; or we press out our breath through a smallaperture of the larynx, and scream violently, when the pain is greater thanis relievable by the former mode of exertion. Thus children scream torelieve any pain either of body or mind, as from anger, or fear of beingbeaten."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it is curious to observe, that those animals, who have morefrequently exerted their muscles of respiration violently, as in talking,barking, or grunting, as children, dogs, hogs, scream much more, when theyare in pain, than those other animals, who use little or no language intheir common modes of life; as horses, sheep, and cows."|FALSE
15707|"The next most frequent or most powerful efforts, which infants are firsttempted to produce, are those with the muscles in biting hard substances;indeed the exertion of these muscles is very powerful in commonmastication, as appears from the pain we receive, if a bit of bone isunexpectedly found amongst our softer food; and further appears from theiracting to so great mechanical disadvantage, particularly when we bite withthe incisores, or canine teeth; which are first formed, and thence arefirst used to violent exertion."|FALSE
15707|"Hence when a person is in great pain, the cause of which he cannot remove,he sets his teeth firmly together, or bites some substance between themwith great vehemence, as another mode of violent exertion to produce atemporary relief.

15707|"Hence in violent spasmodic pains I have seen people bite not only theirtongues, but their arms or fingers, or those of the attendants, or anyobject which was near them; and also strike, pinch, or tear, others orthemselves, particularly the part of their own body, which is painful atthe time. Soldiers, who die of painful wounds in battle, are said in Homerto bite the ground. Thus also in the bellon, or colica saturnina, thepatients are said to bite their own flesh, and dogs in this disease to biteup the ground they lie upon. It is probable that the great endeavours tobite in mad dogs, and the violence of other mad animals, is owing to thesame cause."|FALSE
15707|"4. If the efforts of our voluntary motions are exerted with still greaterenergy for the relief of some disagreeable sensation, convulsions areproduced; as the various kinds of epilepsy, and in some hysteric paroxysms.In all these diseases a pain, or disagreeable sensation is produced,frequently by worms, or acidity in the bowels, or by a diseased nerve inthe side, or head, or by the pain of a diseased liver."|FALSE
15707|"In some constitutions a more intolerable degree of pain is produced in somepart at a distance from the cause by sensitive association, as beforeexplained; these pains in such constitutions arise to so great a degree,that I verily believe no artificial tortures could equal some, which I havewitnessed; and am confident life would not have long been preserved, unlessthey had been soon diminished or removed by the universal convulsion of thevoluntary motions, or by temporary madness."|FALSE
15707|"In some of the unfortunate patients I have observed, the pain has risen toan inexpressible degree, as above described, before the convulsions havesupervened; and which were preceded by screaming, and grinning; in others,as in the common epilepsy, the convulsion has immediately succeeded thecommencement of the disagreeable sensations; and as a stupor frequentlysucceeds the convulsions, they only seemed to remember that a pain at thestomach preceded the fit, or some other uneasy feel; or more frequentlyretained no memory at all of the immediate cause of the paroxysm. But evenin this kind of epilepsy, where the patient does not recollect anypreceding pain, the paroxysms generally are preceded by a quivering motionof the under jaw, with a biting of the tongue; the teeth afterwards becomepressed together with vehemence, and the eyes are then convulsed, beforethe commencement of the universal convulsion; which are all efforts torelieve pain."|FALSE
15707|"The reason why these convulsive motions are alternately exerted andremitted was mentioned above, and in Sect. XII. 1. 3. when the exertionsare such as give a temporary relief to the pain, which excites them, theycease for a time, till the pain is again perceived; and then new exertionsare produced for its relief. We see daily examples of this in the loudreiterated laughter of some people; the pleasureable sensation, whichexcites this laughter, arises for a time so high as to change its name andbecome painful: the convulsive motions of the respiratory muscles relievethe pain for a time; we are, however, unwilling to lose the pleasure, andpresently put a stop to this exertion, and immediately the pleasure recurs,and again as instantly rises into pain. All of us have felt the pain ofimmoderate laughter; children have been tickled into convulsions of thewhole body; and others have died in the act of laughing; probably from aparalysis succeeding the long continued actions of the muscles ofrespiration."|FALSE
15707|"Hence we learn the reason, why children, who are so easily excited to laughby the tickling of other people's fingers, cannot tickle themselves intolaughter. The exertion of their hands in the endeavour to tickle themselvesprevents the necessity of any exertion of the respiratory muscles torelieve the excess of pleasurable affection. See Sect. XVII. 3. 5."|FALSE

15707|"There are instances of epilepsy being produced by laughing recorded by VanSwieten, T. III. 402 and 308. And it is well known, that many people havedied instantaneously from the painful excess of joy, which probably mighthave been prevented by the exertions of laughter."|FALSE
15707|"Every combination of ideas, which we attend to, occasions pain or pleasure;those which occasion pleasure, furnish either social or selfish pleasure,either malicious or friendly, or lascivious, or sublime pleasure; that is,they give us pleasure mixed with other emotions, or they give us unmixedpleasure, without occasioning any other emotions or exertions at the sametime. This unmixed pleasure, if it be great, becomes painful, like allother animal motions from stimuli of every kind; and if no other exertionsare occasioned at the same time, we use the exertion of laughter to relievethis pain. Hence laughter is occasioned by such wit as excites simplepleasure without any other emotion, such as pity, love, reverence. Forsublime ideas are mixed with admiration, beautiful ones with love, new oneswith surprise; and these exertions of our ideas prevent the action oflaughter from being necessary to relieve the painful pleasure abovedescribed. Whence laughable wit consists of frivolous ideas, withoutconnections of any consequence, such as puns on words, or on phrases,incongruous junctions of ideas; on which account laughter is so frequent inchildren."|FALSE

15707|"5. If the pains, or disagreeable sensations, above described do not obtaina temporary relief from these convulsive exertions of the muscles, thoseconvulsive exertions continue without remission, and one kind of catalepsyis produced. Thus when a nerve or tendon produces great pain by its beinginflamed or wounded, the patient sets his teeth firmly together, and grinsviolently, to diminish the pain; and if the pain is not relieved by thisexertion, no relaxation of the maxillary muscles takes place, as in theconvulsions above described, but the jaws remain firmly fixed together.This locked jaw is the most frequent instance of cataleptic spasm, becausewe are more inclined to exert the muscles subservient to mastication fromtheir early obedience to violent efforts of volition."|FALSE
15707|"But in the case related in Sect. XIX. on Reverie, the cataleptic lady hadpain in her upper teeth; and pressing one of her hands vehemently againsther cheek-bone to diminish this pain, it remained in that attitude forabout half an hour twice a day, till the painful paroxysm was over."|FALSE

15707|"In these spasms it should seem, that the muscle itself is first thrown intocontraction by some disagreeable sensation, as of cold; and that then theviolent pain is produced by the great contraction of the muscular fibresextending its own tendons, which are said to be sensible to extension only;and is further explained in Sect. XVIII. 15."|FALSE
15707|"6. Many instances have been given in this work, where after violent motionsexcited by irritation, the organ has become quiescent to less, and even tothe great irritation, which induced it into violent motion; as afterlooking long at the sun or any bright colour, they cease to be seen; andafter removing from bright day-light into a gloomy room, the eye cannot atfirst perceive the objects, which stimulate it less. Similar to this is thesyncope, which succeeds after the violent exertions of our voluntarymotions, as after epileptic fits, for the power of volition acts in thiscase as the stimulus in the other. This syncope is a temporary palsy, orapoplexy, which ceases after a time, the muscles recovering their power ofbeing excited into action by the efforts of volition; as the eye in thecircumstance above mentioned recovers in a little time its power of seeingobjects in a gloomy room; which were invisible immediately after coming outof a stronger light. This is owing to an accumulation of sensorial powerduring the inaction of those fibres, which were before accustomed toperpetual exertions, as explained in Sect. XII. 7. 1. A slighter degree ofthis disease is experienced by every one after great fatigue, when themuscles gain such inability to further action, that we are obliged to restthem for a while, or to summon a greater power of volition to continuetheir motions."|FALSE
15707|"In all the syncopes, which I have seen induced after convulsive fits, thepulse has continued natural, though the organs of sense, as well as thelocomotive muscles, have ceased to perform their functions; for it isnecessary for the perception of objects, that the external organs of senseshould be properly excited by the voluntary power, as the eye-lids must beopen, and perhaps the muscles of the eye put into action to distend, andthence give greater pellucidity to the cornea, which in syncope, as indeath, appears flat and less transparent."|FALSE

Hence in syncope as in sleep, as the powerof volition is suspended, no external objects are perceived. See Sect.XVIII. 5. During the time which the patient lies in a fainting fit, thespirit of animation becomes accumulated; and hence the muscles in a whilebecome irritable by their usual stimulation, and the fainting fit ceases.See Sect. XII. 7. 1."|FALSE
15707|"7. If the exertion of the voluntary motions has been still more energetic,the quiescence, which succeeds, is so complete, that they cannot again beexcited into action by the efforts of the will. In this manner the palsy,and apoplexy (which is an universal palsy) are frequently produced afterconvulsions, or other violent exertions; of this I shall add a fewinstances."|FALSE

And it is probable, that those, who have expired fromimmoderate laughter, have died from this paralysis consequent to violentexertion. Mrs. Scott of Stafford was walking in her garden in perfecthealth with her neighbour Mrs. ----; the latter accidentally fell into amuddy rivulet, and tried in vain to disengage herself by the assistance ofMrs. Scott's hand. Mrs. Scott exerted her utmost power for many minutes,first to assist her friend, and next to prevent herself from being pulledinto the morass, as her distressed companion would not disengage her hand.After other assistance was procured by their united screams, Mrs. Scottwalked to a chair about twenty yards from the brook, and was seized with anapoplectic stroke: which continued many days, and terminated in a totalloss of her right arm, and her speech; neither of which she ever afterperfectly recovered."|FALSE
15707|"It is said, that many people in Holland have died after skating too long ortoo violently on their frozen canals; it is probable the death of these,and of others, who have died suddenly in swimming, has been owing to thisgreat quiescence or paralysis; which has succeeded very violent exertions,added to the concomitant cold, which has had greater effect after thesufferers had been heated and exhausted by previous exercise."|FALSE

His cousin and fellow-student ofthe same name, knowing the other could not swim, plunged into the waterafter him, caught him by his clothes, and approaching the bank by avehement exertion propelled him safe to the land, but that instant, seized,as was supposed, by the cramp, or paralysis, sunk to rise no more. Thereason why the cramp of the muscles, which compose the calf of the leg, isso liable to affect swimmers, is, because these muscles have very weakantagonists, and are in walking generally elongated again after theircontraction by the weight of the body on the ball of the toe, which is verymuch greater than the resistance of the water in swimming. See SectionXVIII. 15."|FALSE
15707|"It does not follow that every apoplectic or paralytic attack is immediatelypreceded by vehement exertion; the quiescence, which succeeds exertion, andwhich is not so great as to be termed paralysis, frequently recursafterwards at certain periods; and by other causes of quiescence, occurringwith those periods, as was explained in treating of the paroxysms ofintermitting fevers; the quiescence at length, becomes so great as to beincapable of again being removed by the efforts of volition, and completeparalysis is formed. See Section XXXII. 3. 2."|FALSE

And the accountgiven before of dropsies, which very frequently are owing to a paralysis ofthe absorbent system, and are generally attendant on free drinkers ofspirituous liquors, confirmed me in this opinion."|FALSE

15707|"I cannot dismiss this subject without observing, that after a paralyticstroke, if the vital powers are not much injured, that the patient has allthe movements of the affected limb to learn over again, just as in earlyinfancy; the limb is first moved by the irritation of its muscles, as instretching, (of which a case was related in Section VII. 1. 3.) or by theelectric concussion; afterwards it becomes obedient to sensation, as inviolent danger or fear; and lastly, the muscles become again associatedwith volition, and gradually acquire their usual habits of acting together."|FALSE
15707|"Another phænomenon in palsies is, that when the limbs of one side aredisabled, those of the other are in perpetual motion. This can only beexplained from conceiving that the power of motion, whatever it is, orwherever it resides, and which is capable of being exhausted by fatigue,and accumulated in rest, is now less expended, whilst one half of the bodyis capable of receiving its usual proportion of it, and is hence derivedwith greater ease or in greater abundance into the limbs, which remainunaffected."|FALSE
15707|"II. 1. The excess or defect of voluntary exertion produces similar effectsupon the sensual motions, or ideas of the mind, as those already mentionedupon the muscular fibres. Thus when any violent pain, arising from thedefect of some peculiar stimulus, exists either in the muscular or sensualsystems of fibres, and which cannot be removed by acquiring the defectivestimulus; as in some constitutions convulsions of the muscles are producedto procure a temporary relief, so in other constitutions vehement voluntaryexertions of the ideas of the mind are produced for the same purpose; forduring this exertion, like that of the muscles, the pain either vanishes oris diminished: this violent exertion constitutes madness; and in many casesI have seen the madness take place, and the convulsions cease, andreciprocally the madness cease, and the convulsions supervene. See SectionIII. 5. 8."|FALSE
15707|"2. Madness is distinguishable from delirium, as in the latter the patientknows not the place where he resides, nor the persons of his friends orattendants, nor is conscious of any external objects, except when spoken towith a louder voice, or stimulated with unusual force, and even then hesoon relapses into a state of inattention to every thing about him. Whilstin the former he is perfectly sensible to every thing external, but has thevoluntary powers of his mind intensely exerted on some particular object ofhis desire or aversion, he harbours in his thoughts a suspicion of allmankind, lest they should counteract his designs; and while he keeps hisintentions, and the motives of his actions profoundly secret; he isperpetually studying the means of acquiring the object of his wish, or ofpreventing or revenging the injuries he suspects."|FALSE
15707|"3. A late French philosopher, Mr. Helvetius, has deduced almost all ouractions from this principle of their relieving us from the ennui or tædiumvitæ; and true it is, that our desires or aversions are the motives of allour voluntary actions; and human nature seems to excel other animals in themore facil use of this voluntary power, and on that account is more liableto insanity than other animals. But in mania this violent exertion ofvolition is expended on mistaken objects, and would not be relieved, thoughwe were to gain or escape the objects, that excite it. Thus I have seen twoinstances of madmen, who conceived that they had the itch, and several havebelieved they had the venereal infection, without in reality having asymptom of either of them. They have been perpetually thinking upon thissubject, and some of them were in vain salivated with design of convincingthem to the contrary."|FALSE
15707|"4. In the minds of mad people those volitions alone exist, which areunmixed with sensation; immoderate suspicion is generally the firstsymptom, and want of shame, and want of delicacy about cleanliness.Suspicion is a voluntary exertion of the mind arising from the pain offear, which it is exerted to relieve: shame is the name of a peculiardisagreeable sensation, see Fable of the Bees, and delicacy aboutcleanliness arises from another disagreeable sensation. And therefore arenot found in the minds of maniacs, which are employed solely in voluntaryexertions. Hence the most modest women in this disease walk naked amongstmen without any kind of concern, use obscene discourse, and have nodelicacy about their natural evacuations."|FALSE
15707|"5. Nor are maniacal people more attentive to their natural appetites, or tothe irritations which surround them, except as far as may respect theirsuspicions or designs; for the violent and perpetual exertions of theirvoluntary powers of mind prevents their perception of almost every otherobject, either of irritation or of sensation. Hence it is that they bearcold, hunger, and fatigue, with much greater pertinacity than in theirsober hours, and are less injured by them in respect to their generalhealth. Thus it is asserted by historians, that Charles the Twelfth ofSweden slept on the snow, wrapped only in his cloak, at the siege ofFrederickstad, and bore extremes of cold and hunger, and fatigue, underwhich numbers of his soldiers perished; because the king was insane withambition, but the soldier had no such powerful stimulus to preserve hissystem from debility and death."|FALSE
15707|"6. Besides the insanities arising from exertions in consequence of pain,there is also a pleasurable insanity, as well as a pleasurable delirium; asthe insanity of personal vanity, and that of religious fanaticism. Whenagreeable ideas excite into motion the sensorial power of sensation, andthis again causes other trains of agreeable ideas, a constant stream ofpleasurable ideas succeeds, and produces pleasurable delirium. So when thesensorial power of volition excites agreeable ideas, and the pleasure thusproduced excites more volition in its turn, a constant flow of agreeablevoluntary ideas succeeds; which when thus exerted in the extremeconstitutes insanity."|FALSE
15707|"Thus when our muscular actions are excited by our sensations of pleasure,it is termed play; when they are excited by our volition, it is termedwork; and the former of these is attended with less fatigue, because themuscular actions in play produce in their turn more pleasurable sensation;which again has the property of producing more muscular action. Anagreeable instance of this I saw this morning. A little boy, who was tiredwith walking, begged of his papa to carry him. \"Here,\" says the reverenddoctor, \"ride upon my gold-headed cane;\" and the pleased child, putting itbetween his legs, gallopped away with delight, and complained no more ofhis fatigue. Here the aid of another sensorial power, that of pleasurablesensation, superadded vigour to the exertion of exhausted volition. Whichcould otherwise only have been excited by additional pain, as by the lashof slavery. On this account where the whole sensorial power has beenexerted on the contemplation of the promised joys of heaven, the saints ofall persecuted religions have borne the tortures of martyrdom withotherwise unaccountable firmness."|FALSE
15707|"7. There are some diseases, which obtain at least a temporary relief fromthe exertions of insanity; many instances of dropsies being thus for a timecured are recorded. An elderly woman labouring with ascites I twice sawrelieved for some weeks by insanity, the dropsy ceased for several weeks,and recurred again alternating with the insanity. A man afflicted withdifficult respiration on lying down, with very irregular pulse, andoedematous legs, whom I saw this day, has for above a week been muchrelieved in respect to all those symptoms by the accession of insanity,which is shewn by inordinate suspicion, and great anger."|FALSE
15707|"In cases of common temporary anger the increased action of the arterialsystem is seen by the red skin, and increased pulse, with the immediateincrease of muscular activity. A friend of mine, when he was painfullyfatigued by riding on horseback, was accustomed to call up ideas into hismind, which used to excite his anger or indignation, and thus for a time atleast relieved the pain of fatigue. By this temporary insanity, the effectof the voluntary power upon the whole of his system was increased; as inthe cases of dropsy above mentioned, it would appear, that the increasedaction of the voluntary faculty of the sensorium affected the absorbentsystem, as well as the secerning one."|FALSE
15707|"8. In respect to relieving inflammatory pains, and removing fever, I haveseen many instances, as mentioned in Sect. XII. 2. 4. One lady, whom Iattended, had twice at some years interval a locked jaw, which relieved apain on her sternum with peripneumony. Two other ladies I saw, who towardsthe end of violent peripneumony, in which they frequently lost blood, wereat length cured by insanity supervening. In the former the increasedvoluntary exertion of the muscles of the jaw, in the latter that of theorgans of sense, removed the disease; that is, the disagreeable sensation,which had produced the inflammation, now excited the voluntary power, andthese new voluntary exertions employed or expended the superabundantsensorial power, which had previously been exerted on the arterial system,and caused inflammation."|FALSE
15707|"Another case, which I think worth relating, was of a young man abouttwenty; he had laboured under an irritative fever with debility for threeor four weeks, with very quick and very feeble pulse, and other usualsymptoms of that species of typhus, but at this time complained much andfrequently of pain of his legs and feet. When those who attended him werenearly in despair of his recovery, I observed with pleasure an insanity ofmind supervene: which was totally different from delirium, as he knew hisfriends, calling them by their names, and the room in which he lay, butbecame violently suspicious of his attendants, and calumniated withvehement oaths his tender mother, who sat weeping by his bed. On this hispulse became slower and firmer, but the quickness did not for some timeintirely cease, and he gradually recovered. In this case the introductionof an increased quantity of the power of volition gave vigour to thosemovements of the system, which are generally only actuated by the power ofirritation, and of association."|FALSE
15707|"Another case I recollect of a young man, about twenty-five, who had thescarlet-fever, with very quick pulse, and an universal eruption on hisskin, and was not without reason esteemed to be in great danger of hislife. After a few days an insanity supervened, which his friends mistookfor delirium, and he gradually recovered, and the cuticle peeled off. Fromthese and a few other cases I have always esteemed insanity to be afavourable sign in fevers, and have cautiously distinguished it fromdelirium."|FALSE
15707|"III. Another mode of mental exertion to relieve pain, is by producing atrain of ideas not only by the efforts of volition, as in insanity; but bythose of sensation likewise, as in delirium and sleep. This mental effortis termed reverie, or somnambulation, and is described more at large inSect. XIX. on that subject. But I shall here relate another case of thatwonderful disease, which fell yesterday under my eye, and to which I haveseen many analogous alienations of mind, though not exactly similar in allcircumstances. But as all of them either began or terminated with pain orconvulsion, there can be no doubt but that they are of epileptic origin,and constitute another mode of mental exertion to relieve some painfulsensation."|FALSE
15707|"1. Master A. about nine years old, had been seized at seven every morningfor ten days with uncommon fits, and had had slight returns in theafternoon. They were supposed to originate from worms, and had been in vainattempted to be removed by vermifuge purges. As his fit was expected atseven yesterday morning, I saw him before that hour; he was asleep, seemedfree from pain, and his pulse natural. About seven he began to complain ofpain about his navel, or more to the left side, and in a few minutes hadexertions of his arms and legs like swimming. He then for half an hourhunted a pack of hounds; as appeared by his hallooing, and calling the dogsby their names, and discoursing with the attendants of the chase,describing exactly a day of hunting, which (I was informed) he hadwitnessed a year before, going through all the most minute circumstances ofit; calling to people, who were then present, and lamenting the absence ofothers, who were then also absent. After this scene he imitated, as he layin bed, some of the plays of boys, as swimming and jumping. He then sung anEnglish and then an Italian song; part of which with his eyes open, andpart with them closed, but could not be awakened or excited by anyviolence, which it was proper to use."|FALSE
15707|"After about an hour he came suddenly to himself with apparent surprise, andseemed quite ignorant of any part of what had passed, and after beingapparently well for half an hour, he suddenly fell into a great stupor,with slower pulse than natural, and a slow moaning respiration, in which hecontinued about another half hour, and then recovered."|FALSE
15707|"The sequel of this disease was favourable; he was directed one grain ofopium at six every morning, and then to rise out of bed; at half past sixhe was directed fifteen drops of laudanum in a glass of wine and water. Thefirst day the paroxysm became shorter, and less violent. The dose of opiumwas increased to one-half more, and in three or four days the fits lefthim. The bark and filings of iron were also exhibited twice a day; and Ibelieve the complaint returned no more."|FALSE
15707|"2. In this paroxysm it must be observed, that he began with pain, and endedwith stupor, in both circumstances resembling a fit of epilepsy. And thattherefore the exertions both of mind and body, both the voluntary ones, andthose immediately excited by pleasurable sensation, were exertions torelieve pain."|FALSE
15707|"The hunting scene appeared to be rather an act of memory than ofimagination, and was therefore rather a voluntary exertion, though attendedwith the pleasurable eagerness, which was the consequence of those ideasrecalled by recollection, and not the cause of them."|FALSE
15707|"These ideas thus voluntarily recollected were succeeded by sensations ofpleasure, though his senses were unaffected by the stimuli of visible oraudible objects; or so weakly excited by them as not to produce sensationor attention. And the pleasure thus excited by volition produced otherideas and other motions in consequence of the sensorial power of sensation.Whence the mixed catenations of voluntary and sensitive ideas and muscularmotions in reverie; which, like every other kind of vehement exertion,contribute to relieve pain, by expending a large quantity of sensorialpower."|FALSE
15707|"Those fits generally commence during sleep, from whence I suppose they havebeen thought to have some connection with sleep, and have thence beentermed Somnambulism; but their commencement during sleep is owing to ourincreased excitability by internal sensations at that time, as explained inSect. XVIII. 14. and 15., and not to any similitude between reverie andsleep."|FALSE

15707|"When the beginning of such a train of actions becomes by any meansdisordered, the succeeding part is liable to become disturbed inconsequence, and this is commonly termed sympathy or consent of parts bythe writers of medicine. For the more clear understanding of thesesympathies we must consider a tribe or train of actions as divided into twoparts, and call one of them the primary or original motions, and the otherthe secondary or sympathetic ones."|FALSE
15707|"The primary and secondary parts of a train of irritative actions mayreciprocally affect each other in four different manners. 1. They may bothbe exerted with greater energy than natural. 2. The former may act withgreater, and the latter with less energy. 3. The former may act with less,and the latter with greater energy. 4. They may both act with less energythan natural. I shall now give an example of each kind of these modes ofaction, and endeavour to shew, that though the primary and secondary partsof these trains or tribes of motion are connected by irritativeassociation, or their previous habits of acting together, as described inSect. XX. on Vertigo. Yet that their acting with similar or dissimilardegrees of energy, depends on the greater or less quantity of sensorialpower, which the primary part of the train expends in its exertions."|FALSE
15707|"The actions of the stomach constitute so important a part of theassociations of both irritative and sensitive motions, that it is said tosympathize with almost every part of the body; the first example, which Ishall adduce to shew that both the primary and secondary parts of a trainof irritative associations of motion act with increased energy, is takenfrom the consent of the skin with this organ. When the action of the fibresof the stomach is increased, as by the stimulus of a full meal, theexertions of the cutaneous arteries of the face become increased by theirirritative associations with those of the stomach, and a glow or flushingof the face succeeds. For the small vessels of the skin of the face havingbeen more accustomed to the varieties of action, from their frequentexposure to various degrees of cold and heat become more easily excitedinto increased action, than those of the covered parts of our bodies, andthus act with more energy from their irritative or sensitive associationswith the stomach. On this account in small-pox the eruption in consequenceof the previous affection of the stomach breaks out a day sooner on theface than on the hands, and two days sooner than on the trunk, and recedesin similar times after maturation."|FALSE
15707|"But secondly, in weaker constitutions, that is, in those who possess lesssensorial power, so much of it is expended in the increased actions of thefibres of the stomach excited by the stimulus of a meal, that a sense ofchilness succeeds instead of the universal glow above mentioned; and thusthe secondary part of the associated train of motions is diminished inenergy, in consequence of the increased activity of the primary part of it."|FALSE
15707|"2. Another instance of a similar kind, where the secondary part of thetrain acts with less energy in consequence of the greater exertions of theprimary part, is the vertigo attending intoxication; in this circumstanceso much sensorial power is expended on the stomach, and on its nearest ormore strongly associated motions, as those of the subcutaneous vessels, andprobably of the membranes of some internal viscera, that the irritativemotions of the retina become imperfectly exerted from deficiency ofsensorial power, as explained in Sect. XX. and XXI. 3. on Vertigo and onDrunkenness, and hence the staggering inebriate cannot completely balancehimself by such indistinct vision."|FALSE
15707|"3. An instance of the third circumstance, where the primary part of a trainof irritative motions acts with less, and the secondary part with greaterenergy, may be observed by making the following experiment. If a personlies with his arms and shoulders out of bed, till they become cold, atemporary coryza or catarrh is produced; so that the passage of thenostrils becomes totally obstructed; at least this happens to many people;and then on covering the arms and shoulders, till they become warm, thepassage of the nostrils ceases again to be obstructed, and a quantity ofmucus is discharged from them. In this case the quiescence of the vesselsof the skin of the arms and shoulders, occasioned by exposure to cold air,produces by irritative association an increased action of the vessels ofthe membrane of the nostrils; and the accumulation of sensorial powerduring the torpor of the arms and shoulders is thus expended in producing atemporary coryza or catarrh."|FALSE
15707|"Another instance may be adduced from the sympathy or consent of the motionsof the stomach with other more distant links of the very extensive tribesor trains of irritative motions associated with them, described in Sect.XX. on Vertigo. When the actions of the fibres of the stomach arediminished or inverted, the actions of the absorbent vessels, which take upthe mucus from the lungs, pericardium, and other cells of the body, becomeincreased, and absorb the fluids accumulated in them with greater avidity,as appears from the exhibition of foxglove, antimony, or other emetics incases of anasarca, attended with unequal pulse and difficult respiration."|FALSE
15707|"That the act of nausea and vomiting is a decreased exertion of the fibresof the stomach may be thus deduced; when an emetic medicine isadministered, it produces the pain of sickness, as a disagreeable taste inthe mouth produces the pain of nausea; these pains, like that of hunger, orof cold, or like those, which are usually termed nervous, as the head-achor hemicrania, do not excite the organ into greater action; but in thiscase I imagine the pains of sickness or of nausea counteract or destroy thepleasurable sensation, which seems necessary to digestion, as shewn inSect. XXXIII. 1. 1. The peristaltic motions of the fibres of the stomachbecome enfeebled by the want of this stimulus of pleasurable sensation, andin consequence stop for a time, and then become inverted; for they cannotbecome inverted without being previously stopped. Now that this inversionof the trains of motion of the fibres of the stomach is owing to thedeficiency of pleasurable sensation is evinced from this circumstance, thata nauseous idea excited by words will produce vomiting as effectually us anauseous drug."|FALSE
15707|"Hence it appears, that the act of nausea or vomiting expends less sensorialpower than the usual peristaltic motions of the stomach in the digestion ofour aliment; and that hence there is a greater quantity of sensorial powerbecomes accumulated in the fibres of the stomach, and more of it inconsequence to spare for the action of those parts of the system, which arethus associated with the stomach, as of the whole absorbent series ofvessels, and which are at the same time excited by their usual stimuli."|FALSE
15707|"From this we can understand, how after the operation of an emetic thestomach becomes more irritable and sensible to the stimulus, and thepleasure of food; since as the sensorial power becomes accumulated duringthe nausea and vomiting, the digestive power is afterwards exerted moreforceably for a time. It should, however, be here remarked, that thoughvomiting is in general produced by the defect of this stimulus ofpleasurable sensation, as when a nauseous drug is administered; yet in longcontinued vomiting, as in sea-sickness, or from habitual dram-drinking, itarises from deficiency of sensorial power, which in the former case isexhausted by the increased exertion of the irritative ideas of vision, andin the latter by the frequent application of an unnatural stimulus."|FALSE

15707|"Mrs. ----, about 30 years of age, was seized with great pain about themiddle of the right parietal bone, which had continued a whole day before Isaw her, and was so violent as to threaten to occasion convulsions. Notbeing able to detect a decaying tooth, or a tender one, by examination withmy eye, or by striking them with a tea-spoon, and fearing bad consequencesfrom her tendency to convulsion, I advised her to extract the last tooth ofthe under-jaw on the affected side; which was done without any good effect.She was then directed to lose blood, and to take a brisk cathartic; andafter that had operated, about 60 drops of laudanum were given her, withlarge doses of bark; by which the pain was removed. In about a fortnightshe took a cathartic medicine by ill advice, and the pain returned withgreater violence in the same place; and, before I could arrive, as shelived 30 miles from me, she suffered a paralytic stroke; which affected herlimbs and her face on one side, and relieved the pain of her head."|FALSE

Onexamining her mouth I found the second molaris of the under-jaw on the sidebefore affected was now decayed, and concluded, that this tooth hadoccasioned the stroke of the palsy by the pain and consequent exertion ithad caused. On this account I earnestly entreated her to allow the soundmolaris of the same jaw opposite to the decayed one to be extracted; whichwas forthwith done, and the pain of her head immediately ceased, to theastonishment of her attendants."|FALSE
15707|"In the cases above related of the pain existing in a part distant from theseat of the disease, the pain is owing to defect of the usual motions ofthe painful part. This appears from the coldness, paleness, and emptinessof the affected vessels, or of the extremities of the body in general, andfrom there being no tendency to inflammation. The increased action of theprimary part of these associated motions, as of the hepatic termination ofthe bile-duct; from the stimulus of a gall-stone, or of the interiortermination of the urethra from the stimulus of a stone in the bladder, orlastly, of a decaying tooth in hemicrania, deprives the secondary part ofthese associated motions, namely, the exterior terminations of thebile-duct or urethra, or the pained membranes of the head in hemicrania, oftheir natural share of sensorial power: and hence the secondary parts ofthese sensitive trains of association become pained from the deficiency oftheir usual motions, which is accompanied with deficiency of secretions andof heat. See Sect. IV. 5. XII. 5. 3. XXXIV. 1."|FALSE
15707|"Why does the pain of the primary part of the association cease, when thatof the secondary part commences? This is a question of intricacy, butperhaps not inexplicable. The pain of the primary part of these associatedtrains of motion was owing to too great stimulus, as of the stone at theneck of the bladder, and was consequently caused by too great action of thepained part. This greater action than natural of the primary part of theseassociated motions, by employing or expending the sensorial power ofirritation belonging to the whole associated train of motions, occasionedtorpor, and consequent pain in the secondary part of the associated train;which was possessed of greater sensibility than the primary part of it. Nowthe great pain of the secondary part of the train, as soon as it commences,employs or expends the sensorial power of sensation belonging to the wholeassociated train of motions; and in consequence the motions of the primarypart, though increased by the stimulus of an extraneous body, cease to beaccompanied with pain or sensation."|FALSE
15707|"If this mode of reasoning be just it explains a curious fact, why when twoparts of the body are strongly stimulated, the pain is felt only in one ofthem, though it is possible by voluntary attention it may be alternatelyperceived in them both. In the same manner, when two new ideas arepresented to us from the stimulus of external bodies, we attend to but oneof them at a time. In other words, when one set of fibres, whether of themuscles or organs of sense, contract so strongly as to excite muchsensation; another set of fibres contracting more weakly do not excitesensation at all, because the sensorial power of sensation is pre-occupiedby the first set of fibres. So we cannot will more than one effect at once,though by associations previously formed we can move many fibres incombination."|FALSE
15707|"Thus in the instances above related, the termination of the bile duct inthe duodenum, and the exterior extremity of the urethra, are more sensiblethan their other terminations. When these parts are deprived of their usualmotions by deficiency of sensorial power, as above explained, they becomepainful according to law the fifth in Section IV. and the less painoriginally excited by the stimulus of concreted bile, or of a stone attheir other extremities ceases to be perceived. Afterwards, however, whenthe concretions of bile, or the stone on the urinary bladder, become morenumerous or larger, the pain from their increased stimulus becomes greaterthan the associated pain; and is then felt at the neck of the gall bladderor urinary bladder; and the pain of the glans penis, or at the pit of thestomach, ceases to be perceived."|FALSE
15707|"2. Examples of the second mode, where the increased action of the primarypart of a train of sensitive association ceases, when that of the secondarypart commences, are also not unfrequent; as this is the usual manner of thetranslation of inflammations from internal to external parts of the system,such as when an inflammation of the liver or stomach is translated to themembranes of the foot, and forms the gout; or to the skin of the face, andforms the rosy drop; or when an inflammation of the membranes of thekidneys is translated to the skin of the loins, and forms one kind ofherpes, called shingles; in these cases by whatever cause the originalinflammation may have been produced, as the secondary part of the train ofsensitive association is more sensible, it becomes exerted with greaterviolence than the first part of it; and by both its increased pain, and theincreased motion of its fibres, so far diminishes or exhausts the sensorialpower of sensation; that the primary part of the train being less sensibleceases both to feel pain, and to act with unnatural energy."|FALSE
15707|"3. Examples of the third mode, where the primary part of a train ofsensitive association of motions may experience increased sensation, andthe secondary part increased action, are likewise not unfrequent; as it isin this manner that most inflammations commence. Thus, after standing sometime in snow, the feet become affected with the pain of cold, and a commoncoryza, or inflammation of the membrane of the nostrils, succeeds. It isprobable that the internal inflammations, as pleurisies, or hepatitis,which are produced after the cold paroxysm of fever, originate in the samemanner from the sympathy of those parts with some others, which werepreviously pained from quiescence; as happens to various parts of thesystem during the cold fits of fevers. In these cases it would seem, thatthe sensorial power of sensation becomes accumulated during the pain ofcold, as the torpor of the vessels occasioned by the defect of heatcontributes to the increase or accumulation of the sensorial power ofirritation, and that both these become exerted on some internal part, whichwas not rendered torpid by the cold which affected the external parts, norby its association with them; or which sooner recovered its sensibility.This requires further consideration."|FALSE
15707|"4. An example of the fourth mode, or where the primary part of a sensitiveassociation of motions may have increased action, and the secondary partincreased sensation, may be taken from the pain of the shoulder, whichattends inflammation of the membranes of the liver, see Class IV. 2. 2. 9.;in this circumstance so much sensorial power seems to be expended in theviolent actions and sensations of the inflamed membranes of the liver, thatthe membranes associated with them become quiescent to their usual stimuli,and painful in consequence."|FALSE
15707|"There may be other modes in which the primary and secondary parts of thetrains of associated sensitive motions may reciprocally affect each other,as may be seen by looking over Class IV. in the catalogue of diseases; allwhich may probably be resolved into the plus and minus of sensorial power,but we have not yet had sufficient observations made upon them with a viewto this doctrine."|FALSE

Those, which originate or recur at solar orlunar periods, are also explained in Section XXXII. 6. These we shall hereenumerate; observing, however, that it is not more surprising, that theinfluence of the varying attractions of the sun and moon, should raise theocean into mountains, than that it should affect the nice sensibilities ofanimal bodies; though the manner of its operation on them is difficult tobe understood. It is probable however, that as this influence graduallylessens during the course of the day, or of the lunation, or of the year,some actions of our system become less and less; till at length a totalquiescence of some part is induced; which is the commencement of theparoxysms of fever, of menstruation, of pain with decreased action of theaffected organ, and of consequent convulsion."|FALSE

15707|"IV. The critical days, in which fevers are supposed to terminate, haveemployed the attention of medical philosophers from the days of Hippocratesto the present time. In whatever part of a lunation a fever commences,which owes either its whole cause to solar and lunar influence, or to thisin conjunction with other causes; it would seem, that the effect would bethe greatest at the full and new moon, as the tides rise highest at thosetimes, and would be the least at the quadratures; thus if a fever-fitshould commence at the new or full moon, occasioned by the solar and lunarattraction diminishing some chemical affinity of the particles of blood,and thence decreasing their stimulus on our sanguiferous system, asmentioned in Sect. XXXII. 6. this effect will daily decrease for the firstseven days, and will then increase till about the fourteenth day, and willagain decrease till about the twenty-first day, and increase again till theend of the lunation. If a fever-fit from the above cause should commence onthe seventh day after either lunation, the reverse of the abovecircumstances would happen. Now it is probable, that those fevers, whosecrisis or terminations are influenced by lunations, may begin at one orother of the above times, namely at the changes or quadratures; thoughsufficient observations have not been made to ascertain this circumstance.Hence I conclude, that the small-pox and measles have their critical days,not governed by the times required for certain chemical changes in theblood, which affect or alter the stimulus of the contagious matter, butfrom the daily increasing or decreasing effect of this lunar link ofcatenation, as explained in Section XVII. 3. 3. And as other feversterminate most frequently about the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first, orabout the end of four weeks, when no medical assistance has disturbed theirperiods, I conclude, that these crises, or terminations, are governed byperiods of the lunations; though we are still ignorant of their manner ofoperation."|FALSE

When the pain of hunger requires relief, certain parts of the materialworld, which surround us, when applied to our palates, excite into actionthe muscles of deglutition; and the material is swallowed into the stomach.Here the new aliment becomes mixed with certain animal fluids, andundergoes a chemical process, termed digestion; which however chemistry hasnot yet learnt to imitate out of the bodies of living animals orvegetables. This process seems very similar to the saccharine process inthe lobes of farinaceous seeds, as of barley, when it begins to germinate;except that, along with the sugar, oil and mucilage are also produced;which form the chyle of animals, which is very similar to their milk."|FALSE
15707|"The reason, I imagine, why this chyle-making, or saccharine process, hasnot yet been imitated by chemical operations, is owing to the materialsbeing in such a situation in respect to warmth, moisture, and motion; thatthey will immediately change into the vinous or acetous fermentation;except the new sugar be absorbed by the numerous lacteal or lymphaticvessels, as soon as it is produced; which is not easy to imitate in thelaboratory."|FALSE
15707|"These lacteal vessels have mouths, which are irritated into action by thestimulus of the fluid, which surrounds them; and by animal selection, orappetency, they absorb such part of the fluid as is agreeable to theirpalate; those parts, for instance, which are already converted into chyle,before they have time to undergo another change by a vinous or acetousfermentation. This animal absorption of fluid is almost visible to thenaked eye in the action of the puncta lacrymalia; which imbibe the tearsfrom the eye, and discharge them again into the nostrils."|FALSE

The arteries constitute another reservoir of a changeful fluid; fromwhich, after its recent oxygenation in the lungs, a further animalselection of various fluids is absorbed by the numerous glands; theseselect their respective fluids from the blood, which is perpetuallyundergoing a chemical change; but the selection by these glands, like thatof the lacteals, which open their mouths into the digesting aliment in thestomach, is from animal appetency, not from chemical affinity; secretioncannot therefore be imitated in the laboratory, as it consists in aselection of part of a fluid during the chemical change of that fluid."|FALSE
15707|"The mouths of the lacteals, and lymphatics, and the ultimate terminationsof the glands, are finer than can easily be conceived; yet it is probable,that the pores, or interstices of the parts, or coats, which constitutethese ultimate vessels, may still have greater tenuity; and that thesepores from the above analogy must posses a similar power of irritability,and absorb by their living energy the particles of fluid adapted to theirpurposes, whether to replace the parts abraded or dissolved, or to elongateand enlarge themselves. Not only every kind of gland is thus endued withits peculiar appetency, and selects the material agreeable to its tastefrom the blood, but every individual pore acquires by animal selection thematerial, which it wants; and thus nutrition seems to be performed in amanner so similar to secretion; that they only differ in the one retaining,and the other parting again with the particles, which they have selectedfrom the blood."|FALSE
15707|"This way of accounting for nutrition from stimulus, and the consequentanimal selection of particles, is much more analogous to other phenomena ofthe animal microcosm, than by having recourse to the microscopicanimalcula, or organic particles of Buffon, and Needham; which beingalready compounded must themselves require nutritive particles to continuetheir own existence. And must be liable to undergo a change by ourdigestive or secretory organs; otherwise mankind would soon resemble bytheir theory the animals, which they feed upon.

These extremities of the nerves are either of thoseof locomotion, which are termed muscular fibres; or of those of sensation,which constitute the immediate organs of sense, and which have also theirpeculiar motions. Now as the fibres, which constitute the bones andmembranes, possessed originally sensation and motion; and are liable againto possess them, when they become inflamed; it follows, that those were,when first formed, appendages to the nerves of sensation or locomotion, orwere formed from them. And that hence all these solid parts of the body, asthey have originally consisted of extremities of nerves, require anapposition of nutritive particles of a similar kind, contrary to theopinion of Buffon and Needham above recited."|FALSE
15707|"Lastly, as all these filaments have possessed, or do possess, the power ofcontraction, and of consequent inertion or elongation; it seems probable,that the nutritive particles are applied during their times of elongation;when their original constituent particles are removed to a greater distancefrom each other. For each muscular or sensual fibre may be considered as arow or string of beads; which approach, when in contraction, and recededuring its rest or elongation; and our daily experience shews us, thatgreat action emaciates the system, and that it is repaired during rest."|FALSE

Now if a hair couldbe supposed to be thus immersed in a solution of particles similar tothose, which compose it; one may imagine, that it might be thus increasedin weight and magnitude; as the particles of oak-bark increase thesubstance of the hides of beasts in the process of making leather. Imention these not as philosophic analogies, but as similes to facilitateour ideas, how an accretion of parts may be effected by animal appetences,or selections, in a manner somewhat similar to mechanical or chemicalattractions."|FALSE
15707|"If those new particles of matter, previously prepared by digestion andsanguification, only supply the places of those, which have been abraded bythe actions of the system, it is properly termed nutrition.

15707|"In this last case something more than a simple apposition or selection ofparticles seems to be necessary; as many parts of the system during itsgrowth are caused to recede from those, with which they were before incontact; as the ends of the bones, or cartilages, recede from each other,as their growth advances: this process resembles inflammation, as appearsin ophthalmy, or in the production of new flesh in ulcers, where oldvessels are enlarged, and new ones produced; and like that is attended withsensation. In this situation the vessels become distended with blood, andacquire greater sensibility, and may thus be compared to the erection ofthe penis, or of the nipples of the breasts of women; while new particlesbecome added at the same time; as in the process of nutrition abovedescribed."|FALSE
15707|"When only the natural growth of the various parts of the body are produced,a pleasurable sensation attends it, as in youth, and perhaps in those, whoare in the progress of becoming fat.

15707|"IV. This apposition of new parts, as the old ones disappear, selected fromthe aliment we take, first enlarges and strengthens our bodies for twentyyears, for another twenty years it keeps us in health and vigour, and addsstrength and solidity to the system; and then gradually ceases to nourishus properly, and for another twenty years we gradually sink into decay, andfinally cease to act, and to exist."|FALSE
15707|"On considering this subject one should have imagined at first view, that itmight have been easier for nature to have supported her progeny for ever inhealth and life, than to have perpetually reproduced them by the wonderfuland mysterious process of generation. But it seems our bodies by long habitcease to obey the stimulus of the aliment, which should support us. Afterwe have acquired our height and solidity we make no more new parts, and thesystem obeys the irritations, sensations, volitions; and associations,with, less and less energy, till the whole sinks into inaction."|FALSE
15707|"Three causes may conspire to render our nerves less excitable, which havebeen already mentioned, 1. If a stimulus be greater than natural, itproduces too great an exertion of the stimulated organ, and in consequenceexhausts the spirit of animation; and the moving organ ceases to act, eventhough the stimulus be continued. And though rest will recruit thisexhaustion, yet some degree of permanent injury remains, as is evidentafter exposing the eyes long to too strong a light. 2. If excitationsweaker than natural be applied, so as not to excite the organ into action,(as when small doses of aloe or rhubarb are exhibited,) they may begradually increased, without exciting the organ into action; which willthus acquire a habit of disobedience to the stimulus; thus by increasingthe dose by degrees, great quantities of opium or wine may be taken withoutintoxication. See Sect. XII. 3. 1."|FALSE
15707|"3. Another mode, by which life is gradually undermined, is when irritativemotions continue to be produced in consequence of stimulus, but are notsucceeded by sensation; hence the stimulus of contagious matter is notcapable of producing fever a second time, because it is not succeeded bysensation. See Sect. XII. 3. 6. And hence, owing to the want of the generalpleasurable sensation, which ought to attend digestion and glandularsecretion, an irksomeness of life ensues; and, where this is in greaterexcess, the melancholy of old age occurs, with torpor or debility."|FALSE
15707|"From hence I conclude, that it is probable that the fibrillæ, or movingfilaments at the extremities of the nerves of sense, and the fibres whichconstitute the muscles (which are perhaps the only parts of the system thatare endued with contractile life) are not changed, as we advance in years,like the other parts of the body; but only enlarged or elongated with ourgrowth; and in consequence they become less and less excitable into action.Whence, instead of gradually changing the old animal, the generation of atotally new one becomes necessary with undiminished excitability; whichmany years will continue to acquire new parts, or new solidity, and thenlosing its excitability in time, perish like its parent."|FALSE

15707|"I. From the recent discoveries of many ingenious philosophers it appears,that during respiration the blood imbibes the vital part of the air, calledoxygene, through the membranes of the lungs; and that hence respiration maybe aptly compared to a slow combustion. As in combustion the oxygene of theatmosphere unites with some phlogistic or inflammable body, and forms anacid (as in the production of vitriolic acid from sulphur, or carbonic acidfrom charcoal,) giving out at the same time a quantity of the matter ofheat; so in respiration the oxygene of the air unites with the phlogisticpart of the blood, and probably produces phosphoric or animal acid,changing the colour of the blood from a dark to a bright red; and probablysome of the matter of heat is at the same time given out according to thetheory of Dr. Crawford. But as the evolution of heat attends almost allchemical combinations, it is probable, that it also attends the secretionsof the various fluids from the blood; and that the constant combinations orproductions of new fluids by means of the glands constitute the moregeneral source of animal heat; this seems evinced by the universalevolution of the matter of heat in the blush of shame or of anger; in whichat the same time an increased secretion of the perspirable matter occurs;and the partial evolution of it from topical inflammations, as in gout orrheumatism, in which there is a secretion of new blood-vessels."|FALSE

15707|"Besides the supposed production of phosphoric acid, and change of colour ofthe blood, and the production of carbonic acid, there would appear to besomething of a more subtile nature perpetually acquired from theatmosphere; which is too fine to be long contained in animal vessels, andtherefore requires perpetual renovation; and without which life cannotcontinue longer than a minute or two; this ethereal fluid is probablysecreted from the blood by the brain, and perpetually dissipated in theactions of the muscles and organs of sense."|FALSE

15707|"II. Sir Edward Hulse, a physician of reputation at the beginning of thepresent century, was of opinion, that the placenta was a respiratory organ,like the gills of fish; and not an organ to supply nutriment to the foetus;as mentioned in Derham's Physico-theology. Many other physicians seem tohave espoused the same opinion, as noticed by Haller. Elem. Physiologiæ, T.1. Dr. Gipson published a defence of this theory in the Medical Essays ofEdinburgh, Vol. I. and II. which doctrine is there controverted at large bythe late Alexander Monro; and since that time the general opinion has been,that the placenta is an organ of nutrition only, owing perhaps rather tothe authority of so great a name, than to the validity of the argumentsadduced in its support. The subject has lately been resumed by Dr. JamesJeffray, and by Dr. Forester French, in their inaugural dissertations atEdinburgh and at Cambridge; who have defended the contrary opinion in anable and ingenious manner; and from whose Theses I have extracted many ofthe following remarks."|FALSE
15707|"First, by the late discoveries of Dr. Priestley, M. Lavoisier, and otherphilosophers, it appears, that the basis of atmospherical air, calledoxygene, is received by the blood through the membranes of the lungs; andthat by this addition the colour of the blood is changed from a dark to alight red. Secondly, that water possesses oxygene also as a part of itscomposition, and contains air likewise in its pores; whence the blood offish receives oxygene from the water, or from the air it contains, by meansof their gills, in the same manner as the blood is oxygenated in the lungsof air-breathing animals; it changes its colour at the same time from adark to a light red in the vessels of their gills, which constitute apulmonary organ adapted to the medium in which they live. Thirdly, that theplacenta consists of arteries carrying the blood to its extremities, and avein bringing it back, resembling exactly in structure the lungs and gillsabove mentioned; and that the blood changes its colour from a dark to alight red in passing through these vessels."|FALSE
15707|"This analogy between the lungs and gills of animals, and the placenta ofthe fetus, extends through a great variety of other circumstances; thusair-breathing creatures and fish can live but a few minutes without air orwater; or when they are confined in such air or water, as has been spoiledby their own respiration; the same happens to the fetus, which, as soon asthe placenta is separated from the uterus, must either expand its lungs,and receive air, or die. Hence from the structure, as well as the use ofthe placenta, it appears to be a respiratory organ, like the gills of fish,by which the blood in the fetus becomes oxygenated."|FALSE
15707|"From the terminations of the placental vessels not being observed to bleedafter being torn from the uterus, while those of the uterus effuse a greatquantity of florid arterial blood, the terminations of the placentalvessels would seem to be inserted into the arterial ones of the mother; andto receive oxygenation from the passing currents of her blood through theircoats or membranes; which oxygenation is proved by the change of the colourof the blood from dark to light red in its passage from the placentalarteries to the placental vein."|FALSE
15707|"The curious structure of the cavities or lacunæ of the placenta,demonstrated by Mr. J. Hunter, explain this circumstance. That ingeniousphilosopher has shewn, that there are numerous cavities of lacunæ formed onthat side of the placenta, which is in contact with the uterus; thosecavities or cells are filled with blood from the maternal arteries, whichopen into them; which blood is again taken up by the maternal veins, and isthus perpetually changed. While the terminations of the placental arteriesand veins are spread in fine reticulation on the sides of these cells. Andthus, as the growing fetus requires greater oxygenation, an apparatus isproduced resembling exactly the air-cells of the lungs."|FALSE
15707|"In cows, and other ruminating animals, the internal surface of the uterusis unequal like hollow cups, which have been called cotyledons; and intothese cavities the prominencies of the numerous placentas, with which thefetus of those animals is furnished, are inserted, and strictly adhere;though they may be extracted without effusion of blood. These inequalitiesof the uterus, and the numerous placentas in consequence, seem to bedesigned for the purpose of expanding a greater surface for theterminations of the placental vessels for the purpose of receivingoxygenation from the uterine ones; as the progeny of this class of animalsare more completely formed before their nativity, than that of thecarnivorous classes, and must thence in the latter weeks of pregnancyrequire greater oxygenation. Thus calves and lambs can walk about in a fewminutes after their birth; while puppies and kittens remain many dayswithout opening their eyes. And though on the separation of the cotyledonsof ruminating animals no blood is effused, yet this is owing clearly to thegreater power of contraction of their uterine lacunæ or alveoli. SeeMedical Essays, Vol. V. page 144. And from the same cause they are notliable to a sanguiferous menstruation."|FALSE
15707|"The necessity of the oxygenation of the blood in the fetus is fartherillustrated by the analogy of the chick in the egg; which appears to haveits blood oxygenated at the extremities of the vessels surrounding theyolk; which are spread on the air-bag at the broad end of the egg, and mayabsorb oxygene through that moist membrane from the air confined behind it;and which is shewn by experiments in the exhausted receiver to bechangeable though the shell."|FALSE
15707|"This analogy may even be extended to the growing seeds of vegetables; whichwere shewn by Mr. Scheele to require a renovation of the air over thewater, in which they were confined. Many vegetable seeds are surroundedwith air in their pods or receptacles, as peas, the fruit of staphylea, andlichnis vesicaria; but it is probable, that those seeds, after they areshed, as well as the spawn of fish, by the situation of the former on ornear the moist and aerated surface of the earth, and of the latter in theever-changing and ventilated water, may not be in need of an apparatus forthe oxygenation of their first blood, before the leaves of one, and thegills of the other, are produced for this purpose."|FALSE

15707|"First, that the liquor amnii is not an excrementitious fluid is evinced,because it is found in greater quantity, when the fetus is young,decreasing after a certain period till birth.

In theeggs of hens it is consumed on the eighteenth day, so that at the exclusionof the chick scarcely any remains. In rabbits before birth there is none.\"Elem. Physiol. Had this been an excrementitious fluid, the contrary wouldprobably have occurred. Secondly, the skin of the fetus is covered with awhitish crust or pellicle, which would seem to preclude any idea of theliquor amnii being produced by any exsudation of perspirable matter. And itcannot consist of urine, because in brute animals the urachus passes fromthe bladder to the alantois for the express purpose of carrying off thatfluid; which however in the human fetus seems to be retained in thedistended bladder, as the feces are accumulated in the bowels of allanimals."|FALSE

The othermonstrous fetus is described by Vander Wiel, who asserts, that he saw amonstrous lamb, which had no mouth; but instead of it was furnished with anopening in the lower part of the neck into the stomach.

The yolk of the egg is a stillstronger or more nutritive fluid, which is drawn up into the bowels of thechick just at its exclusion from the shell, and serves it for nourishmentfor a day or two, till it is able to digest, and has learnt to choose theharder seeds or grains, which are to afford it sustenance. Nothinganalogous to this yolk is found in the fetus of lactiferous animals, as themilk is another nutritive fluid ready prepared for the young progeny."|FALSE

15707|"II. 1. The process of generation is still involved in impenetrableobscurity, conjectures may nevertheless be formed concerning some of itscircumstances. First, the eggs of fish and frogs are impregnated, afterthey leave the body of the female; because they are deposited in a fluid,and are not therefore covered with a hard shell. It is however remarkable,that neither frogs nor fish will part with their spawn without the presenceof the male; on which account female carp and gold-fish in small ponds,where there are no males, frequently die from the distention of theirgrowing spawn. 2. The eggs of fowls, which are laid without beingimpregnated, are seen to contain only the yolk and white, which areevidently the food or sustenance for the future chick. 3. As thecicatricula of these eggs is given by the cock, and is evidently therudiment of the new animal; we may conclude, that the embryon is producedby the male, and the proper food and nidus by the female. For if the femalebe supposed to form an equal part of the embryon, why should she form thewhole of the apparatus for nutriment and for oxygenation? the male in manyanimals is larger, stronger, and digests more food than the female, andtherefore should contribute as much or more towards the reproduction of thespecies; but if he contributes only half the embryon and none of theapparatus for sustenance and oxygenation, the division is unequal; thestrength of the male, and his consumption of food are too great for theeffect, compared with that of the female, which is contrary to the usualcourse of nature."|FALSE
15707|"In objection to this theory of generation it may be said, if the animalculain femine, as seen by the microscope, be all of them rudiments ofhomunculi, when but one of them can find a nidus, what a waste nature hasmade of her productions? I do not assert that these moving particles,visible by the microscope, are homunciones; perhaps they may be thecreatures of stagnation or putridity, or perhaps no creatures at all; butif they are supposed to be rudiments of homunculi, or embryons, such aprofusion of them corresponds with the general efforts of nature to providefor the continuance of her species of animals. Every individual treeproduces innumerable seeds, and every individual fish innumerable spawn, insuch inconceivable abundance as would in a short space of time crowd theearth and ocean with inhabitants; and these are much more perfect animalsthan the animalcula in femine can be supposed to be, and perish inuncounted millions. This argument only shews, that the productions ofnature are governed by general laws; and that by a wise superfluity ofprovision she has ensured their continuance."|FALSE
15707|"2. That the embryon is secreted or produced by the male, and not by theconjunction of fluids from both male and female, appears from the analogyof vegetable seeds. In the large flowers, as the tulip, there is nosimilarity of apparatus between the anthers and the stigma: the seed isproduced according to the observations of Spallanzani long before theflowers open, and in consequence long before it can be impregnated, likethe egg in the pullet. And after the prolific dust is shed on the stigma,the seed becomes coagulated in one point first, like the cicatricula of theimpregnated egg. See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note 38. Now inthese simple products of nature, if the female contributed to produce thenew embryon equally with the male, there would probably have been somevisible similarity of parts for this purpose, besides those necessary forthe nidus and sustenance of the new progeny. Besides in many flowers themales are more numerous than the females, or than the separate uterinecells in their germs, which would shew, that the office of the male was atleast as important as that of the female; whereas if the female, besidesproducing the egg or seed, was to produce an equal part of the embryon, theoffice of reproduction would be unequally divided between them."|FALSE
15707|"Add to this, that in the most simple kind of vegetable reproduction, I meanthe buds of trees, which are their viviparous offspring, the leaf isevidently the parent of the bud, which rises in its bosom, according to theobservation of Linnaeus. This leaf consists of absorbent vessels, andpulmonary ones, to obtain its nutriment, and to impregnate it with oxygene.This simple piece of living organization is also furnished with a power ofreproduction; and as the new offspring is thus supported adhering to itsfather, it needs no mother to supply it with a nidus, and nutriment, andoxygenation; and hence no female leaf has existence."|FALSE
15707|"I conceive that the vessels between the bud and the leaf communicate orinosculate; and that the bud is thus served with vegetable blood, that is,with both nutriment and oxygenation, till the death of the parent-leaf inautumn.

Secondly, that then the bark-vessels belonging to the dead-leaf,and in which I suppose a kind of manna to have been deposited, become nowthe placental vessels, if they may be so called, of the new bud. From thevernal sap thus produced of one sugar-maple-tree in New-York and inPennsylvania, five or six pounds of good sugar may be made annually withoutdestroying the tree. Account of maple-sugar by B. Rushes. London, Phillips.(See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note on vegetable placentation.)"|FALSE
15707|"These vessels, when the warmth of the vernal sun hatches the young bud,serve it with a saccharine nutriment, till it acquires leaves of its own,and shoots a new system of absorbents down the bark and root of the tree,just as the farinaceous or oily matter in seeds, and the saccharine matterin fruits, serve their embryons with nutriment, till they acquire leavesand roots. This analogy is as forceable in so obscure a subject, as it iscurious, and may in large buds, as of the horse-chesnut, be almost seen bythe naked eye; if with a penknife the remaining rudiment of the last year'sleaf, and of the new bud in its bosom, be cut away slice by slice. Theseven ribs of the last year's leaf will be seen to have arisen from thepith in seven distinct points making a curve; and the new bud to have beenproduced in their centre, and to have pierced the alburnum and cortex, andgrown without the assistance of a mother. A similar process may be seen ondissecting a tulip-root in winter; the leaves, which inclosed the lastyear's flower-stalk, were not necessary for the flower; but each of thesewas the father of a new bud, which may be now found at its base; and which,as it adheres to the parent, required no mother."|FALSE
15707|"This paternal offspring of vegetables, I mean their buds and bulbs, isattended with a very curious circumstance; and that is, that they exactlyresemble their parents, as is observable in grafting fruit-trees, and inpropagating flower-roots; whereas the seminal offspring of plants, beingsupplied with nutriment by the mother, is liable to perpetual variation.Thus also in the vegetable class dioicia, where the male flowers areproduced on one tree, and the female ones on another; the buds of the maletrees uniformly produce either male flowers, or other buds similar tothemselves; and the buds of the female trees produce either female flowers,or other buds similar to themselves; whereas the seeds of these treesproduce either male or female plants. From this analogy of the productionof vegetable buds without a mother, I contend that the mother does notcontribute to the formation of the living ens in animal generation, but isnecessary only for supplying its nutriment and oxygenation."|FALSE

Koelreuter, which he calls\"a complete metamorphosis of one natural species of plants into another,\"which shews, that in seeds as well as in buds, the embryon proceeds fromthe male parent, though the form of the subsequent mature plant is in partdependant on the female. M. Koelreuter impregnated a stigma of thenicotiana rustica with the farina of the nicotiana paniculata, and obtainedprolific seeds from it. With the plants which sprung from these seeds, herepeated the experiment, impregnating them with the farina of the nicotianapaniculata. As the mule plants which he thus produced were prolific, hecontinued to impregnate them for many generations with the farina of thenicotiana paniculata, and they became more and more like the male parent,till he at length obtained six plants in every respect perfectly similar tothe nicotiana paniculata; and in no respect resembling their female parentthe nicotiana rustica. _Blumenbach_ on Generation."|FALSE

Academ.)produce their progeny in the manner above described, that is, without amother, and not without a father; and thus experience a lucina sineconcubitu. Those who have attended to the habits of the polypus, which isfound in the stagnant water of our ditches in July, affirm, that the youngones branch out from the side of the parent like the buds of trees, andafter a time separate themselves from them. This is so analogous to themanner in which the buds of trees appear to be produced, that these polypimay be considered as all male animals, producing embryons, which require nomother to supply them with a nidus, or with nutriment, and oxygenation."|FALSE
15707|"This lateral or lineal generation of plants, not only obtains in the budsof trees, which continue to adhere to them, but is beautifully seen in thewires of knot-grass, polygonum aviculare, and in those of strawberries,fragaria vesca. In these an elongated creeping bud is protruded, and, whereit touches the ground, takes root, and produces a new plant derived fromits father, from which it acquires both nutriment and oxygenation; and inconsequence needs no maternal apparatus for these purposes. In viviparousflowers, as those of allium magicum, and polygonum viviparum, the anthersand the stigmas become effete and perish; and the lateral or paternaloffspring succeeds instead of seeds, which adhere till they aresufficiently mature, and then fall upon the ground, and take root likeother bulbs."|FALSE

Linnæus asserts, \"that it growsold at one extremity, while it continues to generate young ones at theother, proceeding ad infinitum, like a root of grass. The separate jointsare called gourd-worms, and propagate new joints like the parent withoutend, each joint being furnished with its proper mouth, and organs ofdigestion.\" Systema naturæ.

In this animal there evidentlyappears a power of reproduction without any maternal apparatus for thepurpose of supplying nutriment and oxygenation to the embryon, as itremains attached to its father till its maturity. The volvox globator,which is a transparent animal, is said by Linnæus to bear within it sonsand grand-sons to the fifth generation. These are probably living fetuses,produced by the father, of different degrees of maturity, to be detruded atdifferent periods of time, like the unimpregnated eggs of various sizes,which are found in poultry; and as they are produced without any knowncopulation, contribute to evince, that the living embryon in other ordersof animals is formed by the male-parent, and not by the mother, as oneparent has the power to produce it."|FALSE

15707|"III. 1. Many ingenious philosophers have found so great difficulty inconceiving the manner of the reproduction of animals, that they havesupposed all the numerous progeny, to have existed in miniature in theanimal originally created; and that these infinitely minute forms are onlyevolved or distended, as the embryon increases in the womb. This idea,besides its being unsupported by any analogy we are acquainted with,ascribes a greater tenuity to organized matter, than we can readily admit;as these included embryons are supposed each of them to consist of thevarious and complicate parts of animal bodies: they must possess a muchgreater degree of minuteness, than that which was ascribed to the devilsthat tempted St. Anthony; of whom 20,000 were said to have been able todance a saraband on the point of the finest needle without incommoding eachother."|FALSE

Others have supposed, that all the parts of the embryon are formed inthe male, previous to its being deposited in the egg or uterus; and that itis then only to have its parts evolved or distended as mentioned above; butthis is only to get rid of one difficulty by proposing another equallyincomprehensible: they found it difficult to conceive, how the embryoncould be formed in the uterus or egg, and therefore wished it to be formedbefore it came thither. In answer to both these doctrines it may beobserved, 1st, that some animals, as the crab-fish, can reproduce a wholelimb, as a leg which has been broken off; others, as worms and snails, canreproduce a head, or a tail, when either of them has been cut away; andthat hence in these animals at least a part can be formed anew, whichcannot be supposed to have existed previously in miniature."|FALSE
15707|"Secondly, there are new parts or new vessels produced in many diseases, ason the cornea of the eye in ophthalmy, in wens and cancers, which cannot besupposed to have had a prototype or original miniature in the embryon."|FALSE
15707|"Thirdly, how could mule-animals be produced, which partake of the forms ofboth the parents, if the original embryon was a miniature existing in thesemen of the male parent? if an embryon of the male ass was only expanded,no resemblance to the mare could exist in the mule."|FALSE
15707|"This mistaken idea of the extension of parts seems to have had its risefrom the mature man resembling the general form of the fetus; and fromthence it was believed, that the parts of the fetus were distended into theman; whereas they have increased 100 times in weight, as well as 100 timesin size; now no one will call the additional 99 parts a distention of theoriginal one part in respect to weight. Thus the uterus during pregnancy isgreatly enlarged in thickness and solidity as well as in capacity, andhence must have acquired this additional size by accretion of new parts,not by an extension of the old ones; the familiar act of blowing up thebladder of an animal recently slaughtered has led our imaginations to applythis idea of distention to the increase of size from natural growth; whichhowever must be owing to the apposition of new parts; as it is evinced fromthe increase of weight along with the increase of dimension; and is evenvisible to our eyes in the elongation of our hair from the colour of itsends; or when it has been dyed on the head; and in the growth of our nailsfrom the specks sometimes observable on them; and in the increase of thewhite crescent at their roots, and in the growth of new flesh in wounds,which consists of new nerves as well as of new blood-vessels."|FALSE

These organic particles hesupposes to exist in the spermatic fluids of both sexes, and that they arederived thither from every part of the body, and must therefore resemble,as he supposes, the parts from whence they are derived. These organicparticles he believes to be in constant activity, till they become mixed inthe womb, and then they instantly join and produce an embryon or fetussimilar to the two parents."|FALSE

I conceive the primordium, or rudiment of the embryon, as secretedfrom the blood of the parent, to consist of a simple living filament as amuscular fibre; which I suppose to be an extremity of a nerve ofloco-motion, as a fibre of the retina is an extremity of a nerve ofsensation; as for instance one of the fibrils, which compose the mouth ofan absorbent vessel; I suppose this living filament, of whatever form itmay be, whether sphere, cube, or cylinder, to be endued with the capabilityof being excited into action by certain kinds of stimulus. By the stimulusof the surrounding fluid, in which it is received from the male, it maybend into a ring; and thus form the beginning of a tube. Such movingfilaments, and such rings, are described by those, who have attended tomicroscopic animalcula. This living ring may now embrace or absorb anutritive particle of the fluid, in which it swims; and by drawing it intoits pores, or joining it by compression to its extremities, may increaseits own length or crassitude; and by degrees the living ring may become aliving tube."|FALSE
15707|"2. With this new organization, or accretion of parts, new kinds ofirritability may commence; for so long as there was but one living organ,it could only be supposed to possess irritability; since sensibility may beconceived to be an extension of the effect of irritability over the rest ofthe system. These new kinds of irritability and of sensibility inconsequence of new organization, appear from variety of facts in the moremature animal; thus the formation of the testes, and consequent secretionof the semen, occasion the passion of lust; the lungs must be previouslyformed before their exertions to obtain fresh air can exist; the throat oroesophagus must be formed previous to the sensation or appetites of hungerand thirst; one of which seems to reside at the upper end, and the other atthe lower end of that canal."|FALSE

The same occurs to the nipples of thebreasts of female animals, when they are distended with blood, they acquirethe new appetency of giving milk. So inflamed tendons and membranes, andeven bones, acquire new sensations; and the parts of mutilated animals, asof wounded snails, and polypi, and crabs, are reproduced; and at the sametime acquire sensations adapted to their situations. Thus when the head ofa snail is reproduced after decollation with a sharp rasor, those curioustelescopic eyes are also reproduced, and acquire their sensibility tolight, as well as their adapted muscles for retraction on the approach ofinjury."|FALSE

These changes I conceive to be formed not by elongation ordistention of primeval stamina, but by apposition of parts; as the maturecrab-fish, when deprived of a limb, in a certain space of time has power toregenerate it; and the tadpole puts forth its feet long after its exclusionfrom the spawn; and the caterpillar in changing into a butterfly acquires anew form, with new powers, new sensations, and new desires."|FALSE

The moths, which fly by night, have a muchlonger proboscis rolled up under their chins like a watch spring; whichthey extend to collect the honey from flowers in their sleeping state; whenthey are closed, and the nectaries in consequence more difficult to beplundered.

For in general it wouldseem, that food of a more stimulating kind, the honey of vegetables insteadof their leaves, was necessary for the purpose of the seminal reproductionof these animals, exactly similar to what happens in vegetables; in thesethe juices of the earth are sufficient for their purpose of reproduction bybuds or bulbs; in which the new plant seems to be formed by irritativemotions, like the growth of their other parts, as their leaves or roots;but for the purpose of seminal or amatorial reproduction, where sensationis required, a more stimulating food becomes necessary for the anther, andstigma; and this food is honey; as explained in Sect. XIII. on VegetableAnimation."|FALSE

After these an apparatus of limbs for future uses, or forthe purpose of moving the body in its present natant state, and of lungsfor future respiration, and of testes for future reproduction, are formedby the irritations and sensations, and consequent exertions of the partspreviously existing, and to which the new parts are to be attached."|FALSE

In confirmation of these ideas it may be observed, that all the parts ofthe body endeavour to grow, or to make additional parts to themselvesthroughout our lives; but are restrained by the parts immediatelycontaining them; thus, if the skin be taken away, the fleshy parts beneathsoon shoot out new granulations, called by the vulgar proud flesh. If theperiosteum be removed, a similar growth commences from the bone.

Nor could the production of mulesexist, if the stamen or miniature of all the parts of the embryon ispreviously formed in the male semen, and is only distended by nourishmentin the female uterus.

This also may especially happen during the first state of theexistence of the embryon, before it has acquired organs, which can changethese first nutritive particles, as explained in No. 5. 2. of this Section.And as these nutritive particles are supposed to be similar to those, whichare formed for her own nutrition, it follows that the fetus should so farresemble the mother."|FALSE

Others are atthe same time owing to an increase of sensation, as in scrophula andconsumption; in these the obstruction of the fluids is first caused by theinirritability of the vessels, and the inflammation and ulcers whichsucceed, are caused by the consequent increase of sensation in theobstructed part. Other hereditary diseases, as the epilepsy, and otherconvulsions, consist in too great voluntary exertions in consequence ofdisagreeable sensation in some particular diseased part. Now as the pains,which occasion these convulsions, are owing to defect of the action of thediseased part, as shewn in Sect. XXXIV. it is plain, that all thesehereditary diseases may have their origin either from defectiveirritability derived from the father, or from deficiency of the stimulus ofthe nutriment derived from the mother. In either case the effect would besimilar; as a scrophulous race is frequently produced among the poor fromthe deficient stimulus of bad diet, or of hunger; and among the rich, by adeficient irritability from their having been long accustomed to too greatstimulus, as of vinous spirit."|FALSE
15707|"6. From this account of reproduction it appears, that all animals have asimilar origin, viz. from a single living filament; and that the differenceof their forms and qualities has arisen only from the differentirritabilities and sensibilities, or voluntarities, or associabilities, ofthis original living filament; and perhaps in some degree from thedifferent forms of the particles of the fluids, by which it has been atfirst stimulated into activity. And that from hence, as Linnæus hasconjectured in respect to the vegetable world, it is not impossible, butthe great variety of species of animals, which now tenant the earth, mayhave had their origin from the mixture of a few natural orders. And thatthose animal and vegetable mules, which could continue their species, havedone so, and constitute the numerous families of animals and vegetableswhich now exist; and that those mules, which were produced with imperfectorgans of generation, perished without reproduction, according to theobservation of Aristotle; and are the animals, which we now call mules.

15707|"Such a promiscuous intercourse of animals is said to exist at this day inNew South Wales by Captain Hunter. And that not only amongst the quadrupedsand birds of different kinds, but even amongst the fish, and, as hebelieves, amongst the vegetables. He speaks of an animal between theopossum and the kangaroo, from the size of a sheep to that of a rat. Manyfish seemed to partake of the shark; some with a shark's head andshoulders, and the hind part of a shark; others with a shark's head and thebody of a mullet; and some with a shark's head and the flat body of asting-ray. Many birds partake of the parrot; some have the head, neck, andbill of a parrot, with long straight feet and legs; others with legs andfeet of a parrot, with head and neck of a sea gull.

15707|"7. All animals therefore, I contend, have a similar cause of theirorganization, originating from a single living filament, endued indeed withdifferent kinds of irritabilities and sensibilities, or of animalappetencies; which exist in every gland, and in every moving organ of thebody, and are as essential to living organization as chemical affinitiesare to certain combinations of inanimate matter."|FALSE
15707|"If I might be indulged to make a simile in a philosophical work, I shouldsay, that the animal appetencies are not only perhaps less numerousoriginally than the chemical affinities; but that like these latter, theychange with every new combination; thus vital air and azote, when combined,produce nitrous acid; which now acquires the property of dissolving silver;so with every new additional part to the embryon, as of the throat orlungs, I suppose a new animal appetency to be produced."|FALSE
15707|"In this early formation of the embryon from the irritabilities,sensibilities, and associabilities, and consequent appetencies, the facultyof volition can scarcely be supposed to have had its birth. For about whatcan the fetus deliberate, when it has no choice of objects? But in the moreadvanced state of the fetus, it evidently possesses volition; as itfrequently changes its attitude, though it seems to sleep the greatest partof its time; and afterwards the power of volition contributes to change oralter many parts of the body during its growth to manhood, by our earlymodes of exertion in the various departments of life. All these facultiesthen constitute the vis fabricatrix, and the vis conservatrix, as well asthe vis medicatrix of nature, so much spoken of, but so little understoodby philosophers."|FALSE

When we revolve in our minds, first, the great changes, which we seenaturally produced in animals after their nativity, as in the production ofthe butterfly with painted wings from the crawling caterpillar; or of therespiring frog from the subnatant tadpole; from the feminine boy to thebearded man, and from the infant girl to the lactescent woman; both whichchanges may be prevented by certain mutilations of the glands necessary toreproduction."|FALSE

Those who labour at theanvil, the oar, or the loom, as well as those who carry sedan-chairs, orwho have been educated to dance upon the rope, are distinguishable by theshape of their limbs; and the diseases occasioned by intoxication deformthe countenance with leprous eruptions, or the body with tumid viscera, orthe joints with knots and distortions."|FALSE
15707|"Thirdly, when we enumerate the great changes produced in the species ofanimals before their nativity; these are such as resemble the form orcolour of their parents, which have been altered by the cultivation oraccidents above related, and are thus continued to their posterity. Or theyare changes produced by the mixture of species as in mules; or changesproduced probably by the exuberance of nourishment supplied to the fetus,as in monstrous births with additional limbs; many of these enormities ofshape are propagated, and continued as a variety at least, if not as a newspecies of animal. I have seen a breed of cats with an additional claw onevery foot; of poultry also with an additional claw, and with wings totheir feet; and of others without rumps. Mr. Buffon mentions a breed ofdogs without tails, which are common at Rome and at Naples, which hesupposes to have been produced by a custom long established of cuttingtheir tails close off.

In some this filament in itsadvance to maturity has acquired hands and fingers, with a fine sense oftouch, as in mankind. In others it has acquired claws or talons, as intygers and eagles. In others, toes with an intervening web, or membrane, asin seals and geese. In others it has acquired cloven hoofs, as in cows andswine; and whole hoofs in others, as in the horse. While in the bird kindthis original living filament has put forth wings instead of arms or legs,and feathers instead of hair. In some it has protruded horns on theforehead instead of teeth in the fore part of the upper jaw; in otherstushes instead of horns; and in others beaks instead of either.

See Sect. XXXI. 1."|FALSE
15707|"As air and water are supplied to animals in sufficient profusion, the threegreat objects of desire, which have changed the forms of many animals bytheir exertions to gratify them, are those of lust, hunger, and security. Agreat want of one part of the animal world has consisted in the desire ofthe exclusive possession of the females; and these have acquired weapons tocombat each other for this purpose, as the very thick, shield-like, hornyskin on the shoulder of the boar is a defence only against animals of hisown species, who strike obliquely upwards, nor are his tushes for otherpurposes, except to defend himself, as he is not naturally a carnivorousanimal. So the horns of the stag are sharp to offend his adversary, but arebranched for the purpose of parrying or receiving the thrusts of hornssimilar to his own, and have therefore been formed for the purpose ofcombating other stags for the exclusive possession of the females; who areobserved, like the ladies in the times of chivalry, to attend the car ofthe victor."|FALSE

The finalcause of this contest amongst the males seems to be, that the strongest andmost active animal should propagate the species, which should thence becomeimproved."|FALSE
15707|"Another great want consists in the means of procuring food, which hasdiversified the forms of all species of animals. Thus the nose of the swinehas become hard for the purpose of turning up the soil in search of insectsand of roots. The trunk of the elephant is an elongation of the nose forthe purpose of pulling down the branches of trees for his food, and fortaking up water without bending his knees. Beasts of prey have acquiredstrong jaws or talons. Cattle have acquired a rough tongue and a roughpalate to pull off the blades of grass, as cows and sheep. Some birds haveacquired harder beaks to crack nuts, as the parrot. Others have acquiredbeaks adapted to break the harder seeds, as sparrows. Others for the softerseeds of flowers, or the buds of trees, as the finches. Other birds haveacquired long beaks to penetrate the moister soils in search of insects orroots, as woodcocks; and others broad ones to filtrate the water of lakes,and to retain aquatic insects.

And yet the changes which many of them undergo intheir early state to that of their maturity, are as different, as oneanimal can be from another. As those of the gnat, which passes his earlystate in water, and then stretching out his new wings, and expanding hisnew lungs, rises in the air; as of the caterpillar, and bee-nymph, whichfeed on vegetable leaves or farina, and at length bursting from theirself-formed graves, become beautiful winged inhabitants of the skies,journeying from flower to flower, and nourished by the ambrosial food ofhoney."|FALSE

XIII. and to these mustbe added the buds and bulbs which constitute the viviparous offspring ofvegetation. The former I suppose to be beholden to a single living filamentfor their seminal or amatorial procreation; and the latter to the samecause for their lateral or branching generation, which they possess incommon with the polypus, tænia, and volvox; and the simplicity of which isan argument in favour of the similarity of its cause."|FALSE

From these one might be led toimagine, that each plant at first consisted of a single bulb or flower toeach root, as the gentianella and daisy; and that in the contest for airand light new buds grew on the old decaying flower stem, shooting downtheir elongated roots to the ground, and that in process of ages tall treeswere thus formed, and an individual bulb became a swarm of vegetables.Other plants, which in this contest for light and air were too slender torise by their own strength, learned by degrees to adhere to theirneighbours, either by putting forth roots like the ivy, or by tendrils likethe vine, or by spiral contortions like the honeysuckle; or by growing uponthem like the misleto, and taking nourishment from their barks; or by onlylodging or adhering on them, and deriving nourishment from the air, astillandsia."|FALSE

Plato havingprobably observed the reciprocal generation of inferior animals, as snailsand worms, was of opinion, that mankind with all other animals wereoriginally hermaphrodites during the infancy of the world, and were inprocess of time separated into male and female. The breasts and teats ofall male quadrupeds, to which no use can be now assigned, adds perhaps someshadow of probability to this opinion. Linnæus excepts the horse from themale quadrupeds, who have teats; which might have shewn the earlier originof his exigence; but Mr. J. Hunter asserts, that he has discovered thevestiges of them on his sheath, and has at the same time enriched naturalhistory with a very curious fact concerning the male pigeon; at the time ofhatching the eggs both the male and female pigeon undergo a great change intheir crops; which thicken and become corrugated, and secrete a kind ofmilky fluid, which coagulates, and with which alone they for a few daysfeed their young, and afterwards feed them with this coagulated fluid mixedwith other food.

15707|"V. 1. The efficient cause of the various colours of the eggs of birds, andof the air and feathers of animals, is a subject so curious, that I shallbeg to introduce it in this place. The colours of many animals seem adaptedto their purposes of concealing themselves either to avoid danger, or tospring upon their prey. Thus the snake and wild cat, and leopard, are socoloured as to resemble dark leaves and their lighter interstices; birdsresemble the colour of the brown ground, or the green hedges, which theyfrequent; and moths and butterflies are coloured like the flowers whichthey rob of their honey. Many instances are mentioned of this kind inBotanic Garden, p. 2. Note on Rubia."|FALSE
15707|"These colours have, however, in some instances another use, as the blackdiverging area from the eyes of the swan; which, as his eyes are placedless prominent than those of other birds, for the convenience of puttingdown his head under water, prevents the rays of light from being reflectedinto his eye, and thus dazzling his sight, both in air and beneath thewater; which must have happened, if that surface had been white like therest of his feathers."|FALSE
15707|"There is a still more wonderful thing concerning these colours adapted tothe purpose of concealment; which is, that the eggs of birds are socoloured as to resemble the colour of the adjacent objects and theirinterfaces.

15707|"A thing still more astonishing is, that many animals in countries coveredwith snow become white in winter, and are said to change their colour againin the warmer months, as bears, hares, and partridges. Our domesticatedanimals lose their natural colours, and break into great variety, ashorses, dogs, pigeons. The final cause of these colours is easilyunderstood, as they serve some purposes of the animal, but the efficientcause would seem almost beyond conjecture."|FALSE

Now, when the ground becomes covered with snow, itwould seem, that that action of the retina, which is called whiteness,being constantly excited in the eye, may be gradually imitated by theextremities of the nerves of touch, or rete mucosum of the skin. And if itbe supposed, that the action of the retina in producing the perception ofany colour consists in so disposing its own fibres or surface, as toreflect those coloured rays only, and transmit the others likesoap-bubbles; then that part of the retina, which gives us the perceptionof snow, must at that time be white; and that which gives us the perceptionof grass, must be green."|FALSE
15707|"Then if by the laws of imitation, as explained in Section XII. 3. 3. andXXXIX. 6. the extremities of the nerves of touch in the rete mucosum beinduced into similar action, the skin or feathers, or hair, may in likemanner so dispose their extreme fibres, as to reflect white; for it isevident, that all these parts were originally obedient to irritativemotions during their growth, and probably continue to be so; that thoseirritative motions are not liable in a healthy state to be succeeded bysensation; which however is no uncommon thing in their diseased state, orin their infant state, as in plica polonica, and in very youngpen-feathers, which are still full of blood."|FALSE
15707|"It was shewn in Section XV. on the Production of Ideas, that the movingorgan of sense in some circumstances resembled the object which producedthat motion. Hence it may be conceived, that the rete mucosum, which is theextremity of the nerves of touch, may by imitating the motions of theretina become coloured. And thus, like the fable of the camelion, allanimals may possess a tendency to be coloured somewhat like the coloursthey most frequently inspect, and finally, that colours may be thus givento the egg-shell by the imagination of the female parent; which shell ispreviously a mucous membrane, indued with irritability, without which itcould not circulate its fluids, and increase in its bulk. Nor is this morewonderful than that a single idea of imagination mould in an instant colourthe whole surface of the body of a bright scarlet, as in the blush ofshame, though by a very different process. In this intricate subjectnothing but loose analogical conjectures can be had, which may however leadto future discoveries; but certain it is that both the change of the colourof animals to white in the winters of snowy countries, and the spots onbirds eggs, must have some efficient cause; since the uniformity of theirproduction shews it cannot arise from a fortuitous concurrence ofcircumstances; and how is this efficient cause to be detected, orexplained, but from its analogy to other animal facts?"|FALSE

Now as the firstfilament of entity cannot be furnished with the preparative organs abovementioned, the nutritive particles, which are at first to be received byit, are prepared by the mother; and deposited in the ovum ready for itsreception.

Whence it happens that, in thecopulation of animals of different species, the parts necessary to life arefrequently completely formed; but those for the purpose of generation aredefective, as requiring a nicer organization; or more exact coincidence ofthe particles of nutriment to the irritabilities or appetencies of theoriginal living filament.

There is a similaruniformity of effect in respect to the colour of the progeny producedbetween a white man, and a black woman, which, if I am well informed, isalways of the mulatto kind, or a mixture of the two; which may perhaps beimputed to the peculiar form of the particles of nutriment supplied to theembryon by the mother at the early period of its existence, and theirpeculiar stimulus; as this effect, like that of the mule progeny abovetreated of, is uniform and consistent, and cannot therefore be ascribed tothe imagination of either of the parents."|FALSE

15707|"When the embryon has produced a placenta, and furnished itself with vesselsfor selection of nutritious particles, and for oxygenation of them, nogreat change in its form or colour is likely to be produced by theparticles of sustenance it now takes from the fluid, in which it isimmersed; because it has now acquired organs to alter or new combine them.Hence it continues to grow, whether this fluid, in which it swims, beformed by the uterus or by any other cavity of the body, as inextra-uterine gestation; and which would seem to be produced by thestimulus of the fetus on the sides of the cavity, where it is found, asmentioned before. And thirdly, there is still less reason to expect anyunnatural change to happen to the child after its birth from the differenceof the milk it now takes; because it has acquired a stomach, and lungs, andglands, of sufficient power to decompose and recombine the milk; and thusto prepare from it the various kinds of nutritious particles, which theappetencies of the various fibrils or nerves may require."|FALSE
15707|"From all this reasoning I would conclude, that though the imagination ofthe female may be supposed to affect the embryon by producing a differencein its early nutriment; yet that no such power can affect it after it hasobtained a placenta, and other organs; which may select or change the food,which is presented to it either in the liquor amnii, or in the milk. Now asthe eggs in pullets, like the seeds in vegetables, are produced gradually,long before they are impregnated, it does not appear how any sudden effectof imagination of the mother at the time of impregnation can produce anyconsiderable change in the nutriment already thus laid up for the expectedor desired embryon. And that hence any changes of the embryon, except thoseuniform ones in the production of mules and mulattoes, more probably dependon the imagination of the male parent. At the same time it seems manifest,that those monstrous births, which consist in some deficiencies only, orsome redundancies of parts, originate from the deficiency or redundance ofthe first nutriment prepared in the ovary, or in the part of the eggimmediately surrounding the cicatricula, as described above; and whichcontinues some time to excite the first living filament into action, afterthe simple animal is completed; or ceases to excite it, before the completeform is accomplished. The former of these circumstances is evinced by theeggs with double yolks, which frequently happen to our domesticatedpoultry, and which, I believe, are so formed before impregnation, but whichwould be well worth attending to, both before and after impregnation; as itis probable, something valuable on this subject might be learnt from them.The latter circumstance, or that of deficiency of original nutriment, maybe deduced from reverse analogy."|FALSE
15707|"There are, however, other kinds of monstrous births, which neither dependon deficiency of parts, or supernumerary ones; nor are owing to theconjunction of animals of different species; but which appear to be newconformations, or new dispositions of parts in respect to each other, andwhich, like the variation of colours and forms of our domesticated animals,and probably the sexual parts of all animals, may depend on the imaginationof the male parent, which we now come to consider."|FALSE
15707|"VI. 1. The nice actions of the extremities of our various glands areexhibited in their various productions, which are believed to be made bythe gland, and not previously to exist as such in the blood."|FALSE
15707|"Thus the glands, which constitute the liver, make bile; those of thestomach make gastric acid; those beneath the jaw, saliva; those of theears, ear-wax; and the like. Every kind of gland must possess a peculiarirritability, and probably a sensibility, at the early state of itsexistence; and must be furnished with a nerve of sense, or of motion, toperceive, and to select, and to combine the particles, which compose thefluid it secretes. And this nerve of sense which perceives the differentarticles which compose the blood, must at least be conceived to be as fineand subtile an organ, as the optic or auditory nerve, which perceive lightor sound. See Sect. XIV. 9."|FALSE
15707|"But in nothing is this nice action of the extremities of the blood-vesselsso wonderful, as in the production of contagious matter. A small drop ofvariolous contagion diffused in the blood, or perhaps only by beinginserted beneath the cuticle, after a time, (as about a quarter of alunation,) excites the extreme vessels of the skin into certain motions,which produce a similar contagious material, filling with it a thousandpustules. So that by irritation, or by sensation in consequence ofirritation, or by association of motions, a material is formed by theextremities of certain cutaneous vessels, exactly similar to thestimulating material, which caused the irritation, or consequent sensation,or association."|FALSE
15707|"Many glands of the body have their motions, and in consequence theirsecreted fluids, affected by pleasurable or painful ideas, since they arein many instances influenced by sensitive associations, as well as by theirritations of the particles of the passing blood. Thus the idea of meat,excited in the minds of hungry dogs, by their sense of vision, or of smell,increases the discharge of saliva, both in quantity and viscidity; as isseen in its hanging down in threads from their mouths, as they stand rounda dinner-table. The sensations of pleasure, or of pain, of peculiar kinds,excite in the same manner a great discharge of tears; which appear also tobe more saline at the time of their secretion, from their inflaming theeyes and eye-lids. The paleness from fear, and the blush of shame, and ofjoy, are other instances of the effects of painful, or pleasurablesensations, on the extremities of the arterial system."|FALSE
15707|"It is probable, that the pleasurable sensation excited in the stomach byfood, as well as its irritation, contributes to excite into action thegastric glands, and to produce a greater secretion of their fluids. Thesame probably occurs in the secretion of bile; that is, that thepleasurable sensation excited in the stomach, affects this secretion bysensitive association, as well as by irritative association."|FALSE
15707|"And lastly it would seem, that all the glands in the body have theirsecreted fluids affected, in quantity and quality, by the pleasurable orpainful sensations, which produce or accompany those secretions. And thatthe pleasurable sensations arising from these secretions may constitute theunnamed pleasure of exigence, which is contrary to what is meant by tediumvitæ, or ennui; and by which we sometimes feel ourselves happy, withoutbeing able to ascribe it to any mental cause, as after an agreeable meal,or in the beginning of intoxication."|FALSE
15707|"Now it would appear, that no secretion or excretion of fluid is attendedwith so much agreeable sensation, as that of the semen; and it would thencefollow, that the glands, which perform this secretion, are more likely tobe much affected by their catenations with pleasurable sensations. Thiscircumstance is certain, that much more of this fluid is produced in agiven time, when the object of its exclusion is agreeable to the mind."|FALSE
15707|"2. A forceable argument, which shews the necessity of pleasurable sensationto copulation, is, that the act cannot be performed without it; it iseasily interrupted by the pain of fear or bashfulness; and no efforts ofvolition or of irritation can effect this process, except such as inducepleasurable ideas or sensations.

15707|"This wonderful circumstance of many insects being hermaphrodites, and atthe same time not having power to impregnate themselves, is attended to byDr. Lister, in his Exercitationes Anatom. de Limacibus, p. 145; who,amongst many other final causes, which he adduces to account for it, adds,ut tam tristibus et frigidis animalibus majori cum voluptate perficiaturvenus."|FALSE
15707|"There is, however, another final cause, to which this circumstance may beimputed: it was observed above, that vegetable buds and bulbs, which areproduced without a mother, are always exact resemblances of their parent;as appears in grafting fruit-trees, and in the flower-buds of the dioiceousplants, which are always of the same sex on the same tree; hence thosehermaphrodite insects, if they could have produced young without a mother,would not have been, capable of that change or improvement, which is seenin all other animals, and in those vegetables, which are procreated by themale embryon received and nourished by the female. And it is henceprobable, that if vegetables could only have been produced by buds andbulbs, and not by sexual generation, that there would not at this time haveexisted one thousandth part of their present number of species; which haveprobably been originally mule-productions; nor could any kind ofimprovement or change have happened to them, except by the difference ofsoil or climate."|FALSE

I conclude, that the imagination of the male at the time of copulation,or at the time of the secretion of the semen, may so affect this secretionby irritative or sensitive association, as described in No. 5. 1. of thissection, as to cause the production of similarity of form and of features,with the distinction of sex; as the motions of the chissel of the turnerimitate or correspond with those of the ideas of the artist. It is not hereto be understood, that the first living fibre, which is to form an animal,is produced with any similarity of form to the future animal; but withpropensities, or appetences, which shall produce by accretion of parts thesimilarity of form, feature, or sex, corresponding to the imagination ofthe father."|FALSE

And it is a preceding pleasurablesensation existing in my mind, which occasions me to produce thisparticular motion of the retina, when no triangle is present. Now it isprobable, that the acting fibres of the ultimate terminations of thesecreting apertures of the vessels of the testes, are as fine as those ofthe retina; and that they are liable to be thrown into that peculiaraction, which marks the sex of the secreted embryon, by sympathy with thepleasurable motions of the nerves of vision or of touch; that is, withcertain ideas of imagination. From hence it would appear, that the worldhas long been mistaken in ascribing great power to the imagination of thefemale, whereas from this account of it, the real power of imagination, inthe act of generation, belongs solely to the male. See Sect. XII. 3. 3."|FALSE
15707|"It may be objected to this theory, that a man may be supposed to have inhis mind, the idea of the form and features of the female, rather than hisown, and therefore there should be a greater number of female births. Onthe contrary, the general idea of our own form occurs to every one almostperpetually, and is termed consciousness of our existence, and thus mayeffect, that the number of males surpasses that of females. See Sect. XV.3. 4. and XVIII. 13. And what further confirms this idea is, that the malechildren most frequently resemble the father in form, or feature, as wellas in sex; and the female most frequently resemble the mother, in feature,and form, as well as in sex."|FALSE
15707|"It may again be objected, if a female child sometimes resembles the father,and a male child the mother, the ideas of the father, at the time ofprocreation, must suddenly change from himself to the mother, at the veryinstant, when the embryon is secreted or formed. This difficulty ceaseswhen we consider, that it is as easy to form an idea of feminine featureswith male organs of reproduction, or of male features with female ones, asthe contrary; as we conceive the idea of a sphinx or mermaid as easily andas distinctly as of a woman. Add to this, that at the time of procreationthe idea of the male organs, and of the female features, are often bothexcited at the same time, by contact, or by vision."|FALSE

Now what causecan occasionally produce the male or female character of the embryon, butthe peculiar actions of those glands, which form the embryon? And what caninfluence or govern these actions of the gland, but its associations orcatenations with other sensitive motions? Nor is this more extraordinary,than that the catenations of irritative motions with the apparentvibrations of objects at sea should produce sickness of the stomach; orthat a nauseous story should occasion vomiting."|FALSE
15707|"4. An argument, which evinces the effect of imagination on the firstrudiment of the embryon, may be deduced from the production of somepeculiar monsters. Such, for instance, as those which have two heads joinedto one body, and those which have two bodies joined to one head; of whichfrequent examples occur amongst our domesticated quadrupeds, and poultry.It is absurd to suppose, that such forms could exist in primordial germs,as explained in No. IV. 4. of this section. Nor is it possible, that suchdeformities could be produced by the growth of two embryons, or livingfilaments; which should afterwards adhere together; as the head and tailpart of different polypi are said to do (Blumenbach on Generation, Cadel,London); since in that case one embryon, or living filament, must havebegun to form one part first, and the other another part first. But suchmonstrous conformations become less difficult to comprehend, when they areconsidered as an effect of the imagination, as before explained, on theliving filament at the time of its secretion; and that such duplicature oflimbs were produced by accretion of new parts, in consequence ofpropensities, or animal appetencies thus acquired from the male parent."|FALSE
15707|"For instance, I can conceive, if a turkey-cock should behold a rabbit, or afrog, at the time of procreation, that it might happen, that a forcible oreven a pleasurable idea of the form of a quadruped might so occupy hisimagination, as to cause a tendency in the nascent filament to resemblesuch a form, by the apposition of a duplicature of limbs.

This effect ofimagination, of both the male and female parent, seems to have beenattended to in very early times; Jacob is said not only to have placed rodsof trees, in part stripped of their bark, so as to appear spotted, but alsoto have placed spotted lambs before the flocks, at the time of theircopulation.

In respect to the imagination of the mother, it is difficult tocomprehend, how this can produce any alteration in the fetus, except byaffecting the nutriment laid up for its first reception, as described inNo. V. 2. of this section, or by affecting the nourishment or oxygenationwith which she supplies it afterwards. Perpetual anxiety may probablyaffect the secretion of the liquor amnii into the uterus, as it enfeeblesthe whole system; and sudden fear is a frequent cause of miscarriage; forfear, contrary to joy, decreases for a time the action of the extremitiesof the arterial system; hence sudden paleness succeeds, and a shrinking orcontraction of the vessels of the skin, and other membranes. By thiscircumstance, I imagine, the terminations of the placental vessels aredetached from their adhesions, or insertions, into the membrane of theuterus; and the death of the child succeeds, and consequent miscarriage."|FALSE

She came with difficulty up stairs, began to flood immediately,and miscarried in a few hours. She has since borne several children, norever had any tendency to miscarry of any of them."|FALSE
15707|"6. In respect to the power of the imagination of the male over the form,colour, and sex of the progeny, the following instances have fallen undermy observation, and may perhaps be found not very unfrequent, if they weremore attended to. I am acquainted with a gentleman, who has one child withdark hair and eyes, though his lady and himself have light hair and eyes;and their other four children are like their parents. On observing thisdissimilarity of one child to the others he assured me, that he believed itwas his own imagination, that produced the difference; and related to methe following story. He said, that when his lady lay in of her third child,he became attached to a daughter of one of his inferior tenants, andoffered her a bribe for her favours in vain; and afterwards a greaterbribe, and was equally unsuccessful; that the form of this girl dwelt muchin his mind for some weeks, and that the next child, which was thedark-ey'd young lady above mentioned, was exceedingly like, in bothfeatures and colour, to the young woman who refused his addresses."|FALSE

I conclude, that the great desire of a male heir by the fatherproduced rather a disagreeable than an agreeable sensation; and that hisideas dwelt more on the fear of generating a female, than on thepleasurable sensations or ideas of his own male form or organs at the timeof copulation, or of the secretion of the semen; and that hence the idea ofthe female character was more present to his mind than that of the maleone; till at length in despair of generating a male these ideas ceased, andthose of the male character presided at the genial hour."|FALSE
15707|"7. Hence I conclude, that the act of generation cannot exist without beingaccompanied with ideas, and that a man must have at that time either ageneral idea of his own male form, or of the form of his male organs; or anidea of the female form, or of her organs; and that this marks the sex, andthe peculiar resemblances of the child to either parent. From whence itwould appear, that the phalli, which were hung round the necks of the Romanladies, or worn in their hair, might have effect in producing a greaterproportion of male children; and that the calipædia, or art of begettingbeautiful children, and of procreating either males or females, may betaught by affecting the imagination of the male-parent; that is, by thefine extremities of the seminal glands, imitating the actions of the organsof sense either of sight or touch.

In other cases, aduplicature of limbs are caused by the superabundance of this originalnutritive fluid, as in the double yolks of eggs, and the chickens from themwith four legs and four wings. But the production of other monsters, asthose with two heads, or with parts placed in wrong situations, seems toarise from the imagination of the father being in some manner imitated bythe extreme vessels of the seminal glands; as the colours of the spots oneggs, and the change of the colour of the hair and feathers of animals bydomestication, may be caused in the same manner by the imagination of themother."|FALSE

Now the changeof the configuration of the system of nature at this moment must be aneffect of the preceding configuration, for a change of configuration cannotexist without a previous configuration; and the proximate cause of everyeffect must immediately precede that effect.

The inert causes of motion, or newconfiguration, consist of the parts of matter, which are introduced withinthe spheres of activity of the principles above described. Thus, when anapple falls on the ground, the principle of gravitation is the efficientcause, and the matter of the apple the inert cause. If a bar of iron beapproximated to a magnet, it may be termed the inert cause of the motion,which brings these two bodies into contact; while the magnetic principlemay be termed the efficient cause.

In thissense of the words a magnet is said to attract iron; and the prick of aspur to stimulate a horse into exertion; so that in this view of the worksof nature all things may be said either simply to exist, or to exist ascauses, or to exist as effects; that is, to exist either in an active orpassive state."|FALSE

This is the source of one kind of the dark-coloured _muscævolitantes_. If this dark spot lies above the center of the eye, we turnour eyes that way, expecting to bring it into the center of the eye, thatwe may view it more distinctly; and in this case the dark spectrum seems tomove upwards. If the dark spectrum is found beneath the centre of the eye,we pursue it from the same motive, and it seems to move downwards. This hasgiven rise to various conjectures of something floating in the aqueoushumours of the eyes; but whoever, in attending to these spots, keeps hiseyes unmoved by looking steadily at the corner of a cloud, at the same timethat he observes the dark spectra, will be thoroughly convinced, that theyhave no motion but what is given to them by the movement of our eyes inpursuit of them. Sometimes the form of the spectrum, when it has beenreceived from a circular luminous body, will become oblong; and sometimesit will be divided into two circular spectra, which is not owing to ourchanging the angle made by the two optic axises, according to the distanceof the clouds or other bodies to which the spectrum is supposed to becontiguous, but to other causes mentioned in No. X. 3. of this section.

15707|"The twinkling of a bright star, or of a distant candle in the night, isperhaps owing to the same cause.

This pains the eye in a similar manner as when we come suddenlyfrom a dark room into bright daylight, and gives the appearance of brightscintillations. Hence the stars twinkle most when the night is darkest, anddo not twinkle through telescopes, as observed by Musschenbroeck; and itwill afterwards be seen why this twinkling is sometimes of differentcolours when the object is very bright, as Mr. Melvill observed in lookingat Sirius.

15707|"These circumstances, though they very much perplexed the experiments tillthey were investigated, admit of a satisfactory explanation; for while therays from the bright internal object in exp. a. fall with their full forceon the center of the retina, and, by fatiguing that part of it, induce thereverse spectrum, many scattered rays, from the same internal pink paper,fall on the more external parts of the retina, but not in such quantity asto occasion much fatigue, and hence induce the direct spectrum of the pinkcolour in those parts of the eye. The same reverse and direct spectra occurfrom the violet paper in exp. b.: and in exp. c. the scattered rays fromthe central pink paper produce a direct spectrum of this colour on theexternal parts of the eye, while the scattered rays from the external bluepaper produce a direct spectrum of that colour on the central part of theeye, instead of these parts of the retina falling reciprocally into theirreverse spectra. In exp. d. the colours being the reverse of each other,the scattered rays from the exterior object falling on the central parts ofthe eye, and there exciting their direct spectrum, at the same time thatthe retina was excited into a reverse spectrum by the central object, andthis direct and reverse spectrum being of similar colour, the superiorbrilliancy of this spectrum was produced.

For the same reasons, when an internal bright object wassmall, as in exp. f. instead of the whole of the spectrum of the externalobject being reverse to the colour of the internal object, only a kind ofhalo, or radiation of colour, similar to that of the internal object, wasspread a little way on the external spectrum.

The direct spectrum without any lateral light isan evanescent representation of its object in the unfatigued eye. 2. Withsome lateral light it becomes of a colour combined of the direct spectrumof the central object, and of the circumjacent objects, in proportion totheir respective quantity and brilliancy. 3. The reverse spectrum withoutlateral light is a representation in the fatigued eye of the form of itsobjects, with such a colour as would be produced by all the primarycolours, except that of the object. 4. With lateral light the colour iscompounded of the reverse spectrum of the central object, and the directspectrum of the circumjacent objects, in proportion to their respectivequantity and brilliancy."|FALSE

15707|"The reverse spectrum, as has been before explained, is similar to a colour,formed by a combination of all the primary colours, except that with whichthe eye has been fatigued in making the experiment: so the reverse spectrumof red is such a green as would be produced by a combination of all theother prismatic colours. Now it must be observed, that this reversespectrum of red is therefore the direct spectrum of a combination of allthe other prismatic colours, except the red; whence, on removing the eyefrom a piece of red silk to a sheet of white paper, the green spectrum,which is perceived, may either be called the reverse spectrum of the redsilk, or the direct spectrum of all the rays from the white paper, exceptthe red; for in truth it is both. Hence we see the reason why it is noteasy to gain a direct spectrum of any coloured object in the day-time,where there is much lateral light, except of very bright objects, as of thesetting sun, or by looking through an opake tube; because the lateralexternal light falling also on the central part of the retina, contributesto induce the reverse spectrum, which is at the same time the directspectrum of that lateral light, deducting only the colour of the centralobject which we have been viewing. And for the same reason, it is difficultto gain the reverse spectrum, where there is no lateral light to contributeto its formation. Thus, in looking through an opake tube on a yellow wall,and closing my eye, without admitting any lateral light, the spectra wereall at first yellow; but at length changed into blue. And on looking in thesame manner on red paper, I did at length get a green spectrum; but theywere all at first red ones: and the same after looking at a candle in thenight."|FALSE
15707|"The reverse spectrum was formed with greater facility when the eye wasthrown from the object on a sheet of white paper, or when light wasadmitted through the closed eyelids; because not only the fatigued part ofthe retina was inclined spontaneously to fall into motions of a contrarydirection; but being still sensible to all other rays of light except thatwith which it was lately fatigued, was by these rays stimulated at the sametime into those motions which form the reverse spectrum. Hence, when, thereverse spectrum of any colour became faint, it was wonderfully revived byadmitting more light through the eyelids, by removing the hand from beforethem: and hence, on covering the closed eyelids, the spectrum would oftencease for a time, till the retina became sensible to the stimulus of thesmaller quantity of light, and then it recurred. Nor was the spectrum onlychanged in vivacity, or in degree, by this admission of light through theeyelids; but it frequently happened, after having viewed bright objects,that the spectrum in the closed and covered eye was changed into a thirdspectrum, when light was admitted through the eyelids: which third spectrumwas composed of such colours as could pass through the eyelids, exceptthose of the object. Thus, when an area of half an inch diameter of pinkpaper was viewed on a sheet of white paper in the sunshine, the spectrumwith closed and covered eyes was green; but on removing the hands frombefore the closed eyelids, the spectrum became yellow, and returnedinstantly again to green, as often as the hands were applied to cover theeyelids, or removed from them: for the retina being now insensible to redlight, the yellow rays passing through the eyelids in greater quantity thanthe other colours, induced a yellow spectrum; whereas if the spectrum wasthrown on white paper, with the eyes open, it became only a lighter green."|FALSE
15707|"Though a certain quantity of light facilitates the formation of the reversespectrum, a greater quantity prevents its formation, as the more powerfulstimulus excites even the fatigued parts of the eye into action; otherwisewe should see the spectrum of the last viewed object as often as we turnour eyes. Hence the reverse spectra are best seen by gradually approachingthe hand near the closed eyelids to a certain distance only, which must bevaried with the brightness of the day, or the energy of the spectrum. Addto this, that all dark spectra, as black, blue, or green, if light beadmitted through the eyelids, after they have been some time covered, givereddish spectra, for the reasons given in Sect. III. Exp. 1."|FALSE
15707|"From these circumstances of the extraneous light coinciding with thespontaneous efforts of the fatigued retina to produce a reverse spectrum,as was observed before, it is not easy to gain a direct spectrum, except ofobjects brighter than the ambient light; such as a candle in the night, thesetting sun, or viewing a bright object through an opake tube; and then thereverse spectrum is instantaneously produced by the admission of someexternal light; and is as instantly converted again to the direct spectrumby the exclusion of it. Thus, on looking at the setting sun, on closing theeyes, and covering them, a yellow spectrum is seen, which is the directspectrum of the setting sun; but on opening the eyes on the sky, the yellowspectrum is immediately changed into a blue one, which is the reversespectrum of the yellow sun, or the direct spectrum of the blue sky, or acombination of both. And this is again transformed into a yellow one onclosing the eyes, and so reciprocally, as quick as the motions of theopening and closing eyelids. Hence, when Mr. Melvill observed thescintillations of the star Sirius to be sometimes coloured, these wereprobably the direct spectrum of the blue sky on the parts of the retinafatigued by the white light of the star.

15707|"When a direct spectrum is thrown on colours darker than itself, it mixeswith them; as the yellow spectrum of the setting sun, thrown on the greengrass, becomes a greener yellow. But when a direct spectrum is thrown oncolours brighter than itself, it becomes instantly changed into the reversespectrum, which mixes with those brighter colours. So the yellow spectrumof the setting sun thrown on the luminous sky becomes blue, and changeswith the colour or brightness of the clouds on which it appears. But thereverse spectrum mixes with every kind of colour on which it is thrown,whether brighter than itself or not; thus the reverse spectrum, obtained byviewing a piece of yellow silk, when thrown on white paper, was a lucidblue green; when thrown on black Turkey leather, becomes a deep violet. Andthe spectrum of blue silk, thrown on white paper, was a light yellow; onblack silk was an obscure orange; and, the blue spectrum, obtained fromorange-coloured silk, thrown on yellow, became a green."|FALSE
15707|"In these cases the retina is thrown into activity or sensation by thestimulus of external colours, at the same time that it continues theactivity or sensation which forms the spectra; in the same manner as theprismatic colours, painted on a whirling top, are seen to mix together.When these colours of external objects are brighter than the directspectrum which is thrown upon them, they change it into the reversespectrum, like the admission of external light on a direct spectrum, asexplained above. When they are darker than the direct spectrum, they mixwith it, their weaker stimulus being inefficient to induce the reversespectrum."|FALSE

15707|"When we look long and attentively at any object, the eye cannot always bekept entirely motionless; hence, on inspecting a circular area of red silkplaced on white paper, a lucid crescent or edge is seen to librate on oneside or other of the red circle: for the exterior parts of the retinasometimes falling on the edge of the central silk, and sometimes on thewhite paper, are less fatigued with red light than the central part of theretina, which is constantly, exposed to it; and therefore, when they fallon the edge of the red silk, they perceive it more vividly. Afterwards,when the eye becomes fatigued, a green spectrum in the form of a crescentis seen to librate on one side or other of the central circle, as by theunsteadiness of the eye a part of the fatigued retina falls on the whitepaper; and as by the increasing fatigue of the eye the central part of thesilk appears paler, the edge on which the unfatigued part of the retinaoccasionally falls will appear of a deeper red than the original silk,because it is compared with the pale internal part of it. M. de Buffon inmaking this experiment observed, that the red edge of the silk was not onlydeeper coloured than the original silk; but, on his retreating a littlefrom it, it became oblong, and at length divided into two, which must havebeen owing to his observing it either before or behind the point ofintersection of the two optic axises. Thus, if a pen is held up before adistant candle, when we look intensely at the pen two candles are seenbehind it; when we look intensely at the candle two pens are seen. If thesight be unsteady at the time of beholding the sun, even though one eyeonly be used, many images of the sun will appear, or luminous lines, whenthe eye is closed. And as some parts of these will be more vivid thanothers, and some parts of them will be produced nearer the center of theeye than others, these will disappear sooner than the others; and hence thenumber and shape of these spectra of the sun will continually vary, as longas they exist. The cause of some being more vivid than others, is theunsteadiness of the eye of the beholder, so that some parts of the retinahave been longer exposed to the sunbeams. That some parts of a complicatedspectrum fade and return before other parts of it, the following experimentevinces. Draw three concentric circles; the external one an inch and a halfin diameter, the middle one an inch, and the internal one half an inch;colour the external and internal areas blue, and the remaining one yellow,as in Fig. 4.; after having looked about a minute on the center of thesecircles, in a bright light, the spectrum of the external area appears firstin the closed eye, then the middle area, and lastly the central one; andthen the central one disappears, and the others in inverted order. Ifconcentric circles of more colours are added, it produces the beautifulever changing spectrum in Sect. I. Exp. 2."|FALSE
15707|"From hence it would seem, that the center of the eye produces quickerremissions of spectra, owing perhaps to its greater sensibility; that is,to its more energetic exertions.

The meridian or evening light makes a difference in the colours of somespectra; for as the sun descends, the red rays, which are less refrangibleby the convex atmosphere, abound in great quantity. Whence the spectrum ofthe light parts of a window at this time, or early in the morning, is red;and becomes blue either a little later or earlier; and white in themeridian day; and is also variable from the colour of the clouds or skywhich are opposed to the window."|FALSE
15707|"2. All these experiments are liable to be confounded, if they are made toosoon after each other, as the remaining spectrum will mix with the newones. This is a very troublesome circumstance to painters, who are obligedto look long upon the same colour; and in particular to those whose eyes,from natural debility, cannot long, continue the same kind of exertion. Forthe same reason, in making these experiments, the result becomes muchvaried if the eyes, after viewing any object, are removed on other objectsfor but an instant of time, before we close them to view the spectrum; forthe light from the object, of which we had only a transient view, in thevery time of closing our eyes acts as a stimulus on the fatigued retina;and for a time prevents the defined spectrum from appearing, or mixes itsown spectrum with it. Whence, after the eyelids are closed, either a darkfield, or some unexpected colours, are beheld for a few seconds, before thedesired spectrum becomes distinctly visible."|FALSE
15707|"3. The length of time taken up in viewing an object, of which we are toobserve the spectrum, makes a great difference in the appearance of thespectrum, not only in its vivacity, but in its colour; as the directspectrum of the central object, or of the circumjacent ones, and also thereverse spectra of both, with their various combinations, as well as thetime of their duration in the eye, and of their remissions or alternations,depend upon the degree of fatigue the retina is subjected to. The Chevalierd'Arcy constructed a machine by which a coal of fire was whirled round inthe dark, and found, that when a luminous body made a revolution in eightthirds of time, it presented to the eye a complete circle of fire; fromwhence he concludes, that the impression continues on the organ about theseventh part of a second. (Mem. de l'Acad. des Sc. 1765.) This, however, isonly to be considered as the shortest time of the duration of these directspectra; since in the fatigued eye both the direct and reverse spectra,with their intermissions, appear to take up many seconds of time, and seemvery variable in proportion to the circumstances of fatigue or energy."|FALSE
15707|"4. It sometimes happens, if the eyeballs have been rubbed hard with thefingers, that lucid sparks are seen in quick motion amidst the spectrum weare attending to. This is similar to the flashes of fire from a stroke onthe eye in fighting, and is resembled by the warmth and glow, which appearsupon the skin after friction, and is probably owing to an acceleration ofthe arterial blood into the vessels emptied by the previous pressure. Bybeing accustomed to observe such small sensations in the eye, it is easy tosee the circulation of the blood in this organ. I have attended to thisfrequently, when I have observed my eyes more than commonly sensible toother spectra. The circulation may be seen either in both eyes at a time,or only in one of them; for as a certain quantity of light is necessary toproduce this curious phenomenon, if one hand be brought nearer the closedeyelids than the other, the circulation in that eye will for a timedisappear. For the easier viewing the circulation, it is sometimesnecessary to rub the eyes with a certain degree of force after they areclosed, and to hold the breath rather longer than is agreeable, which, byaccumulating more blood in the eye, facilitates the experiment; but ingeneral it may be seen distinctly after having examined other spectra withyour back to the light, till the eyes become weary; then having coveredyour closed eyelids for half a minute, till the spectrum is faded awaywhich you were examining, turn your face to the light, and removing yourhands from the eyelids, by and by again shade them a little, and thecirculation becomes curiously distinct. The streams of blood are howevergenerally seen to unite, which shews it to be the venous circulation,owing, I suppose, to the greater opacity of the colour of the blood inthese vessels; for this venous circulation is also much more easily seen bythe microscope in the tail of a tadpole."|FALSE

15707|"1. It was before observed, that when the two colours viewed together wereopposite to each other, as yellow and blue, red and green, &c. according tothe table of reflections and transmissions of light in Sir Isaac Newton'sOptics, B. II. Fig. 3. the spectra of those colours were of all others themost brilliant, and best defined; because they were combined of the reversespectrum of one colour, and of the direct spectrum of the other. Hence, inbooks printed with small types, or in the minute graduation ofthermometers, or of clock-faces, which are to be seen at a distance, if theletters or figures are coloured with orange, and the ground with indigo; orthe letters with red, and the ground with green; or any other lucid colouris used for the letters, the spectrum of which is similar to the colour ofthe ground; such letters will be seen much more distinctly, and with lessconfusion, than in black or white: for as the spectrum of the letter is thesame colour with the ground on which they are seen, the unsteadiness of theeye in long attending to them will not produce coloured lines by the edgesof the letters, which is the principal cause of their confusion. The beautyof colours lying in vicinity to each other, whose spectra are thusreciprocally similar to each colour, is owing to this greater ease that theeye experiences in beholding them distinctly; and it is probable, in theorgan of hearing, a similar circumstance may constitute the pleasure ofmelody. Sir Isaac Newton observes, that gold and indigo were agreeable whenviewed together; and thinks there may be some analogy between thesensations of light and sound. (Optics, Qu. 14.)"|FALSE
15707|"In viewing the spectra of bright objects, as of an area of red silk of halfan inch diameter on white paper, it is easy to magnify it to tenfold itssize: for if, when the spectrum is formed, you still keep your eye fixed onthe silk area, and remove it a few inches further from you, a green circleis seen round the red silk: for the angle now subtended by the silk is lessthan it was when the spectrum was formed, but that of the spectrumcontinues the same, and our imagination places them at the same distance.Thus when you view a spectrum on a sheet of white paper, if you approachthe paper to the eye, you may diminish it to a point; and if the paper ismade to recede from the eye, the spectrum will appear magnified inproportion to the distance."|FALSE

A kind of net-work, darkerthan the other parts of the wall, appears and vanishes alternately withevery pulsation. This change of the colour of the wall he well ascribes tothe compression of the retina by the diastole of the artery. The variouscolours produced in the eye by the pressure of the finger, or by a strokeon it, as mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton, seem likewise to originate fromthe unequal pressure on various parts of the retina. Now as Sir IsaacNewton has shewn, that all the different colours are reflected ortransmitted by the laminæ of soap bubbles, or of air, according to theirdifferent thickness or thinness, is it not probable, that the effect of theactivity of the retina may be to alter its thickness or thinness, so asbetter to adapt it to reflect or transmit the colours which stimulate itinto action? May not muscular fibres exist in the retina for this purpose,which may be less minute than the locomotive muscles of microscopicanimals? May not these muscular actions of the retina constitute thesensation of light and colours; and the voluntary repetitions of them, whenthe object is withdrawn, constitute our memory of them? And lastly, may notthe laws of the sensations of light, here investigated, be applicable toall our other senses, and much contribute to elucidate many phenomena ofanimal bodies both in their healthy and diseased state; and thus renderthis investigation well worthy the attention of the physician, themetaphysician, and the natural philosopher?"|FALSE
