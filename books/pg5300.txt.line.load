5300|"Jean de La Fontaine was born on the 8th of July, 1621, at"|FALSE
5300|"Chateau-Thierry, and his family held a respectable position there."|FALSE
5300|"His education was neglected, but he had received that genius which makes"|FALSE
5300|"amends for all.  While still young the tedium of society led him into"|FALSE
5300|"retirement, from which a taste for independence afterwards withdrew him."|FALSE
5300|"He had reached the age of twenty-two, when a few sounds from the lyre of"|FALSE
5300|"Malherbe, heard by accident, awoke in him the muse which slept."|FALSE
5300|"He soon became acquainted with the best models: Pheedrus, Virgil, Horace"|FALSE
5300|"and Terence amongst the Latins; Plutarch, Homer and Plato, amongst the"|FALSE
5300|"Greeks; Rabelais, Marot and d'Urfe, amongst the French; Tasso, Ariosto"|FALSE
5300|"and Boccaccio, amongst the Italians."|FALSE
5300|"He married, in compliance with the wishes of his family, a beautiful,"|FALSE
5300|"witty and chaste woman, who drove him to despair."|FALSE
5300|"He was sought after and cherished by all distinguished men of letters."|FALSE
5300|"But it was two Ladies who kept him from experiencing the pangs of"|FALSE
5300|"poverty."|FALSE
5300|"La Fontaine, if there remain anything of thee, and if it be permitted to"|FALSE
5300|"thee for a moment to soar above all time; see the names of La Sabliere"|FALSE
5300|"and of Hervard pass with thine to the ages to come!"|FALSE
5300|"The life of La Fontaine was, so to speak, only one of continual"|FALSE
5300|"distraction.  In the midst of society, he was absent from it.  Regarded"|FALSE
5300|"almost as an imbecile by the crowd, this clever author, this amiable man,"|FALSE
5300|"only permitted himself to be seen at intervals and by friends."|FALSE
5300|"He had few books and few friends."|FALSE
5300|"Amongst a large number of works that he has left, everyone knows his"|FALSE
5300|"fables and his tales, and the circumstances of his life are written in"|FALSE
5300|"a hundred places."|FALSE
5300|"He died on the 16th of March, 1695."|FALSE
5300|"Let us keep silence about his last moments, for fear of irritating those"|FALSE
5300|"who never forgive."|FALSE
5300|"His fellow-citizens honour him in his posterity to this day."|FALSE
5300|"Long after his death, foreigners went to visit the room which he had"|FALSE
5300|"occupied."|FALSE
5300|"Once a year, I shall go to visit his tomb."|FALSE
5300|"On that day, I shall tear up a fable of La Mothe, a tale of Vergier, or"|FALSE
5300|"several of the best pages of Grecourt."|FALSE
5300|"He was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Joseph, by the side of Moliere."|FALSE
5300|"That spot will always be held sacred by poets and people of taste."|FALSE
5300|"                          THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE"|FALSE
5300|"                   TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF THESE TALES"|FALSE
5300|"I had resolved not to consent to the printing of these Tales, until after"|FALSE
5300|"I had joined to them those of Boccaccio, which are those most to my"|FALSE
5300|"taste; but several persons have advised me to produce at once what I"|FALSE
5300|"have remaining of these trifles, in order to prevent from cooling the"|FALSE
5300|"curiosity to see them, which is still in its first ardour.  I gave way to"|FALSE
5300|"this advice without much difficulty, and I have thought well to profit by"|FALSE
5300|"the occasion.  Not only is that permitted me, but it would be vanity on"|FALSE
5300|"my part to despise such an advantage.  It has sufficed me to wish that no"|FALSE
5300|"one should be imposed upon in my favour, and to follow a road contrary to"|FALSE
5300|"that of certain persons, who only make friends in order to gain voices in"|FALSE
5300|"their favour by their means; creatures of the Cabal, very different from"|FALSE
5300|"that Spaniard who prided himself on being the son of his own works."|FALSE
5300|"Although I may still be as much in want of these artifices as any other"|FALSE
5300|"person, I cannot bring myself to resolve to employ them; however I shall"|FALSE
5300|"accommodate myself if possible to the taste of the times, instructed as I"|FALSE
5300|"am by my own experience, that there is nothing which is more necessary."|FALSE
5300|"Indeed one cannot say that all seasons are suitable for all classes of"|FALSE
5300|"books.  We have seen the Roundelays, the Metamorphoses, the Crambos,"|FALSE
5300|"reign one after another.  At present, these gallantries are out of date"|FALSE
5300|"and nobody cares about them: so certain is it that what pleases at one"|FALSE
5300|"time may not please at another!  It only belongs to works of truly solid"|FALSE
5300|"merit and sovereign beauty, to be well received by all minds and in all"|FALSE
5300|"ages, without possessing any other passport than the sole merit with"|FALSE
5300|"which they are filled.  As mine are so far distant from such a high"|FALSE
5300|"degree of perfection, prudence advises that I should keep them in my"|FALSE
5300|"cabinet unless I choose well my own time for producing them.  This is"|FALSE
5300|"what I have done, or what I have tried to do in this edition, in which"|FALSE
5300|"I have only added new Tales, because it seemed to me that people were"|FALSE
5300|"prepared to take pleasure in them.  There are some which I have extended,"|FALSE
5300|"and others which I have abridged, only for the sake of diversifying them"|FALSE
5300|"and making them less tedious.  But I am occupying myself over matters"|FALSE
5300|"about which perhaps people will take no notice, whilst I have reason to"|FALSE
5300|"apprehend much more important objections.  There are only two principal"|FALSE
5300|"ones which can be made against me; the one that this book is licentious;"|FALSE
5300|"the other that it does not sufficiently spare the fair sex.  With regard"|FALSE
5300|"to the first, I say boldly that the nature of what is understood as a"|FALSE
5300|"tale decided that it should be so, it being an indispensable law"|FALSE
5300|"according to Horace, or rather according to reason and common sense, that"|FALSE
5300|"one must conform one's self to the nature of the things about which one"|FALSE
5300|"writes.  Now, that I should be permitted to write about these as so many"|FALSE
5300|"others have done and with success I do not believe it can be doubted; and"|FALSE
5300|"people cannot condemn me for so doing, without also condemning Ariosto"|FALSE
5300|"before me and the Ancients before Ariosto.  It may be said that I should"|FALSE
5300|"have done better to have suppressed certain details, or at least to have"|FALSE
5300|"disguised them.  Nothing was more easy, but it would have weakened the"|FALSE
5300|"tale and taken away  some of its charm: So much circumspection is only"|FALSE
5300|"necessary in works which promise great discretion from the beginning,"|FALSE
5300|"either by their subject or by the manner in which they are treated.  I"|FALSE
5300|"confess that it is necessary to keep within certain limits, and that the"|FALSE
5300|"narrowest are the best; also it must be allowed me that to be too"|FALSE
5300|"scrupulous would spoil all.  He who would wish to reduce Boccaccio to the"|FALSE
5300|"same modesty as Virgil, would assuredly produce nothing worth having, and"|FALSE
5300|"would sin against the laws of propriety by setting himself the task to"|FALSE
5300|"observe them.  For in order that one may not make a mistake in matters"|FALSE
5300|"of verse and prose, extreme modesty and propriety are two very different"|FALSE
5300|"things.  Cicero makes the latter consist in saying what is appropriate"|FALSE
5300|"one should say, considering the place, the time, and the persons to whom"|FALSE
5300|"one is speaking.  This principle once admitted,  it is not a fault of"|FALSE
5300|"judgment to entertain the people of to-day with Tales which are a little"|FALSE
5300|"broad.  Neither do I sin in that against morality.  If there is anything"|FALSE
5300|"in our writings which is capable of making an impression on the mind, it"|FALSE
5300|"is by no means the gaiety of these Tales; it passes off lightly; I should"|FALSE
5300|"rather fear a tranquil melancholy, into which the most chaste and modest"|FALSE
5300|"novels are very capable of plunging us, and which  is a great preparation"|FALSE
5300|"for love.  As to the second objection, by which people reproach me that"|FALSE
5300|"this book does wrong to womankind, they would be right if I were"|FALSE
5300|"speaking seriously: but who does not see that this is all in jest,"|FALSE
5300|"and consequently cannot injure?  We must not be afraid on that account"|FALSE
5300|"that marriages in the future will be less frequent, and husbands more on"|FALSE
5300|"their guard.  It may still be objected that these Tales are unfounded or"|FALSE
5300|"that they have everywhere a foundation easy to destroy; in short that"|FALSE
5300|"they are absurdities and have not the least tinge of probability."|FALSE
5300|"I reply in a few words that I have my authorities: and besides it is"|FALSE
5300|"neither truth nor probability which makes the beauty and the charm of"|FALSE
5300|"these Tales: it is only the manner of telling them.  These are the"|FALSE
5300|"principal points on which I have thought it necessary to defend myself."|FALSE
5300|"I abandon the rest to the censors; the more so as it would be an infinite"|FALSE
5300|"undertaking to pretend to reply to all.  Criticism never stops short nor"|FALSE
5300|"ever wants for subjects on which to exercise itself: even if those I am"|FALSE
5300|"able to foresee were taken from it, it would soon have discovered others."|FALSE

5300|"into narratives as dull as they are grand, into straits that are utterly"|FALSE
5300|"useless, and would make him disregard the pleasure of the heart in order"|FALSE
5300|"to labour for the gratification of the ear.  We must leave studied"|FALSE
5300|"narrative for lofty subjects, and not compose an epic poem of the"|FALSE
5300|"Adventures of Renaud d'Ast.  Suppose the Author, who has put these tales"|FALSE
5300|"into rhyme, had brought to bear on them all the care and preciseness"|FALSE
5300|"required of him; not only would this care be observed, especially as it"|FALSE
5300|"is unnecessary, but it would also transgress the precept lain down by"|FALSE
5300|"Ouintilian, still the Author would not have attained the main object,"|FALSE
5300|"which is to interest the reader, to charm him, to rivet his attention"|FALSE
5300|"in spite of himself,--in a word, to please him.  As everybody knows, the"|FALSE
5300|"secret of pleasing the reader is not always based on regulation, nor even"|FALSE
5300|"on symmetry; there is need of smartness and tastefulness, if we would"|FALSE
5300|"strike home.  How many of those perfect types of beauty do we see which"|FALSE
5300|"never strike home, and of which nobody feels enamoured!  We do not wish"|FALSE
5300|"to rob Modern Authors of the praise that is due to them.  Nicely turned"|FALSE
5300|"lines, fine language, accuracy, elegance of rhyme are accomplishments in"|FALSE
5300|"a poet. However that may be, let us consider  of our own epigrams wherein"|FALSE
5300|"all these qualities are combined, perhaps we shall find in them far less"|FALSE
5300|"point, nay, I would venture to add, far less  charm than in those of"|FALSE
5300|"Marot or Saint-Gelais, although almost all the works of the latter poets"|FALSE
5300|"are full of the same faults as are attributed to us.  We will be told"|FALSE
5300|"that these were not faults in their day, whereas they are very great"|FALSE
5300|"faults in ours.  To this we answer by a similar kind of argument, by"|FALSE
5300|"saying, as we have already said, that these would undoubtedly be faults"|FALSE
5300|"in another style of  poetry, but not in this.  The late M. de Voiture is"|FALSE
5300|"a proof in point. We need only read the works in which he brings to life"|FALSE
5300|"again the character of Marot.  For our Author does not lay claim to"|FALSE
5300|"praise for himself, nor to rounds of applause from the public for having"|FALSE
5300|"put a few tales into rhyme.  Without doubt he has entered on quite a new"|FALSE
5300|"path, and has pursued it to the utmost of his power, choosing now one"|FALSE
5300|"road, now another, and always treading with surer step when he has"|FALSE
5300|"followed the manner of our old poets \"quorum in hae re imitari"|FALSE
5300|"negligentiam exoptat potius quam istorum diligentiam.\""|FALSE
5300|"But while saying that we wished to waive this question, we have"|FALSE
5300|"unconsciously involved ourselves in its discussion.  Perhaps this has not"|FALSE
5300|"been without advantage; for there is nothing that resembles faults more"|FALSE
5300|"than these licenses.  Let us now consider the liberty which the Author"|FALSE
5300|"has assumed in cutting into the property of others as well as  his own,"|FALSE
5300|"without making exception even to the  best known stories, none of which"|FALSE
5300|"he scruples to tamper with.  He curtails, enlarges, and alters incidents"|FALSE
5300|"and details, at times the main issue and the sequel; in short, the story"|FALSE
5300|"is no longer the same;  it is, in point of fact, quite a new tale; its"|FALSE
5300|"original author would find it no small difficulty to recognise in it his"|FALSE
5300|"own work. \"Non sic decet contaminari  fabulas,\" Critics will say.  Why"|FALSE
5300|"should they not?  They twitted Terence in just the same way; but Terence"|FALSE
5300|"sneered at them, and claimed a right to treat the matter as he did.  He"|FALSE
5300|"has mingled his own ideas with the subjects he drew from Menander, just"|FALSE
5300|"as Sophocles and Euripides mingled theirs with the subjects they drew"|FALSE
5300|"from former writers, sparing neither history nor romance, where \"decorum\""|FALSE
5300|"and the rules of the Drama were at issue.  Shall this privilege cease"|FALSE
5300|"with respect to fictitious stories?  Must we in future have more"|FALSE
5300|"scrupulous or religious regard, if we may be allowed the expression,"|FALSE
5300|"for falsehood than the Ancients had for truth?  What people call a good"|FALSE
5300|"tale never passes from hand to hand without receiving some fresh touch"|FALSE
5300|"of embellishment.  How comes it then, we may be asked, that in many"|FALSE
5300|"passages the Author curtails instead of enlarging on the original?"|FALSE
5300|"On that point we are agreed:  the Author does so in order to avoid"|FALSE
5300|"lengthiness and ambiguity,--two faults which are inadmissible in such"|FALSE
5300|"matters, especially the latter.  For if lucidity is to be commended in"|FALSE
5300|"all literary works, we may say that it is especially necessary in"|FALSE
5300|"narratives, where one thing is, as a rule, the sequel and the result of"|FALSE
5300|"another; where the less important sometimes lays the basis of the more"|FALSE
5300|"important; so that, once the thread becomes broken, the reader cannot"|FALSE
5300|"gather it up again.  Besides, as narratives in verse are very awkward,"|FALSE
5300|"the author must clog himself with details as little as possible; by means"|FALSE
5300|"of this you relieve not only yourself, but also the reader, for whom an"|FALSE
5300|"author should not fail to prepare pleasure unalloyed.  Whenever the"|FALSE
5300|"Author has altered a few particulars and even a few catastrophes, he has"|FALSE
5300|"been forced to do so by the cause of that catastrophe and the urgency of"|FALSE
5300|"giving it a happy termination. He has fancied that in tales of this kind"|FALSE
5300|"everyone ought to be satisfied with the end: it pleases the reader at"|FALSE
5300|"any rate, if the author has not given the characters too distasteful"|FALSE
5300|"a rendering.  But he must not go so far as that, if possible, nor make"|FALSE
5300|"the reader laugh and cry in the same tale.  This medley shocks Horace"|FALSE
5300|"above all things; his wish is not that our works should border on the"|FALSE
5300|"grotesque, and that we should draw a picture half woman half fish.  These"|FALSE
5300|"are the general motives the Author has had in view.  We might still quote"|FALSE
5300|"special motives and vindicate each point; but we must needs leave"|FALSE
5300|"something to the capacity and leniency of our readers.  They will be"|FALSE
5300|"satisfied, then, with the motives we have mentioned.  We would have"|FALSE
5300|"stated them more clearly and have set more by them, had the general"|FALSE
5300|"compass of a Preface so allowed."|FALSE
