16452|"Whether a translation of HOMER may be best executed in blank verse or"|FALSE
16452|"in rhyme, is a question in the decision of which no man can find"|FALSE
16452|"difficulty, who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be,"|FALSE
16452|"or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very"|FALSE
16452|"different kinds of versification. I will venture to assert that a just"|FALSE
16452|"translation of any ancient poet in rhyme, is impossible. No human"|FALSE
16452|"ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with"|FALSE
16452|"sounds homotonous, expressing at the same time the full sense, and"|FALSE
16452|"only the full sense of his original. The translator's ingenuity,"|FALSE
16452|"indeed, in this case becomes itself a snare, and the readier he is at"|FALSE
16452|"invention and expedient, the more likely he is to be betrayed into the"|FALSE
16452|"widest departures from the guide whom he professes to follow. Hence it"|FALSE
16452|"has happened, that although the public have long been in possession of"|FALSE
16452|"an English HOMER by a poet whose writings have done immortal honor to"|FALSE
16452|"his country, the demand of a new one, and especially in blank verse,"|FALSE
16452|"has been repeatedly and loudly made by some of the best judges and"|FALSE
16452|"ablest writers of the present day."|FALSE
16452|"I have no contest with my predecessor. None is supposable between"|FALSE
16452|"performers on different instruments. Mr. Pope has surmounted all"|FALSE
16452|"difficulties in his version of HOMER that it was possible to surmount"|FALSE
16452|"in rhyme. But he was fettered, and his fetters were his choice."|FALSE
16452|"Accustomed always to rhyme, he had formed to himself an ear which"|FALSE
16452|"probably could not be much gratified by verse that wanted it, and"|FALSE
16452|"determined to encounter even impossibilities, rather than abandon a"|FALSE
16452|"mode of writing in which he had excelled every body, for the sake of"|FALSE
16452|"another to which, unexercised in it as he was, he must have felt"|FALSE
16452|"strong objections."|FALSE
16452|"I number myself among the warmest admirers of Mr. Pope as an original"|FALSE
16452|"writer, and I allow him all the merit he can justly claim as the"|FALSE
16452|"translator of this chief of poets. He has given us the _Tale of Troy"|FALSE
16452|"divine_ in smooth verse, generally in correct and elegant language,"|FALSE
16452|"and in diction often highly poetical. But his deviations are so many,"|FALSE
16452|"occasioned chiefly by the cause already mentioned, that, much as he"|FALSE
16452|"has done, and valuable as his work is on some accounts, it was yet in"|FALSE
16452|"the humble province of a translator that I thought it possible even"|FALSE
16452|"for me to fellow him with some advantage."|FALSE
16452|"That he has sometimes altogether suppressed the sense of his author,"|FALSE
16452|"and has not seldom intermingled his own ideas with it, is a remark"|FALSE
16452|"which, on this occasion, nothing but necessity should have extorted"|FALSE
16452|"from me. But we differ sometimes so widely in our matter, that unless"|FALSE
16452|"this remark, invidious as it seems, be premised, I know not how to"|FALSE
16452|"obviate a suspicion, on the one hand, of careless oversight, or of"|FALSE
16452|"factitious embellishment on the other. On this head, therefore, the"|FALSE
16452|"English reader is to be admonished, that the matter found in me,"|FALSE
16452|"whether he like it or not, is found also in HOMER, and that the matter"|FALSE
16452|"not found in me, how much soever he may admire it, is found only in"|FALSE
16452|"Mr. Pope. I have omitted nothing; I have invented nothing."|FALSE
16452|"There is indisputably a wide difference between the case of an"|FALSE
16452|"original writer in rhyme and a translator. In an original work the"|FALSE
16452|"author is free; if the rhyme be of difficult attainment, and he cannot"|FALSE
16452|"find it in one direction, he is at liberty to seek it in another; the"|FALSE
16452|"matter that will not accommodate itself to his occasions he may"|FALSE
16452|"discard, adopting such as will. But in a translation no such option is"|FALSE
16452|"allowable; the sense of the author is required, and we do not"|FALSE
16452|"surrender it willingly even to the plea of necessity. Fidelity is"|FALSE
16452|"indeed of the very essence of translation, and the term itself implies"|FALSE
16452|"it. For which reason, if we suppress the sense of our original, and"|FALSE
16452|"force into its place our own, we may call our work an _imitation_, if"|FALSE
16452|"we please, or perhaps a _paraphrase_, but it is no longer the same"|FALSE
16452|"author only in a different dress, and therefore it is not translation."|FALSE
16452|"Should a painter, professing to draw the likeness of a beautiful"|FALSE
16452|"woman, give her more or fewer features than belong to her, and a"|FALSE
16452|"general cast of countenance of his own invention, he might be said to"|FALSE
16452|"have produced a _jeu d'esprit_, a curiosity perhaps in its way, but by"|FALSE
16452|"no means the lady in question."|FALSE
16452|"It will however be necessary to speak a little more largely to this"|FALSE
16452|"subject, on which discordant opinions prevail even among good judges."|FALSE
16452|"The free and the close translation have, each, their advocates. But"|FALSE
16452|"inconveniences belong to both. The former can hardly be true to the"|FALSE
16452|"original author's style and manner, and the latter is apt to be"|FALSE
16452|"servile. The one loses his peculiarities, and the other his spirit."|FALSE
16452|"Were it possible, therefore, to find an exact medium, a manner so"|FALSE
16452|"close that it should let slip nothing of the text, nor mingle any"|FALSE
16452|"thing extraneous with it, and at the same time so free as to have an"|FALSE
16452|"air of originality, this seems precisely the mode in which an author"|FALSE
16452|"might be best rendered. I can assure my readers from my own"|FALSE
16452|"experience, that to discover this very delicate line is difficult, and"|FALSE
16452|"to proceed by it when found, through the whole length of a poet"|FALSE
16452|"voluminous as HOMER, nearly impossible. I can only pretend to have"|FALSE
16452|"endeavored it."|FALSE
16452|"It is an opinion commonly received, but, like many others, indebted"|FALSE
16452|"for its prevalence to mere want of examination, that a translator"|FALSE
16452|"should imagine to himself the style which his author would probably"|FALSE
16452|"have used, had the language into which he is rendered been his own. A"|FALSE
16452|"direction which wants nothing but practicability to recommend it. For"|FALSE
16452|"suppose six persons, equally qualified for the task, employed to"|FALSE
16452|"translate the same Ancient into their own language, with this rule to"|FALSE
16452|"guide them. In the event it would be found, that each had fallen on a"|FALSE
16452|"manner different from that of all the rest, and by probable inference"|FALSE
16452|"it would follow that none had fallen on the right. On the whole,"|FALSE
16452|"therefore, as has been said, the translation which partakes equally of"|FALSE
16452|"fidelity and liberality, that is close, but not so close as to be"|FALSE
16452|"servile, free, but not so free as to be licentious, promises fairest;"|FALSE
16452|"and my ambition will be sufficiently gratified, if such of my readers"|FALSE
16452|"as are able, and will take the pains to compare me in this respect"|FALSE
16452|"with HOMER, shall judge that I have in any measure attained a point so"|FALSE
16452|"difficult."|FALSE
16452|"As to energy and harmony, two grand requisites in a translation of"|FALSE
16452|"this most energetic and most harmonious of all poets, it is neither my"|FALSE
16452|"purpose nor my wish, should I be found deficient in either, or in"|FALSE
16452|"both, to shelter myself under an unfilial imputation of blame to my"|FALSE
16452|"mother-tongue. Our language is indeed less musical than the Greek, and"|FALSE
16452|"there is no language with which I am at all acquainted that is not."|FALSE
16452|"But it is musical enough for the purposes of melodious verse, and if"|FALSE
16452|"it seem to fail, on whatsoever occasion, in energy, the blame is due,"|FALSE
16452|"not to itself, but to the unskilful manager of it. For so long as"|FALSE
16452|"Milton's works, whether his prose or his verse, shall exist, so long"|FALSE
16452|"there will be abundant proof that no subject, however important,"|FALSE
16452|"however sublime, can demand greater force of expression than is within"|FALSE
16452|"the compass of the English language."|FALSE
16452|"I have no fear of judges familiar with original HOMER. They need not"|FALSE
16452|"be told that a translation of him is an arduous enterprise, and as"|FALSE
16452|"such, entitled to some favor. From these, therefore, I shall expect,"|FALSE
16452|"and shall not be disappointed, considerable candor and allowance."|FALSE
16452|"Especially _they_ will be candid, and I believe that there are many"|FALSE
16452|"such, who have occasionally tried their own strength in this _bow of"|FALSE
16452|"Ulysses_. They have not found it supple and pliable, and with me are"|FALSE
16452|"perhaps ready to acknowledge that they could not always even approach"|FALSE
16452|"with it the mark of their ambition. But I would willingly, were it"|FALSE
16452|"possible, obviate uncandid criticism, because to answer it is lost"|FALSE
16452|"labor, and to receive it in silence has the appearance of stately"|FALSE
16452|"reserve, and self-importance."|FALSE
16452|"To those, therefore, who shall be inclined to tell me hereafter that"|FALSE
16452|"my diction is often plain and unelevated, I reply beforehand that I"|FALSE
16452|"know it,--that it would be absurd were it otherwise, and that Homer"|FALSE
16452|"himself stands in the same predicament. In fact, it is one of his"|FALSE
16452|"numberless excellences, and a point in which his judgment never fails"|FALSE
16452|"him, that he is grand and lofty always in the right place, and knows"|FALSE
16452|"infallibly how to rise and fall with his subject. _Big words on small"|FALSE
16452|"matters_ may serve as a pretty exact definition of the burlesque; an"|FALSE
16452|"instance of which they will find in the Battle of the Frogs and Mice,"|FALSE
16452|"but none in the Iliad."|FALSE
16452|"By others I expect to be told that my numbers, though here and there"|FALSE
16452|"tolerably smooth, are not always such, but have, now and then, an ugly"|FALSE
16452|"hitch in their gait, ungraceful in itself, and inconvenient to the"|FALSE
16452|"reader. To this charge also I plead guilty, but beg leave in"|FALSE
16452|"alleviation of judgment to add, that my limping lines are not"|FALSE
16452|"numerous, compared with those that limp not. The truth is, that not"|FALSE
16452|"one of them all escaped me, but, such as they are, they were all made"|FALSE
16452|"such with a wilful intention. In poems of great length there is no"|FALSE
16452|"blemish more to be feared than sameness of numbers, and every art is"|FALSE
16452|"useful by which it may be avoided. A line, rough in itself, has yet"|FALSE
16452|"its recommendations; it saves the ear the pain of an irksome monotony,"|FALSE
16452|"and seems even to add greater smoothness to others. Milton, whose ear"|FALSE
16452|"and taste were exquisite, has exemplified in his Paradise Lost the"|FALSE
16452|"effect of this practice frequently."|FALSE
16452|"Having mentioned Milton, I cannot but add an observation on the"|FALSE
16452|"similitude of his manner to that of HOMER. It is such, that no person"|FALSE
16452|"familiar with both, can read either without being reminded of the"|FALSE
16452|"other; and it is in those breaks and pauses, to which the numbers of"|FALSE
16452|"the English poet are so much indebted both for their dignity and"|FALSE
16452|"variety, that he chiefly copies the Grecian. But these are graces to"|FALSE
16452|"which rhyme is not competent; so broken, it loses all its music; of"|FALSE
16452|"which any person may convince himself by reading a page only of any of"|FALSE
16452|"our poets anterior to Denham, Waller, and Dryden. A translator of"|FALSE
16452|"HOMER, therefore, seems directed by HOMER himself to the use of blank"|FALSE
16452|"verse, as to that alone in which he can be rendered with any tolerable"|FALSE
16452|"representation of his manner in this particular. A remark which I am"|FALSE
16452|"naturally led to make by a desire to conciliate, if possible, some,"|FALSE
16452|"who, rather unreasonably partial to rhyme, demand it on all occasions,"|FALSE
16452|"and seem persuaded that poetry in our language is a vain attempt"|FALSE
16452|"without it. Verse, that claims to be verse in right of its metre only,"|FALSE
16452|"they judge to be such rather by courtesy than by kind, on an"|FALSE
16452|"apprehension that it costs the writer little trouble, that he has only"|FALSE
16452|"to give his lines their prescribed number of syllables, and so far as"|FALSE
16452|"the mechanical part is concerned, all is well. Were this true, they"|FALSE
16452|"would have reason on their side; for the author is certainly best"|FALSE
16452|"entitled to applause who succeeds against the greatest difficulty, and"|FALSE
16452|"in verse that calls for the most artificial management in its"|FALSE
16452|"construction. But the case is not as they suppose. To rhyme, in our"|FALSE
16452|"language, demands no great exertion of ingenuity, but is always easy"|FALSE
16452|"to a person exercised in the practice. Witness the multitudes who"|FALSE
16452|"rhyme, but have no other poetical pretensions. Let it be considered"|FALSE
16452|"too, how merciful we are apt to be to unclassical and indifferent"|FALSE
16452|"language for the sake of rhyme, and we shall soon see that the labor"|FALSE
16452|"lies principally on the other side. Many ornaments of no easy purchase"|FALSE
16452|"are required to atone for the absence of this single recommendation."|FALSE
16452|"It is not sufficient that the lines of blank verse be smooth in"|FALSE
16452|"themselves, they must also be harmonious in the combination. Whereas"|FALSE
16452|"the chief concern of the rhymist is to beware that his couplets and"|FALSE
16452|"his sense be commensurate, lest the regularity of his numbers should"|FALSE
16452|"be (too frequently at least) interrupted. A trivial difficulty this,"|FALSE
16452|"compared with those which attend the poet unaccompanied by his bells."|FALSE
16452|"He, in order that he may be musical, must exhibit all the variations,"|FALSE
16452|"as he proceeds, of which ten syllables are susceptible; between the"|FALSE
16452|"first syllable and the last there is no place at which he must not"|FALSE
16452|"occasionally pause, and the place of the pause must be perpetually"|FALSE
16452|"shifted. To effect this variety, his attention must be given, at one"|FALSE
16452|"and the same time, to the pauses he has already made in the period"|FALSE
16452|"before him, as well as to that which he is about to make, and to those"|FALSE
16452|"which shall succeed it. On no lighter terms than these is it possible"|FALSE
16452|"that blank verse can be written which will not, in the course of a"|FALSE
16452|"long work, fatigue the ear past all endurance. If it be easier,"|FALSE
16452|"therefore, to throw five balls into the air and to catch them in"|FALSE
16452|"succession, than to sport in that manner with one only, then may blank"|FALSE
16452|"verse be more easily fabricated than rhyme. And if to these labors we"|FALSE
16452|"add others equally requisite, a style in general more elaborate than"|FALSE
16452|"rhyme requires, farther removed from the vernacular idiom both in the"|FALSE
16452|"language itself and in the arrangement of it, we shall not long doubt"|FALSE
16452|"which of these two very different species of verse threatens the"|FALSE
16452|"composer with most expense of study and contrivance. I feel it"|FALSE
16452|"unpleasant to appeal to my own experience, but, having no other"|FALSE
16452|"voucher at hand, am constrained to it. As I affirm, so I have found. I"|FALSE
16452|"have dealt pretty largely in both kinds, and have frequently written"|FALSE
16452|"more verses in a day, with tags, than I could ever write without them."|FALSE
16452|"To what has been here said (which whether it have been said by others"|FALSE
16452|"or not, I cannot tell, having never read any modern book on the"|FALSE
16452|"subject) I shall only add, that to be poetical without rhyme, is an"|FALSE
16452|"argument of a sound and classical constitution in any language."|FALSE
16452|"A word or two on the subject of the following translation, and I have"|FALSE
16452|"done."|FALSE
16452|"My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to my original,"|FALSE
16452|"convinced that every departure from him would be punished with the"|FALSE
16452|"forfeiture of some grace or beauty for which I could substitute no"|FALSE
16452|"equivalent. The epithets that would consent to an English form I have"|FALSE
16452|"preserved as epithets; others that would not, I have melted into the"|FALSE
16452|"context. There are none, I believe, which I have not translated in one"|FALSE
16452|"way or other, though the reader will not find them repeated so often"|FALSE
16452|"as most of them are in HOMER, for a reason that need not be mentioned."|FALSE
16452|"Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the Iliad or"|FALSE
16452|"Odyssey by their own name only, but their patronymic is given also. To"|FALSE
16452|"this ceremonial I have generally attended, because it is a"|FALSE
16452|"circumstance of my author's manner."|FALSE
16452|"HOMER never allots less than a whole line to the introduction of a"|FALSE
16452|"speaker. No, not even when the speech itself is no longer than the"|FALSE
16452|"line that leads it. A practice to which, since he never departs from"|FALSE
16452|"it, he must have been determined by some cogent reason. He probably"|FALSE
16452|"deemed it a formality necessary to the majesty of his narration. In"|FALSE
16452|"this article, therefore, I have scrupulously adhered to my pattern,"|FALSE
16452|"considering these introductory lines as heralds in a procession;"|FALSE
16452|"important persons, because employed to usher in persons more important"|FALSE
16452|"than themselves."|FALSE
16452|"It has been my point every where to be as little verbose as possible,"|FALSE
16452|"though; at the same time, my constant determination not to sacrifice"|FALSE
16452|"my author's full meaning to an affected brevity."|FALSE
16452|"In the affair of style, I have endeavored neither to creep nor to"|FALSE
16452|"bluster, for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both"|FALSE
16452|"these faults, as HOMER, though himself never guilty of either. I have"|FALSE
16452|"cautiously avoided all terms of new invention, with an abundance of"|FALSE
16452|"which, persons of more ingenuity than judgment have not enriched our"|FALSE
16452|"language, but incumbered it. I have also every where used an"|FALSE

16452|"The passages which will be least noticed, and possibly not at all,"|FALSE

16452|"sheep with dignity in a modern language, to flay and to prepare it for"|FALSE
16452|"the table, detailing every circumstance of the process. Difficult"|FALSE
16452|"also, without sinking below the level of poetry, to harness mules to a"|FALSE
16452|"wagon, particularizing every article of their furniture, straps,"|FALSE
16452|"rings, staples, and even the tying of the knots that kept all"|FALSE
16452|"together. HOMER, who writes always to the eye, with all his sublimity"|FALSE
16452|"and grandeur, has the minuteness of a Flemish painter."|FALSE
16452|"But in what degree I have succeeded in my version either of these"|FALSE
16452|"passages, and such as these, or of others more buoyant and"|FALSE

16452|"I purposely decline all declamation on the merits of HOMER, because a"|FALSE

16452|"that his works have ever reached, even deified by the greatest names"|FALSE
16452|"of antiquity, and in some places actually worshipped. And to say"|FALSE
16452|"truth, were it possible that mere man could entitle himself by"|FALSE
16452|"pre-eminence of any kind to divine honors, Homer's astonishing powers"|FALSE
16452|"seem to have given him the best pretensions."|FALSE

16452|"Unknown as he was to me when I entered on this arduous undertaking"|FALSE
16452|"(indeed to this moment I have never seen him) he yet voluntarily and"|FALSE
16452|"generously offered himself as my revisor. To his classical taste and"|FALSE
16452|"just discernment I have been indebted for the discovery of many"|FALSE
16452|"blemishes in my own work, and of beauties, which would otherwise have"|FALSE
16452|"escaped me, in the original. But his necessary avocations would not"|FALSE
16452|"suffer him to accompany me farther than to the latter books of the"|FALSE
16452|"Iliad, a circumstance which I fear my readers, as well as myself, will"|FALSE
16452|"regret with too much reason.[1]"|FALSE
16452|"I have obligations likewise to many friends, whose names, were it"|FALSE
16452|"proper to mention them here, would do me great honor. They have"|FALSE
16452|"encouraged me by their approbation, have assisted me with valuable"|FALSE
16452|"books, and have eased me of almost the whole labor of transcribing."|FALSE
16452|"And now I have only to regret that my pleasant work is ended. To the"|FALSE
16452|"illustrious Greek I owe the smooth and easy flight of many thousand"|FALSE
16452|"hours. He has been my companion at home and abroad, in the study, in"|FALSE
16452|"the garden, and in the field; and no measure of success, let my labors"|FALSE
16452|"succeed as they may, will ever compensate to me the loss of the"|FALSE

16452|"                           SECOND EDITION."|FALSE
16452|"Soon after my publication of this work, I began to prepare it for a"|FALSE
16452|"second edition, by an accurate revisal of the first. It seemed to me,"|FALSE
16452|"that here and there, perhaps a slight alteration might satisfy the"|FALSE
16452|"demands of some, whom I was desirous to please; and I comforted myself"|FALSE
16452|"with the reflection, that if I still failed to conciliate all, I"|FALSE
16452|"should yet have no cause to account myself in a singular degree"|FALSE
16452|"unfortunate. To please an unqualified judge, an author must sacrifice"|FALSE
16452|"too much; and the attempt to please an uncandid one were altogether"|FALSE
16452|"hopeless. In one or other of these classes may be ranged all such"|FALSE
16452|"objectors, as would deprive blank verse of one of its principal"|FALSE
16452|"advantages, the variety of its pauses; together with all such as deny"|FALSE
16452|"the good effect, on the whole, of a line, now and then, less"|FALSE
16452|"harmonious than its fellows."|FALSE
16452|"With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an unaccountable"|FALSE
16452|"rashness, that HOMER himself has given me an example of verse without"|FALSE
16452|"them. Had this been true, it would by no means have concluded against"|FALSE
16452|"the use of them in an English version of HOMER; because, in one"|FALSE
16452|"language, and in one species of metre, that may be musical, which in"|FALSE
16452|"another would be found disgusting. But the assertion is totally"|FALSE
16452|"unfounded. The pauses in Homer's verse are so frequent and various,"|FALSE
16452|"that to name another poet, if pauses are a fault, more faulty than he,"|FALSE
16452|"were, perhaps, impossible. It may even be questioned, if a single"|FALSE
16452|"passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be"|FALSE
16452|"singled out from all the thousands that he has left us. He frequently"|FALSE
16452|"pauses at the first word of the line, when it consists of three or"|FALSE
16452|"more syllables; not seldom when of two; and sometimes even when of one"|FALSE
16452|"only. In this practice he was followed, as was observed in my Preface"|FALSE
16452|"to the first edition, by the Author of the Paradise Lost. An example"|FALSE
16452|"inimitable indeed, but which no writer of English heroic verse without"|FALSE
16452|"rhyme can neglect with impunity."|FALSE
16452|"Similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the"|FALSE
16452|"occasional use of a line irregularly constructed. When Horace censured"|FALSE
16452|"Lucilius for his lines _incomposite pede currentes_, he did not mean"|FALSE
16452|"to say, that he was chargeable with such in some instances, or even in"|FALSE
16452|"many, for then the censure would have been equally applicable to"|FALSE
16452|"himself; but he designed by that expression to characterize all his"|FALSE
16452|"writings. The censure therefore was just; Lucilius wrote at a time"|FALSE
16452|"when the Roman verse had not yet received its polish, and instead of"|FALSE
16452|"introducing artfully his rugged lines, and to serve a particular"|FALSE
16452|"purpose, had probably seldom, and never but by accident, composed a"|FALSE
16452|"smooth one. Such has been the versification of the earliest poets in"|FALSE
16452|"every country. Children lisp, at first, and stammer; but, in time,"|FALSE
16452|"their speech becomes fluent, and, if they are well taught, harmonious."|FALSE
16452|"HOMER himself is not invariably regular in the construction of his"|FALSE
16452|"verse. Had he been so, Eustathius, an excellent critic and warm"|FALSE
16452|"admirer of HOMER, had never affirmed, that some of his lines want a"|FALSE
16452|"head, some a tail, and others a middle. Some begin with a word that is"|FALSE
16452|"neither dactyl nor spondee, some conclude with a dactyl, and in the"|FALSE
16452|"intermediate part he sometimes deviates equally from the established"|FALSE
16452|"custom. I confess that instances of this sort are rare; but they are"|FALSE
16452|"surely, though few, sufficient to warrant a sparing use of similar"|FALSE
16452|"license in the present day."|FALSE
16452|"Unwilling, however, to seem obstinate in both these particulars, I"|FALSE
16452|"conformed myself in some measure to these objections, though"|FALSE
16452|"unconvinced myself of their propriety. Several of the rudest and most"|FALSE
16452|"unshapely lines I composed anew; and several of the pauses least in"|FALSE
16452|"use I displaced for the sake of an easier enunciation.--And this was"|FALSE
16452|"the state of the work after the revisal given it about seven years"|FALSE
16452|"since."|FALSE
16452|"Between that revisal and the present a considerable time intervened,"|FALSE
16452|"and the effect of long discontinuance was, that I became more"|FALSE
16452|"dissatisfied with it myself, than the most difficult to be pleased of"|FALSE
16452|"all my judges. Not for the sake of a few uneven lines or unwonted"|FALSE
16452|"pauses, but for reasons far more substantial. The diction seemed to me"|FALSE
16452|"in many passages either not sufficiently elevated, or deficient in the"|FALSE
16452|"grace of ease, and in others I found the sense of the original either"|FALSE
16452|"not adequately expressed or misapprehended. Many elisions still"|FALSE
16452|"remained unsoftened; the compound epithets I found not always happily"|FALSE
16452|"combined, and the same sometimes too frequently repeated."|FALSE
16452|"There is no end of passages in HOMER, which must creep unless they are"|FALSE
16452|"lifted; yet in such, all embellishment is out of the question. The"|FALSE
16452|"hero puts on his clothes, or refreshes himself with food and wine, or"|FALSE
16452|"he yokes his steed, takes a journey, and in the evening preparation is"|FALSE
16452|"made for his repose. To give relief to subjects prosaic as these"|FALSE
16452|"without seeming unreasonably tumid is extremely difficult. Mr. Pope"|FALSE
16452|"much abridges some of them, and others he omits; but neither of these"|FALSE
16452|"liberties was compatible with the nature of my undertaking. These,"|FALSE
16452|"therefore, and many similar to these, have been new-modeled; somewhat"|FALSE
16452|"to their advantage I hope, but not even now entirely to my"|FALSE
16452|"satisfaction. The lines have a more natural movement, the pauses are"|FALSE
16452|"fewer and less stately, the expression as easy as I could make it"|FALSE
16452|"without meanness, and these were all the improvements that I could"|FALSE
16452|"give them."|FALSE
16452|"The elisions, I believe, are all cured, with only one exception. An"|FALSE
16452|"alternative proposes itself to a modern versifier, from which there is"|FALSE
16452|"no escape, which occurs perpetually, and which, choose as he may,"|FALSE
16452|"presents him always with an evil. I mean in the instance of the"|FALSE
16452|"particle (_the_). When this particle precedes a vowel, shall he melt"|FALSE
16452|"it into the substantive, or leave the _hiatus_ open? Both practices"|FALSE
16452|"are offensive to a delicate ear. The particle absorbed occasions"|FALSE
16452|"harshness, and the open vowel a vacuity equally inconvenient."|FALSE
16452|"Sometimes, therefore, to leave it open, and sometimes to ingraft it"|FALSE
16452|"into its adjunct seems most advisable; this course Mr. Pope has taken,"|FALSE
16452|"whose authority recommended it to me; though of the two evils I have"|FALSE
16452|"most frequently chosen the elision as the least."|FALSE
16452|"Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of"|FALSE
16452|"our country, that I employed them without fear or scruple. To have"|FALSE
16452|"abstained from them in a blank verse translation of Homer, who abounds"|FALSE
16452|"with them, and from whom our poets probably first adopted them, would"|FALSE
16452|"have been strange indeed. But though the genius of our language favors"|FALSE
16452|"the formation of such words almost as much as that of the Greek, it"|FALSE
16452|"happens sometimes, that a Grecian compound either cannot be rendered"|FALSE
16452|"in English at all, or, at best, but awkwardly. For this reason, and"|FALSE
16452|"because I found that some readers much disliked them, I have expunged"|FALSE
16452|"many; retaining, according to my best judgment, the most eligible"|FALSE
16452|"only, and making less frequent the repetitions even of these."|FALSE
16452|"I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of this"|FALSE
16452|"last revisal, unless it be proper to give the reason why the Iliad,"|FALSE
16452|"though greatly altered, has undergone much fewer alterations than the"|FALSE
16452|"Odyssey. The true reason I believe is this. The Iliad demanded my"|FALSE
16452|"utmost possible exertions; it seemed to meet me like an ascent almost"|FALSE
16452|"perpendicular, which could not be surmounted at less cost than of all"|FALSE
16452|"the labor that I could bestow on it. The Odyssey on the contrary"|FALSE
16452|"seemed to resemble an open and level country, through which I might"|FALSE
16452|"travel at my ease. The latter, therefore, betrayed me into some"|FALSE
16452|"negligence, which, though little conscious of it at the time, on an"|FALSE
16452|"accurate search, I found had left many disagreeable effects behind it."|FALSE
16452|"I now leave the work to its fate. Another may labor hereafter in an"|FALSE
16452|"attempt of the same kind with more success; but more industriously, I"|FALSE
16452|"believe, none ever will."|FALSE

16452|"I had, however, a pleasing though a melancholy opportunity of tracing"|FALSE

16452|"He had written these lines with a pencil, on a leaf at the end of his"|FALSE
16452|"Iliad; and when I reflected on the cause which had given them birth, I"|FALSE
16452|"could not but admire its disproportion to the effect. What the voice"|FALSE
16452|"of persuasion had failed in for a year, accident had silently"|FALSE
16452|"accomplished in a single day. The circumstance I allude to was this: I"|FALSE
16452|"received a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey of Pope, then recently"|FALSE
16452|"published by the Editor above mentioned, with illustrative and"|FALSE
16452|"critical notes of his own. As it commended Mr. Cowper's Translation in"|FALSE
16452|"the Preface, and occasionally pointed out its merits in the Notes, I"|FALSE
16452|"was careful to place it in his way; though it was more from a habit of"|FALSE
16452|"experiment which I had contracted, than from well-grounded hopes of"|FALSE
16452|"success. But what a fortunate circumstance was the arrival of this"|FALSE
16452|"Work! and by what name worthy of its influence shall I call it? In the"|FALSE
16452|"mouth of an indifferent person it might be Chance; but in mine; whom"|FALSE
16452|"it rendered so peculiarly happy, common gratitude requires that it"|FALSE
16452|"should be Providence."|FALSE
16452|"As I watched him with an indescribable interest in his progress, I had"|FALSE
16452|"the satisfaction to find, that, after a few mornings given to"|FALSE
16452|"promiscuous correction, and to frequent perusal of the above-mentioned"|FALSE
16452|"Notes, he was evidently settling on the sixteenth Book. This he went"|FALSE
16452|"regularly through, and the fruits of an application so happily resumed"|FALSE
16452|"were, one day with another, about sixty new lines. But with the end of"|FALSE
16452|"the sixteenth Book he had closed the corrections of the year. An"|FALSE
16452|"excursion to the coast, which immediately followed, though it promised"|FALSE
16452|"an accession of strength to the body, could not fail to interfere with"|FALSE
16452|"the pursuits of the mind. It was therefore with much less surprise"|FALSE
16452|"than regret, that I saw him relinquish the \"_Tale of Troy Divine_.\""|FALSE
16452|"Such was the prelude to the last revisal, which, in the month of"|FALSE
16452|"January, ninety-seven, Mr. Cowper was persuaded to undertake; and to a"|FALSE
16452|"faithful copy, as I trust, of which, I have at this time the honor to"|FALSE
16452|"conduct the reader. But it may not be amiss to observe, that with"|FALSE
16452|"regard to the earlier books of the Iliad, it was less a revisal of the"|FALSE
16452|"altered text, than of the text as it stands in the first edition. For"|FALSE
16452|"though the interleaved copy was always at hand, and in the multitude"|FALSE
16452|"of its altered places could hardly fail to offer some things worthy to"|FALSE
16452|"be preserved, but which the ravages of illness and the lapse of time"|FALSE
16452|"might have utterly effaced from his mind, I could not often persuade"|FALSE
16452|"the Translator to consult it. I was therefore induced, in the course"|FALSE
16452|"of transcribing, to compare the two revisals as I went along, and to"|FALSE
16452|"plead for the continuance of the first correction, when it forcibly"|FALSE
16452|"struck me as better than the last. This, however, but seldom occurred;"|FALSE
16452|"and the practice, at length, was completely left off, by his"|FALSE
16452|"consenting to receive into the number of the books which were daily"|FALSE
16452|"laid open before him, the interleaved copy to which I allude."|FALSE
16452|"At the end of the first six books of the Iliad, the arrival of spring"|FALSE
16452|"brought the usual interruptions of exercise and air, which increased"|FALSE
16452|"as the summer advanced to a degree so unfavorable to the progress of"|FALSE
16452|"HOMER, that in the requisite attention to their salutary claims, the"|FALSE
16452|"revisal was, at one time, altogether at a stand. Only four books were"|FALSE
16452|"added in the course of nine months; but opportunity returning as the"|FALSE
16452|"winter set in, there were added, in less than seven weeks, four more:"|FALSE
16452|"and thus ended the year ninety-seven."|FALSE
16452|"As the spring that succeeded was a happier spring, so it led to a"|FALSE
16452|"happier summer. We had no longer air and exercise alone, but exercise"|FALSE
16452|"and Homer hand in hand. He even followed us thrice to the sea: and"|FALSE
16452|"whether our walks were"|FALSE
16452|"                    \"on the margin of the land,"|FALSE
16452|"  O'er the green summit of the\" cliffs, \"whose base"|FALSE
16452|"  Beats back the roaring surge,\""|FALSE
16452|"                        \"or on the shore"|FALSE
16452|"  Of the untillable and barren deep,\""|FALSE
16452|"they were always within hearing of his magic song. About the middle of"|FALSE
16452|"this busy summer, the revisal of the Iliad was brought to a close; and"|FALSE

16452|"1. \"Latona's son and Jove's,\" was Apollo, the tutelary deity of the"|FALSE
16452|"   Dorians. The Dorians had not, however, at this early age, become"|FALSE
16452|"   the predominant race in Greece proper. They had spread along the"|FALSE
16452|"   eastern shores of the Archipelago into the islands, especially"|FALSE
16452|"   Crete, and had every where signalized themselves by the Temples of"|FALSE
16452|"   Apollo, of which there seems to have been many in and about Troy."|FALSE
16452|"   These temples were schools of art, and prove the Dorians to have"|FALSE
16452|"   been both intellectual and powerful. Homer was an Ionian, and"|FALSE
16452|"   therefore not deeply acquainted with the nature of the Dorian god."|FALSE
16452|"   But to a mind like his, the god of a people so cultivated, and"|FALSE
16452|"   associated with what was most grand in art, must have been an"|FALSE
16452|"   imposing being, and we find him so represented. Throughout the"|FALSE
16452|"   Iliad, he appears and acts with splendor and effect, but always"|FALSE
16452|"   against the Greeks from mere partiality to Hector. It would perhaps"|FALSE
16452|"   be too much to say, that in this partiality to Hector, we detect"|FALSE
16452|"   the spirit of the Dorian worship, the only Paganism of antiquity"|FALSE
16452|"   that tended to perfect the individual--Apollo being the expression"|FALSE
16452|"   of the moral harmony of the universe, and the great spirit of the"|FALSE
16452|"   Dorian culture being to make a perfect man, an incarnation of the"|FALSE
16452|"   {kosmos}. This Homer could only have known intuitively."|FALSE
16452|"   In making Apollo author of the plague, he was confounded with"|FALSE
16452|"   Helios, which was frequent afterwards, but is not seen elsewhere in"|FALSE
16452|"   Homer. The arrows of Apollo were \"silent as light,\" and their"|FALSE
16452|"   emblem the sun's rays. The analogies are multitudinous between the"|FALSE
16452|"   natural and intellectual sun; but Helios and Apollo were"|FALSE
16452|"   two.--E.P.P."|FALSE
16452|"2. There is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the"|FALSE
16452|"   priest. He comes with the ensigns of the gods to whom he belongs,"|FALSE
16452|"   with the laurel wreath, to show that he was a suppliant, and a"|FALSE
16452|"   golden sceptre, which the ancients gave in particular to Apollo, as"|FALSE
16452|"   they did one of silver to Diana."|FALSE
16452|"3. The art of this speech is remarkable. Chryses considers the army of"|FALSE
16452|"   Greeks, as made up of troops, partly from the kingdoms and partly"|FALSE
16452|"   from democracies, and therefore begins with a distinction that"|FALSE
16452|"   includes all. Then, as priest of Apollo, he prays that they may"|FALSE
16452|"   obtain the two blessings they most desire--the conquest of Troy and"|FALSE
16452|"   a safe return. As he names his petition, he offers an extraordinary"|FALSE
16452|"   ransom, and concludes with bidding them fear the god if they refuse"|FALSE
16452|"   it; like one who from his office seems to foretell their misery,"|FALSE
16452|"   and exhorts them to shun it. Thus he endeavors to work by the art"|FALSE
16452|"   of a general application, by religion, by interest, and the"|FALSE
16452|"   insinuation of danger."|FALSE
16452|"4. Homer is frequently eloquent in his silence. Chryses says not a"|FALSE
16452|"   word in answer to the insults of Agamemnon, but walks pensively"|FALSE
16452|"   along the shore. The melancholy flowing of the verse admirably"|FALSE
16452|"   expresses the condition of the mournful and deserted father."|FALSE
16452|"5. [So called on account of his having saved the people of Troas from"|FALSE

16452|"6. Apollo had temples at Chrysa, Tenedos, and Cilla, all of which lay"|FALSE
16452|"   round the bay of Troas. Müller remarks, that \"the temple actually"|FALSE

16452|"   Smintheus was still preserved in the district. Thus far actual"|FALSE

16452|"   action of the deity as such, is purely ideal, and can have no other"|FALSE

16452|"   sending plagues. This belief is in perfect harmony with the idea"|FALSE
16452|"   generally entertained of the power and agency of Apollo; and it is"|FALSE
16452|"   manifest that the idea placed in combination with certain events,"|FALSE
16452|"   gave birth to the story so far as relates to the god. We have not"|FALSE
16452|"   yet the means of ascertaining whether it is to be regarded as a"|FALSE

16452|"   the scene with a beautiful allegory. He supposes that such"|FALSE
16452|"   afflictions are sent from Heaven for the punishment of evil"|FALSE
16452|"   actions; and because the sun was the principal agent, he says it"|FALSE
16452|"   was sent to punish Agamemnon for despising that god, and injuring"|FALSE
16452|"   his priest."|FALSE
16452|"10. Hippocrates observes two things of plagues; that their cause is in"|FALSE
16452|"   the air, and that different animals are differently affected by"|FALSE
16452|"   them, according to their nature and nourishment. This philosophy is"|FALSE
16452|"   referred to the plagues here mentioned. First, the cause is in the"|FALSE
16452|"   air by means of the darts or beams of Apollo; second, the mules and"|FALSE
16452|"   dogs are said to die sooner than the men, partly from their natural"|FALSE
16452|"   quickness of smell, and partly from their feeding so near the earth"|FALSE
16452|"   whence the exhalations arise."|FALSE
16452|"11: Juno, queen of Olympus, sides with the Grecians. Mr. Coleridge (in"|FALSE

16452|"   the Grecian religion, expressed the spirit of conservatism. Without"|FALSE
16452|"   going over his argument we assume it here, for Homer always"|FALSE
16452|"   attributes to Juno every thing that may be predicated of this"|FALSE
16452|"   principle. She is persistent, obstinate, acts from no idea, but"|FALSE
16452|"   often uses a superficial reasoning, and refers to Fate, with which"|FALSE

16452|"   anxious to preserve in point of honor, and as a testimony of his"|FALSE
16452|"   glory. Hence he mentions her only as \"his spoil,\" \"the reward of"|FALSE

16452|"   restraining his wrath through his consideration of martial law and"|FALSE
16452|"   order. This law in that age, prescribed that a subordinate should"|FALSE
16452|"   not draw his sword upon the commander of all, but allowed a liberty"|FALSE

16452|"22. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was"|FALSE
16452|"   nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of"|FALSE
16452|"   sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on"|FALSE

16452|"   From the description here given, it would appear to have been a"|FALSE

16452|"26. The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of"|FALSE
16452|"   Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes"|FALSE
16452|"   to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone"|FALSE
16452|"   conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed"|FALSE
16452|"   with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids. The deepest"|FALSE
16452|"   anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his"|FALSE
16452|"   insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the"|FALSE
16452|"   spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a"|FALSE
16452|"   divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the"|FALSE
16452|"   Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by"|FALSE
16452|"   calling up the giant Briareus or Ægæon to his rescue. Why it was"|FALSE
16452|"   Ægæon, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon,"|FALSE
16452|"   who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even"|FALSE
16452|"   the sea-god himself was called Ægæon; who, moreover, was worshipped"|FALSE
16452|"   at several places in Euboea, the seat of Poseidon Ægæus; and whom"|FALSE
16452|"   the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the"|FALSE
16452|"   genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into"|FALSE
16452|"   relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found"|FALSE
16452|"   in ancient belief, why Thetis called up Ægæon of all others to"|FALSE
16452|"   Jove's assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not"|FALSE
16452|"   detailed--it is not much more than indicated--and therefore it"|FALSE
16452|"   would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly"|FALSE

16452|"11. Though this comparison may be justly admired for its beauty in the"|FALSE
