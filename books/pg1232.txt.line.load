1|"THE PRINCE"|FALSE
1|"by Nicolo Machiavelli"|FALSE
1|"Translated by W. K. Marriott"|FALSE
1|"Nicolo Machiavelli, born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. From 1494 to 1512"|FALSE
1|"held an official post at Florence which included diplomatic missions to"|FALSE
1|"various European courts. Imprisoned in Florence, 1512; later exiled and"|FALSE
1|"returned to San Casciano. Died at Florence on 22nd June 1527."|FALSE
1|"INTRODUCTION"|FALSE
1|"Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the"|FALSE
1|"second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,"|FALSE
1|"and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members"|FALSE
1|"of the old Florentine nobility."|FALSE
1|"His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly"|FALSE
1|"enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of"|FALSE
1|"Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an"|FALSE
1|"Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de' Medici, Il Magnifico."|FALSE
1|"The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year"|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career"|FALSE
1|"Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted"|FALSE
1|"until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his"|FALSE
1|"office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they"|FALSE
1|"were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli's literary"|FALSE
1|"activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of"|FALSE
1|"the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth"|FALSE
1|"year, without having regained office."|FALSE
1|"YOUTH -- Aet. 1-25--1469-94"|FALSE
1|"Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the"|FALSE
1|"Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of"|FALSE
1|"this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been"|FALSE
1|"described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by"|FALSE
1|"the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving"|FALSE
1|"Lorenzo. Savonarola's influence upon the young Machiavelli must have"|FALSE
1|"been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the"|FALSE
1|"fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of"|FALSE
1|"a gibe in \"The Prince,\" where he is cited as an example of an unarmed"|FALSE
1|"prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean"|FALSE
1|"rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli"|FALSE
1|"strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to"|FALSE
1|"Lorenzo's grandson that he dedicates \"The Prince.\""|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli, in his \"History of Florence,\" gives us a picture of the"|FALSE
1|"young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: \"They were freer"|FALSE
1|"than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other"|FALSE
1|"kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,"|FALSE
1|"and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with"|FALSE
1|"wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly"|FALSE
1|"was thought the wisest.\" In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows"|FALSE
1|"why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads"|FALSE
1|"us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: \"I"|FALSE
1|"have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,"|FALSE
1|"especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than"|FALSE
1|"which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and"|FALSE
1|"to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your"|FALSE
1|"share.\" Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: \"This will turn"|FALSE
1|"out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you"|FALSE
1|"have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and"|FALSE
1|"music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I"|FALSE
1|"have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success"|FALSE
1|"and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you"|FALSE
1|"if you help yourself.\""|FALSE
1|"OFFICE -- Aet. 25-43--1494-1512"|FALSE
1|"The second period of Machiavelli's life was spent in the service of the"|FALSE
1|"free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from"|FALSE
1|"the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After"|FALSE
1|"serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed"|FALSE
1|"Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty"|FALSE
1|"and Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of"|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli's life, for during this time he took a leading part in"|FALSE
1|"the affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records,"|FALSE
1|"and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere"|FALSE
1|"recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and"|FALSE
1|"soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and"|FALSE
1|"supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters"|FALSE
1|"which illustrate \"The Prince.\""|FALSE
1|"His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \"my lady of Forli\" of"|FALSE
1|"\"The Prince,\" from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it"|FALSE
1|"is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on"|FALSE
1|"fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is"|FALSE
1|"urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes."|FALSE
1|"In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for"|FALSE
1|"continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct"|FALSE
1|"of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft"|FALSE
1|"summarized in \"The Prince,\" and was consequently driven out. He, also,"|FALSE
1|"it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support"|FALSE
1|"to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge"|FALSE
1|"that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the"|FALSE
1|"faith of princes."|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli's public life was largely occupied with events arising out"|FALSE
1|"of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the"|FALSE
1|"Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of \"The Prince.\""|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the"|FALSE
1|"benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he"|FALSE
1|"can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare"|FALSE
1|"Borgia's conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as"|FALSE
1|"the \"hero\" of \"The Prince.\" Yet in \"The Prince\" the duke is in point of"|FALSE
1|"fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and"|FALSE
1|"falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a"|FALSE
1|"prudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all"|FALSE
1|"eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities"|FALSE
1|"fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an"|FALSE
1|"extraordinary and unforeseen fatality."|FALSE
1|"On the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch"|FALSE
1|"the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated"|FALSE
1|"into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere"|FALSE
1|"(Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear"|FALSE
1|"the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that"|FALSE
1|"he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old"|FALSE
1|"injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined"|FALSE
1|"Cesare."|FALSE
1|"It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff"|FALSE
1|"was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a"|FALSE
1|"successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly"|FALSE
1|"to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius that"|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and"|FALSE
1|"concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win"|FALSE
1|"and hold them both."|FALSE
1|"It is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian"|FALSE
1|"states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,"|FALSE
1|"with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those"|FALSE
1|"events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they"|FALSE
1|"impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with"|FALSE
1|"Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch's character has"|FALSE
1|"already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as"|FALSE
1|"the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but"|FALSE
1|"who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,"|FALSE
1|"had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been"|FALSE
1|"ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men"|FALSE
1|"of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but"|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret"|FALSE
1|"of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without"|FALSE
1|"force of character--ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry"|FALSE
1|"his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of his"|FALSE
1|"wishes."|FALSE
1|"The remaining years of Machiavelli's official career were filled with"|FALSE
1|"events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the"|FALSE
1|"three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the"|FALSE
1|"object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in"|FALSE
1|"the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in"|FALSE
1|"eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during these"|FALSE
1|"events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between"|FALSE
1|"the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the"|FALSE
1|"entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed"|FALSE
1|"the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss"|FALSE
1|"drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope,"|FALSE
1|"and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should"|FALSE
1|"be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September"|FALSE
1|"1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the"|FALSE
1|"dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his"|FALSE
1|"public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office."|FALSE
1|"LITERATURE AND DEATH -- Aet. 43-58--1512-27"|FALSE
1|"On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had"|FALSE
1|"vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was"|FALSE
1|"dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he was"|FALSE
1|"accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,"|FALSE
1|"imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,"|FALSE
1|"Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San"|FALSE
1|"Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In a"|FALSE
1|"letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left"|FALSE
1|"a very interesting description of his life at this period, which"|FALSE
1|"elucidates his methods and his motives in writing \"The Prince.\" After"|FALSE
1|"describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he"|FALSE
1|"writes: \"The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at"|FALSE
1|"the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,"|FALSE
1|"and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I"|FALSE
1|"pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly"|FALSE
1|"received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I"|FALSE
1|"do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their"|FALSE
1|"actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I"|FALSE
1|"feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,"|FALSE
1|"death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men."|FALSE
1|"And because Dante says:"|FALSE
1|"     Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,"|FALSE
1|"     Unfruitful else,"|FALSE
1|"I have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have"|FALSE
1|"composed a small work on 'Principalities,' where I pour myself out"|FALSE
1|"as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a"|FALSE
1|"principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how"|FALSE
1|"they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever"|FALSE
1|"pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,"|FALSE
1|"especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it"|FALSE
1|"to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will"|FALSE
1|"be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with"|FALSE
1|"him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\""|FALSE
1|"The \"little book\" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form"|FALSE
1|"in which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work"|FALSE
1|"during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some"|FALSE
1|"unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici. Although"|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or"|FALSE
1|"presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo"|FALSE
1|"ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any"|FALSE
1|"employment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli's lifetime,"|FALSE
1|"\"The Prince\" was never published by him, and its text is still"|FALSE
1|"disputable."|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \"And as to this little"|FALSE
1|"thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during the"|FALSE
1|"fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neither"|FALSE
1|"slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one who"|FALSE
1|"has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my loyalty none"|FALSE
1|"could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn how"|FALSE
1|"to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot"|FALSE
1|"change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty.\""|FALSE
1|"Before Machiavelli had got \"The Prince\" off his hands he commenced his"|FALSE
1|"\"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,\" which should be read"|FALSE
1|"concurrently with \"The Prince.\" These and several minor works occupied"|FALSE
1|"him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look"|FALSE
1|"after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the"|FALSE
1|"Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to"|FALSE
1|"her citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new"|FALSE
1|"constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on"|FALSE
1|"one pretext or another it was not promulgated."|FALSE
1|"In 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli"|FALSE
1|"to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly"|FALSE
1|"remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he"|FALSE
1|"was much sought after, and also for the production of his \"Art of War.\""|FALSE
1|"It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance"|FALSE
1|"of Cardinal de' Medici to write the \"History of Florence,\" a task"|FALSE
1|"which occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have"|FALSE
1|"determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer"|FALSE
1|"observes that \"an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will"|FALSE
1|"endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play"|FALSE
1|"with.\""|FALSE
1|"When the \"History of Florence\" was finished, Machiavelli took it to"|FALSE
1|"Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de' Medici, who had in"|FALSE
1|"the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhat"|FALSE
1|"remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written \"The Prince\" for"|FALSE
1|"the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power in"|FALSE
1|"Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \"History of Florence\" to the"|FALSE
1|"head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year the"|FALSE
1|"battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I"|FALSE
1|"a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed"|FALSE
1|"by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at"|FALSE
1|"Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished."|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his"|FALSE
1|"return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \"Ten of"|FALSE
1|"Liberty and Peace.\" Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached"|FALSE
1|"Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527."|FALSE
1|"THE MAN AND HIS WORKS"|FALSE
1|"No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence"|FALSE
1|"has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her"|FALSE
1|"most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have"|FALSE
1|"found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the"|FALSE
1|"germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle"|FALSE
1|"to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,"|FALSE
1|"it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which"|FALSE
1|"this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that"|FALSE
1|"the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more"|FALSE
1|"reasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \"unholy"|FALSE
1|"necromancer,\" which so long haunted men's vision, has begun to fade."|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and"|FALSE
1|"industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and"|FALSE
1|"with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced"|FALSE
1|"retirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he"|FALSE
1|"depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination,"|FALSE
1|"the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been"|FALSE
1|"only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political"|FALSE
1|"employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,"|FALSE
1|"overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren of"|FALSE
1|"results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that"|FALSE
1|"he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of his"|FALSE
1|"own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the"|FALSE
1|"side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising"|FALSE
1|"himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, and"|FALSE
1|"Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to"|FALSE
1|"write the \"History of Florence,\" rather than employ him in the state."|FALSE
1|"And it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, that"|FALSE
1|"we find no weakness and no failure."|FALSE
1|"Although the light of almost four centuries has been focused on \"The"|FALSE
1|"Prince,\" its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they"|FALSE
1|"are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as"|FALSE
1|"they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli's contemporaries; yet they"|FALSE
1|"cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe"|FALSE
1|"rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical incidents"|FALSE
1|"and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which"|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and"|FALSE
1|"conduct."|FALSE
1|"Leaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish"|FALSE
1|"some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, \"The"|FALSE
1|"Prince\" is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men"|FALSE
1|"are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the"|FALSE
1|"days of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices"|FALSE
1|"which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon."|FALSE
1|"Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them"|FALSE
1|"to be--and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;"|FALSE
1|"prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then--to pass to"|FALSE
1|"a higher plane--Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win"|FALSE
1|"an empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and"|FALSE
1|"the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to"|FALSE
1|"fight."|FALSE
1|"It is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli's that government"|FALSE
1|"should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the"|FALSE
1|"people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society;"|FALSE
1|"to this \"high argument\" \"The Prince\" contributes but little. Machiavelli"|FALSE
1|"always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than"|FALSE
1|"as he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that his"|FALSE
1|"work is of abiding value. But what invests \"The Prince\" with more than"|FALSE
1|"a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth"|FALSE
1|"that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and"|FALSE
1|"rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours."|FALSE
1|"In translating \"The Prince\" my aim has been to achieve at all costs an"|FALSE
1|"exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase"|FALSE
1|"adapted to the modern notions of style and expression. Machiavelli was"|FALSE
1|"no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged him"|FALSE
1|"to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, his"|FALSE
1|"manner nobly plain and serious. \"Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis"|FALSE
1|"rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?\" In \"The Prince,\" it may"|FALSE
1|"be truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but"|FALSE
1|"for the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare's time"|FALSE
1|"the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy"|FALSE
1|"task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled"|FALSE
1|"that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so"|FALSE
1|"simple. To take a single example: the word \"intrattenere,\" employed by"|FALSE
1|"Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards"|FALSE
1|"the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly"|FALSE
1|"rendered \"entertain,\" and every contemporary reader would understand"|FALSE
1|"what was meant by saying that \"Rome entertained the Aetolians and the"|FALSE
1|"Achaeans without augmenting their power.\" But to-day such a phrase would"|FALSE
1|"seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say"|FALSE
1|"that \"Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians,\" etc.,"|FALSE
1|"using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the"|FALSE
1|"pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute"|FALSE
1|"fidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can"|FALSE
1|"only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author's"|FALSE
1|"meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it."|FALSE

1|"     prolonged diligence, I now send, digested into a little volume, to"|FALSE
1|"     your Magnificence."|FALSE
1|"     And although I may consider this work unworthy of your"|FALSE

1|"     may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a"|FALSE
1|"     better gift than to offer you the opportunity of understanding in"|FALSE
1|"     the shortest time all that I have learnt in so many years, and"|FALSE
1|"     with so many troubles and dangers; which work I have not"|FALSE
1|"     embellished with swelling or magnificent words, nor stuffed with"|FALSE

1|"     or else that the truth of the matter and the weightiness of the"|FALSE

1|"     Nor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man"|FALSE
1|"     of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the"|FALSE
1|"     concerns of princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes"|FALSE
1|"     place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the nature of"|FALSE
1|"     the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate the"|FALSE
1|"     plains place themselves upon high mountains, even so to understand"|FALSE

1|"THE PRINCE"|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER I -- HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT"|FALSE
1|"MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED"|FALSE
1|"All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been"|FALSE
1|"and are either republics or principalities."|FALSE
1|"Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long"|FALSE
1|"established; or they are new."|FALSE
1|"The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or"|FALSE
1|"they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the"|FALSE
1|"prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of"|FALSE
1|"the King of Spain."|FALSE
1|"Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a"|FALSE
1|"prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of"|FALSE
1|"the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER II -- CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES"|FALSE
1|"I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another"|FALSE
1|"place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to"|FALSE
1|"principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,"|FALSE
1|"and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved."|FALSE
1|"I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states,"|FALSE
1|"and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new"|FALSE
1|"ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his"|FALSE
1|"ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a"|FALSE
1|"prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he"|FALSE
1|"be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he"|FALSE
1|"should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the"|FALSE
1|"usurper, he will regain it."|FALSE
1|"We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have"|FALSE
1|"withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius"|FALSE
1|"in '10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the"|FALSE
1|"hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it"|FALSE
1|"happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause"|FALSE
1|"him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be"|FALSE
1|"naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration"|FALSE
1|"of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for"|FALSE
1|"one change always leaves the toothing for another."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER III -- CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES"|FALSE
1|"But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be"|FALSE
1|"not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken"|FALSE
1|"collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from"|FALSE
1|"an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for"|FALSE
1|"men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this"|FALSE
1|"hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they"|FALSE
1|"are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have"|FALSE
1|"gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common"|FALSE
1|"necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have"|FALSE
1|"submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships"|FALSE
1|"which he must put upon his new acquisition."|FALSE
1|"In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in"|FALSE
1|"seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends"|FALSE
1|"who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the"|FALSE
1|"way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,"|FALSE
1|"feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed"|FALSE
1|"forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill"|FALSE
1|"of the natives."|FALSE
1|"For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied"|FALSE
1|"Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it"|FALSE
1|"only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the"|FALSE
1|"gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future"|FALSE
1|"benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is"|FALSE
1|"very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,"|FALSE
1|"they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with"|FALSE
1|"little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the"|FALSE
1|"delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the"|FALSE
1|"weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was"|FALSE
1|"enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders;"|FALSE
1|"but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring"|FALSE
1|"the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and"|FALSE
1|"driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco"|FALSE
1|"     Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. He ruled over Milan"|FALSE
1|"     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510."|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second"|FALSE
1|"time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains"|FALSE
1|"to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what"|FALSE
1|"any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more"|FALSE
1|"securely in his acquisition than did the King of France."|FALSE
1|"Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an"|FALSE
1|"ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country"|FALSE
1|"and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them,"|FALSE
1|"especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and"|FALSE
1|"to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the"|FALSE
1|"prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other"|FALSE
1|"things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live"|FALSE
1|"quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and"|FALSE
1|"Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,"|FALSE
1|"although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the"|FALSE
1|"customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst"|FALSE
1|"themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only"|FALSE
1|"to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their"|FALSE
1|"former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor"|FALSE
1|"their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become"|FALSE
1|"entirely one body with the old principality."|FALSE
1|"But when states are acquired in a country differing in language,"|FALSE
1|"customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great"|FALSE
1|"energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real"|FALSE
1|"helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there."|FALSE
1|"This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made"|FALSE
1|"that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures"|FALSE
1|"taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would"|FALSE
1|"not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders"|FALSE
1|"are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one"|FALSE
1|"is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one"|FALSE
1|"can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged"|FALSE
1|"by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the"|FALSE
1|"prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and"|FALSE
1|"wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state"|FALSE
1|"from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince"|FALSE
1|"resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest"|FALSE
1|"difficulty."|FALSE
1|"The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,"|FALSE
1|"which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do"|FALSE
1|"this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A"|FALSE
1|"prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he"|FALSE
1|"can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of"|FALSE
1|"the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new"|FALSE
1|"inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered,"|FALSE
1|"are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily"|FALSE
1|"kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it"|FALSE
1|"should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In"|FALSE
1|"conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more"|FALSE
1|"faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being"|FALSE
1|"poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men"|FALSE
1|"ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge"|FALSE
1|"themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot;"|FALSE
1|"therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a"|FALSE
1|"kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge."|FALSE
1|"But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much"|FALSE
1|"more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the"|FALSE
1|"state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are"|FALSE
1|"exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting"|FALSE
1|"of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and"|FALSE
1|"all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their"|FALSE
1|"own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such"|FALSE
1|"guards are as useless as a colony is useful."|FALSE
1|"Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects"|FALSE
1|"ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful"|FALSE
1|"neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care"|FALSE
1|"that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get"|FALSE
1|"a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be"|FALSE
1|"introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of"|FALSE
1|"ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were"|FALSE
1|"brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where"|FALSE
1|"they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the"|FALSE
1|"usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters"|FALSE
1|"a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred"|FALSE
1|"which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those"|FALSE
1|"subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to"|FALSE
1|"himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has"|FALSE
1|"acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of"|FALSE
1|"too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and"|FALSE
1|"with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them,"|FALSE
1|"so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not"|FALSE
1|"properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and"|FALSE
1|"whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles."|FALSE
1|"The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these"|FALSE
1|"measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*)"|FALSE
1|"the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the"|FALSE
1|"greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority."|FALSE
1|"Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and"|FALSE
1|"Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was"|FALSE
1|"humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and"|FALSE
1|"Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor"|FALSE
1|"did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends"|FALSE
1|"without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them"|FALSE
1|"agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the"|FALSE
1|"Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,"|FALSE
1|"who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for"|FALSE
1|"which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is"|FALSE
1|"easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine"|FALSE
1|"is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it"|FALSE
1|"happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever,"|FALSE
1|"that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to"|FALSE
1|"detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or"|FALSE
1|"treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to"|FALSE
1|"cure. This it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise"|FALSE
1|"have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they"|FALSE
1|"can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen,"|FALSE
1|"they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them,"|FALSE
1|"there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles,"|FALSE
1|"dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them"|FALSE
1|"come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only"|FALSE
1|"to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight"|FALSE
1|"with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy;"|FALSE
1|"they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that"|FALSE
1|"ever please them which is for ever in the mouths of the wise ones of our"|FALSE
1|"time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of"|FALSE
1|"their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and"|FALSE
1|"is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good."|FALSE
1|"     (*) See remark in the introduction on the word"|FALSE
1|"     \"intrattenere.\""|FALSE
1|"But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the"|FALSE
1|"things mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as"|FALSE
1|"the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held"|FALSE
1|"possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he"|FALSE
1|"has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a"|FALSE
1|"state composed of divers elements."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\""|FALSE
1|"     born 1462, died 1515."|FALSE
1|"     (+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498."|FALSE
1|"King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who"|FALSE
1|"desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I"|FALSE
1|"will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a"|FALSE
1|"foothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every"|FALSE
1|"door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced to"|FALSE
1|"accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded"|FALSE
1|"very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some"|FALSE
1|"mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once"|FALSE
1|"the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines"|FALSE
1|"became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the"|FALSE
1|"Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of"|FALSE
1|"Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the"|FALSE
1|"Sienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could"|FALSE
1|"the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which,"|FALSE
1|"in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king"|FALSE
1|"master of two-thirds of Italy."|FALSE
1|"Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have"|FALSE
1|"maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid"|FALSE
1|"down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they"|FALSE
1|"were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church,"|FALSE
1|"some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to"|FALSE
1|"stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself"|FALSE
1|"secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in"|FALSE
1|"Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the"|FALSE
1|"Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening"|FALSE
1|"himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown"|FALSE
1|"themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much"|FALSE
1|"temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And"|FALSE
1|"having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so"|FALSE
1|"much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent"|FALSE
1|"his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into"|FALSE
1|"Italy."|FALSE
1|"And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and"|FALSE
1|"deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,"|FALSE
1|"divides it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in"|FALSE
1|"Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and"|FALSE
1|"the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas"|FALSE
1|"he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove"|FALSE
1|"him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn."|FALSE
1|"The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always"|FALSE
1|"do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but"|FALSE
1|"when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is"|FALSE
1|"folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with"|FALSE
1|"her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she"|FALSE
1|"ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with"|FALSE
1|"the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got"|FALSE
1|"a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not"|FALSE
1|"the excuse of that necessity."|FALSE
1|"Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,"|FALSE
1|"he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he"|FALSE
1|"brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not"|FALSE
1|"send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure"|FALSE
1|"him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the"|FALSE
1|"Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain"|FALSE
1|"into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble"|FALSE
1|"them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have"|FALSE
1|"consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have"|FALSE
1|"kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would"|FALSE
1|"never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also"|FALSE
1|"because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order"|FALSE
1|"to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not"|FALSE
1|"have had the courage."|FALSE
1|"And if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander"|FALSE
1|"and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given"|FALSE
1|"above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because"|FALSE
1|"it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And"|FALSE
1|"if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the"|FALSE
1|"Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the"|FALSE
1|"dissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I"|FALSE
1|"reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and"|FALSE
1|"how it ought to be kept."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis"|FALSE
1|"     XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles"|FALSE
1|"     VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the"|FALSE
1|"     crown."|FALSE
1|"     (+) The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d'Amboise,"|FALSE
1|"     created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510."|FALSE
1|"Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the"|FALSE
1|"conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and"|FALSE
1|"wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that"|FALSE
1|"is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes"|FALSE
1|"with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander,"|FALSE
1|"was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen"|FALSE
1|"observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied"|FALSE
1|"to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that"|FALSE
1|"otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such"|FALSE
1|"greatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church"|FALSE
1|"and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be"|FALSE
1|"attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or"|FALSE
1|"rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful"|FALSE
1|"is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by"|FALSE
1|"astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been"|FALSE
1|"raised to power."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER IV -- WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT"|FALSE
1|"REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH"|FALSE
1|"Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly"|FALSE
1|"acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the"|FALSE
1|"Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it"|FALSE
1|"was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole"|FALSE
1|"empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained"|FALSE
1|"themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose"|FALSE
1|"among themselves from their own ambitions."|FALSE
1|"I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to"|FALSE
1|"be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body"|FALSE
1|"of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his"|FALSE
1|"favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity"|FALSE
1|"by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons"|FALSE
1|"have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold"|FALSE
1|"them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince"|FALSE
1|"and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all"|FALSE
1|"the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and"|FALSE
1|"if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and"|FALSE
1|"official, and they do not bear him any particular affection."|FALSE
1|"The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the"|FALSE
1|"King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord,"|FALSE
1|"the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he"|FALSE
1|"sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as"|FALSE
1|"he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient"|FALSE
1|"body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them;"|FALSE
1|"they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away"|FALSE
1|"except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states"|FALSE
1|"will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk,"|FALSE
1|"but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the"|FALSE
1|"difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper"|FALSE
1|"cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be"|FALSE
1|"assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around"|FALSE
1|"him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being"|FALSE
1|"all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and"|FALSE
1|"one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted,"|FALSE
1|"as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned."|FALSE
1|"Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him"|FALSE
1|"united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the"|FALSE
1|"revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed"|FALSE
1|"in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there"|FALSE
1|"is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being"|FALSE
1|"exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit"|FALSE
1|"with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his"|FALSE
1|"victory, so he ought not to fear them after it."|FALSE
1|"The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because"|FALSE
1|"one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,"|FALSE
1|"for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,"|FALSE
1|"for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the"|FALSE
1|"victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with"|FALSE
1|"infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from"|FALSE
1|"those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated"|FALSE
1|"the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves"|FALSE
1|"the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either"|FALSE
1|"to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings"|FALSE
1|"the opportunity."|FALSE
1|"Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of"|FALSE
1|"Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and"|FALSE
1|"therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in"|FALSE
1|"the field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory,"|FALSE
1|"Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the"|FALSE
1|"above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have"|FALSE
1|"enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised"|FALSE
1|"in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves."|FALSE
1|"But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted"|FALSE
1|"like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the"|FALSE
1|"Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities"|FALSE
1|"there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them"|FALSE
1|"endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the"|FALSE
1|"power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed"|FALSE
1|"away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting"|FALSE
1|"afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself"|FALSE
1|"his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed"|FALSE
1|"there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other"|FALSE
1|"than the Romans were acknowledged."|FALSE
1|"When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with"|FALSE
1|"which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which"|FALSE
1|"others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;"|FALSE
1|"this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the"|FALSE
1|"conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER V -- CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH"|FALSE
1|"LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED"|FALSE
1|"Whenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been"|FALSE
1|"accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three"|FALSE
1|"courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the"|FALSE
1|"next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live"|FALSE
1|"under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an"|FALSE
1|"oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a government,"|FALSE
1|"being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without"|FALSE
1|"his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and"|FALSE
1|"therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it"|FALSE
1|"more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way."|FALSE
1|"There are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held"|FALSE
1|"Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy, nevertheless they"|FALSE
1|"lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,"|FALSE
1|"dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as"|FALSE
1|"the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did"|FALSE
1|"not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many"|FALSE
1|"cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them"|FALSE
1|"otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city"|FALSE
1|"accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be"|FALSE
1|"destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty"|FALSE
1|"and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time"|FALSE
1|"nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do or"|FALSE
1|"provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless"|FALSE
1|"they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately"|FALSE
1|"rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in"|FALSE
1|"bondage by the Florentines."|FALSE
1|"But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and"|FALSE
1|"his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to"|FALSE
1|"obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in"|FALSE
1|"making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern"|FALSE
1|"themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a"|FALSE
1|"prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But"|FALSE
1|"in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire"|FALSE
1|"for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their"|FALSE
1|"former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to"|FALSE
1|"reside there."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER VI -- CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE'S"|FALSE
1|"OWN ARMS AND ABILITY"|FALSE
1|"Let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities"|FALSE
1|"as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of"|FALSE
1|"state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and"|FALSE
1|"following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to"|FALSE
1|"the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wise"|FALSE
1|"man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate"|FALSE
1|"those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal"|FALSE
1|"theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the clever"|FALSE
1|"archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far"|FALSE
1|"distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow"|FALSE
1|"attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their"|FALSE
1|"strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of"|FALSE
1|"so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach."|FALSE
1|"I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is"|FALSE
1|"a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,"|FALSE
1|"accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired"|FALSE
1|"the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station"|FALSE
1|"presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other"|FALSE
1|"of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties."|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the"|FALSE
1|"strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no"|FALSE
1|"other state, is compelled to reside there in person."|FALSE
1|"But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,"|FALSE
1|"have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,"|FALSE
1|"and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not"|FALSE
1|"discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet"|FALSE
1|"he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to"|FALSE
1|"speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or"|FALSE
1|"founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular"|FALSE
1|"deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior"|FALSE
1|"to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. And in"|FALSE
1|"examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything"|FALSE
1|"to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould"|FALSE
1|"into the form which seemed best to them. Without that opportunity their"|FALSE
1|"powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers"|FALSE
1|"the opportunity would have come in vain."|FALSE
1|"It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of"|FALSE
1|"Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that"|FALSE
1|"they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of"|FALSE
1|"bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and"|FALSE
1|"that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become"|FALSE
1|"King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary that Cyrus"|FALSE
1|"should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes,"|FALSE
1|"and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace. Theseus"|FALSE
1|"could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians"|FALSE
1|"dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,"|FALSE
1|"and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby"|FALSE
1|"their country was ennobled and made famous."|FALSE
1|"Those who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire"|FALSE
1|"a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The"|FALSE
1|"difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules"|FALSE
1|"and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their"|FALSE
1|"government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there"|FALSE
1|"is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or"|FALSE
1|"more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction"|FALSE
1|"of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies"|FALSE
1|"all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm"|FALSE
1|"defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises"|FALSE
1|"partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and"|FALSE
1|"partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new"|FALSE
1|"things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens"|FALSE
1|"that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they"|FALSE
1|"do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise"|FALSE
1|"that the prince is endangered along with them."|FALSE
1|"It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter"|FALSE
1|"thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves"|FALSE
1|"or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate"|FALSE
1|"their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In the"|FALSE
1|"first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything;"|FALSE
1|"but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely"|FALSE
1|"endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the"|FALSE
1|"unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the"|FALSE
1|"nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade"|FALSE
1|"them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. And thus it is"|FALSE
1|"necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it"|FALSE
1|"may be possible to make them believe by force."|FALSE
1|"If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not"|FALSE
1|"have enforced their constitutions for long--as happened in our time to"|FALSE
1|"Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things"|FALSE
1|"immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means"|FALSE
1|"of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to"|FALSE
1|"believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating"|FALSE
1|"their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with"|FALSE
1|"ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those"|FALSE
1|"who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be"|FALSE
1|"respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured,"|FALSE
1|"and happy."|FALSE
1|"To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some"|FALSE
1|"resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind:"|FALSE
1|"it is Hiero the Syracusan.(*) This man rose from a private station to"|FALSE
1|"be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but"|FALSE
1|"opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their"|FALSE
1|"captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince. He was"|FALSE
1|"of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes"|FALSE
1|"of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king. This man"|FALSE
1|"abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances,"|FALSE
1|"made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such"|FALSE
1|"foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had"|FALSE
1|"endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER VII -- CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER"|FALSE
1|"BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE"|FALSE
1|"Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private"|FALSE
1|"citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they"|FALSE
1|"have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have"|FALSE
1|"many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state"|FALSE
1|"is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it;"|FALSE
1|"as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the"|FALSE
1|"Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might"|FALSE
1|"hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those"|FALSE
1|"emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens"|FALSE
1|"came to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the"|FALSE
1|"fortune of him who has elevated them--two most inconstant and unstable"|FALSE
1|"things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;"|FALSE
1|"because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not"|FALSE
1|"reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always"|FALSE
1|"lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they"|FALSE
1|"have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful."|FALSE
1|"States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature"|FALSE
1|"which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and"|FALSE
1|"correspondencies(*) fixed in such a way that the first storm will"|FALSE
1|"not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become"|FALSE
1|"princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be"|FALSE
1|"prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps,"|FALSE
1|"and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became"|FALSE
1|"princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS."|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"Le radici e corrispondenze,\" their roots (i.e."|FALSE
1|"     foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other"|FALSE
1|"     states--a common meaning of \"correspondence\" and"|FALSE
1|"     \"correspondency\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."|FALSE
1|"Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or"|FALSE
1|"fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and"|FALSE
1|"these are Francesco Sforza(*) and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper"|FALSE
1|"means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be"|FALSE
1|"Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties"|FALSE
1|"he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by"|FALSE
1|"the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of"|FALSE
1|"his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had"|FALSE
1|"taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and"|FALSE
1|"able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and"|FALSE
1|"fortunes of others had bestowed on him."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married"|FALSE
1|"     Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo"|FALSE
1|"     Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his"|FALSE
1|"     own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli was the accredited"|FALSE
1|"     agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia (1478-"|FALSE
1|"     1507) during the transactions which led up to the"|FALSE
1|"     assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and"|FALSE
1|"     along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left"|FALSE
1|"     an account, written ten years before \"The Prince,\" of the"|FALSE
1|"     proceedings of the duke in his \"Descritione del modo tenuto"|FALSE
1|"     dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,\""|FALSE
1|"     etc., a translation of which is appended to the present"|FALSE
1|"     work."|FALSE
1|"Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations"|FALSE
1|"may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will"|FALSE
1|"be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If,"|FALSE
1|"therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be"|FALSE
1|"seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not"|FALSE
1|"consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what"|FALSE
1|"better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions;"|FALSE
1|"and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but"|FALSE
1|"the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune."|FALSE
1|"Alexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had"|FALSE
1|"many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his"|FALSE
1|"way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church;"|FALSE
1|"and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan"|FALSE
1|"and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were"|FALSE
1|"already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw the"|FALSE
1|"arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in"|FALSE
1|"hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini"|FALSE
1|"and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore,"|FALSE
1|"to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make"|FALSE
1|"himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for him"|FALSE
1|"to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined"|FALSE
1|"to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this,"|FALSE
1|"but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of"|FALSE
1|"King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of"|FALSE
1|"the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan"|FALSE
1|"than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna,"|FALSE
1|"which yielded to him on the reputation of the king. The duke, therefore,"|FALSE
1|"having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to"|FALSE
1|"hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one,"|FALSE
1|"his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of"|FALSE
1|"France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which"|FALSE
1|"he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder"|FALSE
1|"him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and"|FALSE
1|"that the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning"|FALSE
1|"when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very"|FALSE
1|"unwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when"|FALSE
1|"he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the"|FALSE
1|"king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to"|FALSE
1|"depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others."|FALSE
1|"For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in"|FALSE
1|"Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,"|FALSE
1|"making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their"|FALSE
1|"rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few"|FALSE
1|"months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely"|FALSE
1|"to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini,"|FALSE
1|"having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to him"|FALSE
1|"soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the"|FALSE
1|"aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a"|FALSE
1|"meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion at"|FALSE
1|"Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke,"|FALSE
1|"all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restored"|FALSE
1|"his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French"|FALSE
1|"or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew"|FALSE
1|"so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor"|FALSE
1|"Pagolo--whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of"|FALSE
1|"attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses--the Orsini were"|FALSE
1|"reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power"|FALSE
1|"at Sinigalia.(*) Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their"|FALSE
1|"partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations"|FALSE
1|"to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the"|FALSE
1|"people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them"|FALSE
1|"all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice, and to be"|FALSE
1|"imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Sinigalia, 31st December 1502."|FALSE
1|"When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak"|FALSE
1|"masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave"|FALSE
1|"them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was"|FALSE
1|"full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing"|FALSE
1|"to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it"|FALSE
1|"necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer"|FALSE
1|"Ramiro d'Orco,(*) a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest"|FALSE
1|"power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the"|FALSE
1|"greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not"|FALSE
1|"advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but"|FALSE
1|"that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the"|FALSE
1|"country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their"|FALSE
1|"advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some"|FALSE
1|"hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people,"|FALSE
1|"and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any"|FALSE
1|"cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the"|FALSE
1|"natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro,"|FALSE
1|"and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at"|FALSE
1|"Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity of"|FALSE
1|"this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Ramiro d'Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua."|FALSE
1|"But let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding"|FALSE
1|"himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate"|FALSE
1|"dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great"|FALSE
1|"measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he"|FALSE
1|"wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for"|FALSE
1|"he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not"|FALSE
1|"support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to"|FALSE
1|"temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the"|FALSE
1|"kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta. It"|FALSE
1|"was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have"|FALSE
1|"quickly accomplished had Alexander lived."|FALSE
1|"Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future"|FALSE
1|"he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church"|FALSE
1|"might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which"|FALSE
1|"Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by"|FALSE
1|"exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as"|FALSE
1|"to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself"|FALSE
1|"all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their"|FALSE
1|"aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to"|FALSE
1|"himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die"|FALSE
1|"that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four"|FALSE
1|"things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had"|FALSE
1|"killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and"|FALSE
1|"few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the"|FALSE
1|"most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he"|FALSE
1|"intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia"|FALSE
1|"and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer"|FALSE
1|"to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom"|FALSE
1|"of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy"|FALSE
1|"his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena"|FALSE
1|"yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of"|FALSE
1|"the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he"|FALSE
1|"continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died,"|FALSE
1|"for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have"|FALSE
1|"stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces"|FALSE
1|"of others, but solely on his own power and ability."|FALSE
1|"But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He"|FALSE
1|"left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the"|FALSE
1|"rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto"|FALSE
1|"death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew"|FALSE
1|"so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations"|FALSE
1|"which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those"|FALSE
1|"armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have"|FALSE
1|"overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his foundations were"|FALSE
1|"good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome,"|FALSE
1|"although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni,"|FALSE
1|"the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect"|FALSE
1|"anything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished,"|FALSE
1|"at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. But"|FALSE
1|"if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,(*) everything"|FALSE
1|"would have been different to him. On the day that Julius the Second(+)"|FALSE
1|"was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might"|FALSE
1|"occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all,"|FALSE
1|"except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he"|FALSE
1|"himself would be on the point to die."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503."|FALSE
1|"     (+) Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San"|FALSE

1|"When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to"|FALSE
1|"blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to"|FALSE
1|"offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of"|FALSE
1|"others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and"|FALSE
1|"far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise,"|FALSE
1|"and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness"|FALSE

1|"for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy"|FALSE
1|"a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings"|FALSE
1|"and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend"|FALSE

1|"Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any"|FALSE
1|"cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became"|FALSE
1|"pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom he"|FALSE
1|"had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San"|FALSE
1|"Giorgio, and Ascanio.(*) The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him,"|FALSE
1|"Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and"|FALSE
1|"obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having"|FALSE
1|"relations with him. Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have"|FALSE
1|"created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to"|FALSE
1|"Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula. He who believes that new benefits"|FALSE
1|"will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his"|FALSE
1|"ultimate ruin."|FALSE
1|"     (*) San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio"|FALSE

1|"CHAPTER VIII -- CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY"|FALSE
1|"WICKEDNESS"|FALSE
1|"Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither"|FALSE
1|"of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is"|FALSE
1|"manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be"|FALSE
1|"more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are"|FALSE
1|"when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the"|FALSE
1|"principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private"|FALSE
1|"person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first"|FALSE
1|"method, it will be illustrated by two examples--one ancient, the other"|FALSE
1|"modern--and without entering further into the subject, I consider these"|FALSE
1|"two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them."|FALSE
1|"Agathocles, the Sicilian,(*) became King of Syracuse not only from"|FALSE
1|"a private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a"|FALSE
1|"potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous"|FALSE
1|"life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of"|FALSE
1|"mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,"|FALSE
1|"he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established"|FALSE
1|"in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself"|FALSE
1|"prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that"|FALSE
1|"which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding"|FALSE
1|"for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was"|FALSE
1|"fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senate"|FALSE
1|"of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the"|FALSE
1|"Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and"|FALSE
1|"the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom"|FALSE
1|"of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice"|FALSE
1|"routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was"|FALSE
1|"he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence,"|FALSE
1|"with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the"|FALSE
1|"siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were"|FALSE
1|"compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him,"|FALSE
1|"had to be content with the possession of Africa."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will"|FALSE
1|"see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as"|FALSE
1|"he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any"|FALSE
1|"one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were"|FALSE
1|"gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly"|FALSE
1|"held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent"|FALSE
1|"to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,"|FALSE
1|"without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but"|FALSE
1|"not glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and"|FALSE
1|"extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his"|FALSE
1|"greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be"|FALSE
1|"seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain."|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite"|FALSE
1|"wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent"|FALSE
1|"men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius."|FALSE
1|"In our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da"|FALSE
1|"Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up"|FALSE
1|"by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his"|FALSE
1|"youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under"|FALSE
1|"his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military"|FALSE
1|"profession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,"|FALSE
1|"and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body"|FALSE
1|"and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing"|FALSE
1|"a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some"|FALSE
1|"citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than"|FALSE
1|"its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So"|FALSE
1|"he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many"|FALSE
1|"years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look"|FALSE
1|"upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything"|FALSE
1|"except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not"|FALSE
1|"spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be"|FALSE
1|"accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he"|FALSE
1|"entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by"|FALSE
1|"the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to"|FALSE
1|"that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up."|FALSE
1|"Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew,"|FALSE
1|"and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he"|FALSE
1|"lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having"|FALSE
1|"arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a"|FALSE
1|"solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of"|FALSE
1|"Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual"|FALSE
1|"in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave"|FALSE
1|"discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son"|FALSE
1|"Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others"|FALSE
1|"answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be"|FALSE
1|"discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber,"|FALSE
1|"whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No"|FALSE
1|"sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and"|FALSE
1|"slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,"|FALSE
1|"mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief"|FALSE
1|"magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey"|FALSE
1|"him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He"|FALSE
1|"killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened"|FALSE
1|"himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in"|FALSE
1|"the year during which he held the principality, not only was he"|FALSE
1|"secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his"|FALSE
1|"neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that"|FALSE
1|"of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare"|FALSE
1|"Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was"|FALSE
1|"stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he"|FALSE
1|"was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in"|FALSE
1|"valour and wickedness."|FALSE
1|"Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after"|FALSE
1|"infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in"|FALSE
1|"his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be"|FALSE
1|"conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means"|FALSE
1|"of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the"|FALSE
1|"state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this"|FALSE
1|"follows from severities(*) being badly or properly used. Those may be"|FALSE
1|"called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are"|FALSE
1|"applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are"|FALSE
1|"not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage"|FALSE
1|"of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding"|FALSE
1|"they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than"|FALSE
1|"decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God"|FALSE
1|"or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is"|FALSE
1|"impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the"|FALSE
1|"     modern equivalent of Machiavelli's thought when he speaks of"|FALSE
1|"     \"crudelta\" than the more obvious \"cruelties.\""|FALSE
1|"Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought"|FALSE
1|"to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him"|FALSE
1|"to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat"|FALSE
1|"them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure"|FALSE
1|"them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either"|FALSE
1|"from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife"|FALSE
1|"in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach"|FALSE
1|"themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For"|FALSE
1|"injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less,"|FALSE
1|"they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that"|FALSE
1|"the flavour of them may last longer."|FALSE
1|"And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such"|FALSE
1|"a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall"|FALSE
1|"make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled"|FALSE
1|"times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help"|FALSE
1|"you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be"|FALSE
1|"under any obligation to you for them."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER IX -- CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY"|FALSE
1|"But coming to the other point--where a leading citizen becomes the"|FALSE
1|"prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,"|FALSE
1|"but by the favour of his fellow citizens--this may be called a civil"|FALSE
1|"principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to"|FALSE
1|"it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a principality"|FALSE
1|"is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the"|FALSE
1|"nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found,"|FALSE
1|"and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor"|FALSE
1|"oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the"|FALSE
1|"people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one"|FALSE
1|"of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy."|FALSE
1|"A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,"|FALSE
1|"accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles,"|FALSE
1|"seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation"|FALSE
1|"of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his"|FALSE
1|"shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, finding"|FALSE
1|"they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of"|FALSE
1|"themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority."|FALSE
1|"He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains"|FALSE
1|"himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of"|FALSE
1|"the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who"|FALSE
1|"consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule"|FALSE
1|"nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popular"|FALSE
1|"favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not"|FALSE
1|"prepared to obey him."|FALSE
1|"Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,"|FALSE
1|"satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is"|FALSE
1|"more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,"|FALSE
1|"while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added also"|FALSE
1|"that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because"|FALSE
1|"of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself,"|FALSE
1|"as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a"|FALSE
1|"hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he"|FALSE
1|"has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against"|FALSE
1|"him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always"|FALSE
1|"come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him"|FALSE
1|"whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is compelled to live"|FALSE
1|"always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles,"|FALSE
1|"being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away"|FALSE
1|"authority when it pleases him."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to"|FALSE
1|"be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their"|FALSE
1|"course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do"|FALSE
1|"not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be"|FALSE
1|"honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt"|FALSE
1|"with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a"|FALSE
1|"natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,"|FALSE
1|"especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in"|FALSE
1|"prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them."|FALSE
1|"But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it"|FALSE
1|"is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,"|FALSE
1|"and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they"|FALSE
1|"were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people"|FALSE
1|"ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they"|FALSE
1|"only ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to"|FALSE
1|"the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above"|FALSE
1|"everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may"|FALSE
1|"easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they"|FALSE
1|"receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more"|FALSE
1|"closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted"|FALSE
1|"to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours;"|FALSE
1|"and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary"|FALSE
1|"according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit"|FALSE
1|"them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people"|FALSE
1|"friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity."|FALSE
1|"Nabis,(*) Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece,"|FALSE
1|"and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country"|FALSE
1|"and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only"|FALSE
1|"necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would"|FALSE
1|"not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not let any"|FALSE
1|"one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \"He who builds on"|FALSE
1|"the people, builds on the mud,\" for this is true when a private citizen"|FALSE
1|"makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will"|FALSE
1|"free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates;"|FALSE
1|"wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the"|FALSE
1|"Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali(+) in Florence. But granted"|FALSE
1|"a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is"|FALSE
1|"a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other"|FALSE
1|"qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole"|FALSE
1|"people encouraged--such a one will never find himself deceived in them,"|FALSE
1|"and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under"|FALSE
1|"     Flamininus in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C."|FALSE
1|"     (+) Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in"|FALSE
1|"     Machiavelli's \"Florentine History,\" Book III."|FALSE
1|"These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the"|FALSE
1|"civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule"|FALSE
1|"personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their government"|FALSE
1|"is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill"|FALSE
1|"of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially"|FALSE
1|"in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either"|FALSE
1|"by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid"|FALSE
1|"tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and"|FALSE
1|"subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of"|FALSE
1|"a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in"|FALSE
1|"doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For such a prince"|FALSE
1|"cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have"|FALSE
1|"need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all"|FALSE
1|"promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him;"|FALSE
1|"but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then"|FALSE
1|"he finds but few. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous,"|FALSE
1|"inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore a wise prince ought to"|FALSE
1|"adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and"|FALSE
1|"kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will"|FALSE
1|"always find them faithful."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER X -- CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL"|FALSE
1|"PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED"|FALSE
1|"It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of"|FALSE
1|"these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in"|FALSE
1|"case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether"|FALSE
1|"he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite"|FALSE
1|"clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by"|FALSE
1|"their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise"|FALSE
1|"a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack"|FALSE
1|"them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot"|FALSE
1|"show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to"|FALSE
1|"defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been"|FALSE
1|"discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second"|FALSE
1|"case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision"|FALSE
1|"and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country."|FALSE
1|"And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the"|FALSE
1|"other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often"|FALSE
1|"repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are"|FALSE
1|"always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it"|FALSE
1|"will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well"|FALSE
1|"fortified, and is not hated by his people."|FALSE
1|"The cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country"|FALSE
1|"around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits"|FALSE
1|"them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,"|FALSE
1|"because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the"|FALSE
1|"taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they"|FALSE
1|"have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they"|FALSE
1|"always keep in public depots enough for one year's eating, drinking, and"|FALSE
1|"firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to"|FALSE
1|"the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community"|FALSE
1|"in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on"|FALSE
1|"the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military"|FALSE
1|"exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself"|FALSE
1|"odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only"|FALSE
1|"be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this"|FALSE
1|"world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole"|FALSE
1|"year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should"|FALSE
1|"reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt,"|FALSE
1|"they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will"|FALSE
1|"make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and"|FALSE
1|"courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one"|FALSE
1|"time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another"|FALSE
1|"time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly"|FALSE
1|"from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold."|FALSE
1|"Further, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin"|FALSE
1|"the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and"|FALSE
1|"ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince"|FALSE
1|"to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage"|FALSE
1|"is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any"|FALSE
1|"remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with"|FALSE
1|"their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that"|FALSE
1|"their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his"|FALSE
1|"defence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they"|FALSE
1|"confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is"|FALSE
1|"well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the"|FALSE
1|"minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not"|FALSE
1|"fail to support and defend them."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XI -- CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES"|FALSE
1|"It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching"|FALSE
1|"which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they"|FALSE
1|"are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held"|FALSE
1|"without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of"|FALSE
1|"religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the"|FALSE
1|"principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live."|FALSE
1|"These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have"|FALSE
1|"subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are"|FALSE
1|"not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,"|FALSE
1|"and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves."|FALSE
1|"Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by"|FALSE
1|"powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of"|FALSE
1|"them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act"|FALSE
1|"of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them."|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the"|FALSE
1|"Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from"|FALSE
1|"Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been"|FALSE
1|"called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)"|FALSE
1|"have valued the temporal power very slightly--yet now a king of France"|FALSE
1|"trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and"|FALSE
1|"to ruin the Venetians--although this may be very manifest, it does not"|FALSE
1|"appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory."|FALSE
1|"Before Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,(*) this country was"|FALSE
1|"under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the"|FALSE
1|"Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal"|FALSE
1|"anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the"|FALSE
1|"other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those about"|FALSE
1|"whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To"|FALSE
1|"restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it"|FALSE
1|"was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use"|FALSE
1|"of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and"|FALSE
1|"Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in"|FALSE
1|"their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and"|FALSE
1|"powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope,"|FALSE
1|"such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these"|FALSE
1|"annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness;"|FALSE
1|"for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with"|FALSE
1|"difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people"|FALSE
1|"should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the"|FALSE
1|"Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time"|FALSE
1|"to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the"|FALSE
1|"pope were little esteemed in Italy."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494."|FALSE
1|"Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that"|FALSE
1|"have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to"|FALSE
1|"prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by"|FALSE
1|"reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things"|FALSE
1|"which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although"|FALSE
1|"his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,"|FALSE
1|"nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,"|FALSE
1|"which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all"|FALSE
1|"his labours."|FALSE
1|"Pope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all"|FALSE
1|"the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the"|FALSE
1|"chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found"|FALSE
1|"the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been"|FALSE
1|"practised before Alexander's time. Such things Julius not only followed,"|FALSE
1|"but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the"|FALSE
1|"Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these"|FALSE
1|"enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,"|FALSE
1|"inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any"|FALSE
1|"private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within"|FALSE
1|"the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them"|FALSE
1|"some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the"|FALSE
1|"one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the"|FALSE
1|"other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the"|FALSE
1|"disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals"|FALSE

1|"MERCENARIES"|FALSE
1|"Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such"|FALSE
1|"principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having"|FALSE
1|"considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and"|FALSE
1|"having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and"|FALSE
1|"to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of"|FALSE
1|"offence and defence which belong to each of them."|FALSE
1|"We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his"|FALSE
1|"foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go"|FALSE
1|"to ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or"|FALSE
1|"composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws"|FALSE
1|"where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well"|FALSE
1|"armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion"|FALSE
1|"and shall speak of the arms."|FALSE
1|"I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state"|FALSE
1|"are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed."|FALSE
1|"Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds"|FALSE
1|"his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe;"|FALSE
1|"for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,"|FALSE
1|"valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the"|FALSE
1|"fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so"|FALSE
1|"long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war"|FALSE
1|"by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for"|FALSE
1|"keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient"|FALSE
1|"to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be"|FALSE
1|"your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take"|FALSE
1|"themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble"|FALSE
1|"to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by"|FALSE
1|"resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they"|FALSE
1|"formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet"|FALSE
1|"when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that"|FALSE
1|"Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in"|FALSE
1|"hand;(*) and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the"|FALSE
1|"truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have"|FALSE
1|"related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who"|FALSE
1|"have also suffered the penalty."|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"With chalk in hand,\" \"col gesso.\" This is one of the"|FALSE
1|"     _bons mots_ of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with"|FALSE
1|"     which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only"|FALSE
1|"     necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the"|FALSE
1|"     billets for his soldiers to conquer the country. Cf. \"The"|FALSE

1|"     Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,"|FALSE
1|"     rather than with swords to fight.\""|FALSE
1|"I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The"|FALSE
1|"mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they"|FALSE
1|"are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own"|FALSE

1|"ruined in the usual way."|FALSE
1|"And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,"|FALSE
1|"whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to,"|FALSE
1|"either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in"|FALSE
1|"person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its"|FALSE
1|"citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it"|FALSE
1|"ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so"|FALSE
1|"that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes and"|FALSE
1|"republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries"|FALSE
1|"doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a"|FALSE
1|"republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens"|FALSE
1|"than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood"|FALSE

1|"liberty."|FALSE
1|"Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against"|FALSE

1|"allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His father,"|FALSE
1|"Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna(+) of Naples, left her"|FALSE

1|"their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them,"|FALSE
1|"I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance,"|FALSE
1|"for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some"|FALSE
1|"have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their"|FALSE
1|"ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) and"|FALSE
1|"since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one"|FALSE
1|"will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have"|FALSE

1|"so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy;"|FALSE
1|"Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come"|FALSE
1|"to that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed as"|FALSE
1|"their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private"|FALSE
1|"position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa,"|FALSE
1|"nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to"|FALSE
1|"keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had"|FALSE
1|"no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The"|FALSE
1|"Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have"|FALSE
1|"acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men,"|FALSE
1|"when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was"|FALSE
1|"before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight"|FALSE
1|"on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And"|FALSE
1|"in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much"|FALSE
1|"territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much"|FALSE
1|"to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under"|FALSE
1|"Carmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him"|FALSE
1|"a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership),"|FALSE
1|"and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they"|FALSE
1|"feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they"|FALSE
1|"were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose"|FALSE
1|"again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to"|FALSE
1|"secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their"|FALSE

1|"recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more"|FALSE
1|"temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more states,"|FALSE
1|"for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their"|FALSE

1|"whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal"|FALSE
1|"power: in many others their citizens became princes. From this it came"|FALSE
1|"to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of"|FALSE

1|"The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,(*) the"|FALSE
1|"Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and"|FALSE
1|"Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came"|FALSE
1|"all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy;"|FALSE
1|"and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun"|FALSE
1|"by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the"|FALSE
1|"Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower"|FALSE
1|"the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. They did"|FALSE
1|"this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were"|FALSE
1|"unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them"|FALSE
1|"any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force"|FALSE
1|"of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to"|FALSE
1|"such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were"|FALSE
1|"not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used"|FALSE
1|"every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers,"|FALSE
1|"not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without"|FALSE
1|"ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the"|FALSE
1|"towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either"|FALSE
1|"with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. All these"|FALSE
1|"things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to"|FALSE

1|"himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune"|FALSE
1|"brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his"|FALSE
1|"rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and"|FALSE
1|"the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all"|FALSE
1|"expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did"|FALSE
1|"not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his"|FALSE
1|"auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs."|FALSE

1|"ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others;"|FALSE
1|"but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better"|FALSE
1|"opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one"|FALSE
1|"community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you"|FALSE

1|"with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real"|FALSE

1|"I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am"|FALSE
1|"unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I"|FALSE
1|"have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the"|FALSE
1|"Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like"|FALSE
1|"our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he"|FALSE
1|"could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces,"|FALSE
1|"and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens."|FALSE
1|"I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament"|FALSE

1|"Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed"|FALSE
1|"him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them"|FALSE
1|"on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to"|FALSE
1|"meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of"|FALSE
1|"others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind"|FALSE
1|"you fast."|FALSE
1|"Charles the Seventh,(*) the father of King Louis the Eleventh,(+) having"|FALSE
1|"by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized"|FALSE
1|"the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established"|FALSE
1|"in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry."|FALSE
1|"Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to"|FALSE
1|"enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now"|FALSE
1|"seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the"|FALSE
1|"reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of"|FALSE
1|"his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his"|FALSE
1|"men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so"|FALSE
1|"accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they"|FALSE
1|"can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot"|FALSE
1|"stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come"|FALSE
1|"off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become"|FALSE
1|"mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together"|FALSE
1|"are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much"|FALSE
1|"inferior to one's own forces. And this example proves it, for the"|FALSE
1|"kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had"|FALSE
1|"been enlarged or maintained."|FALSE

1|"     1403, died 1461."|FALSE
1|"     (+) Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483."|FALSE
1|"But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks"|FALSE
1|"well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have"|FALSE
1|"said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a principality"|FALSE
1|"cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise;"|FALSE
1|"and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster to the Roman"|FALSE
1|"Empire(*) should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only"|FALSE
1|"with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of"|FALSE
1|"the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised"|FALSE
1|"it passed away to others."|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"Many speakers to the House the other night in the"|FALSE
1|"     debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most"|FALSE

1|"     replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under"|FALSE

1|"uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength."|FALSE
1|"And one's own forces are those which are composed either of subjects,"|FALSE

1|"CHAPTER XIV -- THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF"|FALSE
1|"WAR"|FALSE
1|"A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else"|FALSE
1|"for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the"|FALSE
1|"sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it"|FALSE
1|"not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men"|FALSE
1|"to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is"|FALSE
1|"seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have"|FALSE
1|"lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect"|FALSE
1|"this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of"|FALSE
1|"the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person"|FALSE
1|"became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and"|FALSE
1|"troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other"|FALSE
1|"evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and"|FALSE
1|"this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard"|FALSE
1|"himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate"|FALSE
1|"between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who"|FALSE
1|"is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that"|FALSE
1|"the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there"|FALSE
1|"being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible"|FALSE
1|"for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not"|FALSE
1|"understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already"|FALSE
1|"mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them."|FALSE
1|"He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of"|FALSE
1|"war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in"|FALSE
1|"war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study."|FALSE
1|"As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well"|FALSE
1|"organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he"|FALSE
1|"accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of"|FALSE
1|"localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys"|FALSE
1|"open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and"|FALSE
1|"marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge"|FALSE
1|"is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and"|FALSE
1|"is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the"|FALSE
1|"knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any"|FALSE
1|"other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because"|FALSE
1|"the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for"|FALSE
1|"instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other"|FALSE
1|"countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can"|FALSE
1|"easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this"|FALSE
1|"skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should"|FALSE
1|"possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters,"|FALSE
1|"to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage."|FALSE
1|"Philopoemen,(*) Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which"|FALSE
1|"writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he"|FALSE
1|"never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in"|FALSE
1|"the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \"If"|FALSE
1|"the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here"|FALSE
1|"with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best"|FALSE
1|"advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,"|FALSE
1|"how ought we to pursue?\" And he would set forth to them, as he went, all"|FALSE
1|"the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion"|FALSE
1|"and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual"|FALSE
1|"discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected"|FALSE
1|"circumstances that he could not deal with."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Philopoemen, \"the last of the Greeks,\" born 252 B.C.,"|FALSE
1|"     died 183 B.C."|FALSE

1|"study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne"|FALSE
1|"themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,"|FALSE

1|"liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of"|FALSE
1|"Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and"|FALSE
1|"never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with"|FALSE
1|"industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity,"|FALSE
1|"so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XV -- CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES,"|FALSE
1|"ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED"|FALSE
1|"It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince"|FALSE
1|"towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on"|FALSE
1|"this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it"|FALSE
1|"again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of"|FALSE
1|"other people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall"|FALSE
1|"be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to"|FALSE
1|"follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for"|FALSE
1|"many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never"|FALSE
1|"been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one"|FALSE
1|"ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to"|FALSE
1|"be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who"|FALSE
1|"wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with"|FALSE
1|"what destroys him among so much that is evil."|FALSE
1|"Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know"|FALSE
1|"how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and"|FALSE
1|"discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken"|FALSE
1|"of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable"|FALSE
1|"for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and"|FALSE
1|"thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan"|FALSE
1|"term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who"|FALSE
1|"desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives"|FALSE
1|"himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous,"|FALSE
1|"one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another"|FALSE
1|"faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one"|FALSE
1|"affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere,"|FALSE
1|"another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous;"|FALSE
1|"one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every"|FALSE
1|"one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to"|FALSE
1|"exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because"|FALSE
1|"they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human"|FALSE
1|"conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently"|FALSE
1|"prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which"|FALSE
1|"would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,"|FALSE
1|"from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he"|FALSE
1|"may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need"|FALSE
1|"not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without"|FALSE
1|"which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is"|FALSE
1|"considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like"|FALSE
1|"virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which"|FALSE
1|"looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XVI -- CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS"|FALSE
1|"Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say"|FALSE
1|"that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality"|FALSE
1|"exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it,"|FALSE
1|"injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be"|FALSE
1|"exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach"|FALSE
1|"of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the"|FALSE
1|"name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so"|FALSE
1|"that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property,"|FALSE
1|"and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name"|FALSE
1|"of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do"|FALSE
1|"everything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his"|FALSE
1|"subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus,"|FALSE
1|"with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is"|FALSE
1|"affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the"|FALSE
1|"first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from"|FALSE
1|"it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of"|FALSE
1|"liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if"|FALSE
1|"he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in"|FALSE
1|"time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that"|FALSE
1|"with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself"|FALSE
1|"against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without"|FALSE
1|"burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality"|FALSE
1|"towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness"|FALSE
1|"towards those to whom he does not give, who are few."|FALSE
1|"We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have"|FALSE
1|"been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was"|FALSE
1|"assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he"|FALSE
1|"did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of"|FALSE
1|"France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on"|FALSE
1|"his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long"|FALSE
1|"thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or"|FALSE
1|"conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A"|FALSE
1|"prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he"|FALSE
1|"can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he"|FALSE
1|"is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account"|FALSE
1|"a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will"|FALSE
1|"enable him to govern."|FALSE
1|"And if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and"|FALSE
1|"many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,"|FALSE
1|"and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in"|FALSE
1|"fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is"|FALSE
1|"dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;"|FALSE
1|"and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;"|FALSE
1|"but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his"|FALSE
1|"expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should"|FALSE
1|"reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,"|FALSE
1|"who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends"|FALSE
1|"that which is his own or his subjects' or else that of others. In the"|FALSE
1|"first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect"|FALSE
1|"any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with"|FALSE
1|"his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that"|FALSE
1|"which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he"|FALSE
1|"would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours"|FALSE
1|"nor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and"|FALSE
1|"Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander"|FALSE
1|"that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that"|FALSE
1|"injures you."|FALSE
1|"And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst"|FALSE
1|"you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor"|FALSE
1|"or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a"|FALSE
1|"prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised"|FALSE
1|"and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to"|FALSE
1|"have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,"|FALSE
1|"than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to"|FALSE
1|"incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XVII -- CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS"|FALSE
1|"BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED"|FALSE
1|"Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every"|FALSE
1|"prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel."|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare"|FALSE
1|"Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the"|FALSE
1|"Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this"|FALSE
1|"be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful"|FALSE
1|"than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty,"|FALSE
1|"permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as he"|FALSE
1|"keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of"|FALSE
1|"cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those"|FALSE
1|"who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow"|FALSE
1|"murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people,"|FALSE
1|"whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the"|FALSE
1|"individual only."|FALSE
1|"     (*) During the rioting between the Cancellieri and"|FALSE
1|"     Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503."|FALSE
1|"And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the"|FALSE
1|"imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence"|FALSE
1|"Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign"|FALSE
1|"owing to its being new, saying:"|FALSE
1|"     \"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt"|FALSE
1|"     Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"(*)"|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he"|FALSE
1|"himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and"|FALSE
1|"humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and"|FALSE
1|"too much distrust render him intolerable."|FALSE
1|"     (*) . . . against my will, my fate"|FALSE
1|"     A throne unsettled, and an infant state,"|FALSE
1|"     Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs,"|FALSE
1|"     And guard with these severities my shores."|FALSE
1|"     Christopher Pitt."|FALSE
1|"Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than"|FALSE
1|"feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to"|FALSE
1|"be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it"|FALSE
1|"is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be"|FALSE
1|"dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that"|FALSE
1|"they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as"|FALSE
1|"you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,"|FALSE
1|"property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far"|FALSE
1|"distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that"|FALSE
1|"prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other"|FALSE
1|"precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by"|FALSE
1|"payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be"|FALSE
1|"earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied"|FALSE
1|"upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one"|FALSE
1|"who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which,"|FALSE
1|"owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their"|FALSE
1|"advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never"|FALSE
1|"fails."|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he"|FALSE
1|"does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well"|FALSE
1|"being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he"|FALSE
1|"abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their"|FALSE
1|"women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of"|FALSE
1|"someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,"|FALSE
1|"but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,"|FALSE
1|"because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss"|FALSE
1|"of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are"|FALSE
1|"never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always"|FALSE
1|"find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking"|FALSE
1|"life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But"|FALSE
1|"when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of"|FALSE
1|"soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation"|FALSE
1|"of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or"|FALSE
1|"disposed to its duties."|FALSE
1|"Among the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that"|FALSE
1|"having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men,"|FALSE
1|"to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or"|FALSE
1|"against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This"|FALSE
1|"arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his"|FALSE
1|"boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of"|FALSE
1|"his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not"|FALSE
1|"sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire"|FALSE
1|"his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal"|FALSE
1|"cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been"|FALSE
1|"sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most"|FALSE
1|"excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,"|FALSE
1|"against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from"|FALSE
1|"nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more"|FALSE
1|"license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was"|FALSE
1|"upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of"|FALSE
1|"the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,"|FALSE
1|"yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate"|FALSE
1|"punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in"|FALSE
1|"the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew"|FALSE
1|"much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others."|FALSE
1|"This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have"|FALSE
1|"destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the"|FALSE
1|"control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed"|FALSE
1|"itself, but contributed to his glory."|FALSE
1|"Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the"|FALSE
1|"conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing"|FALSE
1|"according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself"|FALSE
1|"on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must"|FALSE
1|"endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XVIII(*) -- CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP"|FALSE
1|"FAITH"|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"The present chapter has given greater offence than any"|FALSE
1|"     other portion of Machiavelli's writings.\" Burd, \"Il"|FALSE
1|"     Principe,\" p. 297."|FALSE
1|"Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and"|FALSE
1|"to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience"|FALSE
1|"has been that those princes who have done great things have held good"|FALSE
1|"faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect"|FALSE
1|"of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on"|FALSE
1|"their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,(*) the one"|FALSE
1|"by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the"|FALSE
1|"second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it"|FALSE
1|"is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary"|FALSE
1|"for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the"|FALSE
1|"man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers,"|FALSE
1|"who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to"|FALSE
1|"the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline;"|FALSE
1|"which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half"|FALSE
1|"beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make"|FALSE
1|"use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A"|FALSE
1|"prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought"|FALSE
1|"to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself"|FALSE
1|"against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a"|FALSE
1|"lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not"|FALSE
1|"understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought"|FALSE
1|"he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and"|FALSE
1|"when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men"|FALSE
1|"were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are"|FALSE
1|"bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe"|FALSE
1|"it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate"|FALSE
1|"reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples"|FALSE
1|"could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made"|FALSE
1|"void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who"|FALSE
1|"has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best."|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"Contesting,\" i.e. \"striving for mastery.\" Mr Burd"|FALSE
1|"     points out that this passage is imitated directly from"|FALSE
1|"     Cicero's \"De Officiis\": \"Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi,"|FALSE
1|"     unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud"|FALSE
1|"     proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad"|FALSE
1|"     posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\""|FALSE
1|"But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,"|FALSE
1|"and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and"|FALSE
1|"so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will"|FALSE
1|"always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent"|FALSE
1|"example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing"|FALSE
1|"else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he"|FALSE
1|"always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power"|FALSE
1|"in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would"|FALSE
1|"observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to"|FALSE
1|"his wishes,(*) because he well understood this side of mankind."|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad"|FALSE
1|"     votum).\" The words \"ad votum\" are omitted in the Testina"|FALSE
1|"     addition, 1550."|FALSE
1|"     Alexander never did what he said,"|FALSE
1|"     Cesare never said what he did."|FALSE
1|"     Italian Proverb."|FALSE
1|"Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities"|FALSE
1|"I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And"|FALSE
1|"I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe"|FALSE
1|"them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear"|FALSE
1|"merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a"|FALSE
1|"mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and"|FALSE
1|"know how to change to the opposite."|FALSE
1|"And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one,"|FALSE
1|"cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often"|FALSE
1|"forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,(*)"|FALSE
1|"friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to"|FALSE
1|"have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations"|FALSE
1|"of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the"|FALSE
1|"good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to"|FALSE
1|"set about it."|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"Contrary to fidelity\" or \"faith,\" \"contro alla fede,\""|FALSE
1|"     and \"tutto fede,\" \"altogether faithful,\" in the next"|FALSE
1|"     paragraph. It is noteworthy that these two phrases, \"contro"|FALSE
1|"     alla fede\" and \"tutto fede,\" were omitted in the Testina"|FALSE
1|"     edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal"|FALSE
1|"     authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word"|FALSE
1|"     \"fede\" was \"the faith,\" i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as"|FALSE
1|"     rendered here \"fidelity\" and \"faithful.\" Observe that the"|FALSE
1|"     word \"religione\" was suffered to stand in the text of the"|FALSE
1|"     Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of"|FALSE
1|"     belief, as witness \"the religion,\" a phrase inevitably"|FALSE
1|"     employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. South in his"|FALSE
1|"     Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this passage as"|FALSE
1|"     follows: \"That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,"|FALSE
1|"     Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his"|FALSE
1|"     political scheme: 'That the show of religion was helpful to"|FALSE
1|"     the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and"|FALSE
1|"     pernicious.'\""|FALSE
1|"For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything"|FALSE
1|"slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five"|FALSE
1|"qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether"|FALSE
1|"merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing"|FALSE
1|"more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men"|FALSE
1|"judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to"|FALSE
1|"everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees"|FALSE
1|"what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare"|FALSE
1|"not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty"|FALSE
1|"of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and"|FALSE
1|"especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges"|FALSE
1|"by the result."|FALSE
1|"For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding"|FALSE

1|"Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I"|FALSE

1|"It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,"|FALSE

1|"ways."|FALSE
1|"It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,"|FALSE
1|"effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should"|FALSE
1|"guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his"|FALSE
1|"actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his"|FALSE
1|"private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are"|FALSE
1|"irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can"|FALSE
1|"hope either to deceive him or to get round him."|FALSE
1|"That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,"|FALSE
1|"and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,"|FALSE
1|"provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by"|FALSE
1|"his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason"|FALSE
1|"a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his"|FALSE
1|"subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From"|FALSE
1|"the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,"|FALSE
1|"and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will"|FALSE

1|"affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and"|FALSE
1|"has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist"|FALSE
1|"every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did."|FALSE
1|"But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has"|FALSE
1|"only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince"|FALSE
1|"can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by"|FALSE
1|"keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary"|FALSE
1|"for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most"|FALSE

1|"And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side"|FALSE
1|"of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of"|FALSE
1|"punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the"|FALSE
1|"majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and"|FALSE
1|"the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the"|FALSE
1|"popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to"|FALSE
1|"conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the"|FALSE
1|"execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to"|FALSE
1|"the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and"|FALSE
1|"thus cannot hope for any escape."|FALSE
1|"Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content"|FALSE
1|"with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer"|FALSE
1|"Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the"|FALSE
1|"present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had"|FALSE
1|"conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer"|FALSE
1|"Giovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination"|FALSE
1|"the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the"|FALSE
1|"popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in"|FALSE
1|"Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the"|FALSE
1|"death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having"|FALSE
1|"information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence,"|FALSE
1|"who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to"|FALSE
1|"Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was"|FALSE
1|"ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan"|FALSE
1|"     1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli's"|FALSE
1|"     strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from"|FALSE
1|"     his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had"|FALSE
1|"     been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the"|FALSE
1|"     Boscoli conspiracy."|FALSE
1|"For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies"|FALSE
1|"of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it"|FALSE
1|"is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear"|FALSE
1|"everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have"|FALSE
1|"taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the"|FALSE
1|"people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important"|FALSE
1|"objects a prince can have."|FALSE
1|"Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and"|FALSE
1|"in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty"|FALSE
1|"and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its"|FALSE
1|"authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of"|FALSE
1|"the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths"|FALSE
1|"would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the"|FALSE
1|"hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to"|FALSE
1|"protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care"|FALSE
1|"of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be"|FALSE
1|"liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people"|FALSE
1|"for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who"|FALSE
1|"could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the"|FALSE
1|"king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or"|FALSE
1|"a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can"|FALSE
1|"draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs"|FALSE
1|"of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in"|FALSE
1|"their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish"|FALSE
1|"the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people."|FALSE
1|"It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths"|FALSE
1|"of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary"|FALSE
1|"to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great"|FALSE
1|"qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been"|FALSE
1|"killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing, therefore,"|FALSE
1|"to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the"|FALSE
1|"emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different"|FALSE
1|"to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for"|FALSE
1|"consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the"|FALSE
1|"affairs of those times."|FALSE
1|"It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to"|FALSE
1|"the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were"|FALSE
1|"Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son"|FALSE
1|"Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus."|FALSE
1|"There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the"|FALSE
1|"ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be"|FALSE
1|"contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to"|FALSE
1|"put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset"|FALSE
1|"with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing"|FALSE
1|"to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people"|FALSE
1|"loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince,"|FALSE
1|"whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and"|FALSE
1|"rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise"|FALSE
1|"upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to"|FALSE
1|"their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were"|FALSE
1|"always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great"|FALSE
1|"authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the"|FALSE
1|"principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,"|FALSE
1|"were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about"|FALSE
1|"injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes"|FALSE
1|"cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to"|FALSE
1|"avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they"|FALSE
1|"ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the"|FALSE
1|"most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had"|FALSE
1|"need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to"|FALSE
1|"the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,"|FALSE
1|"accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them."|FALSE
1|"From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being"|FALSE
1|"all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,"|FALSE
1|"and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died"|FALSE
1|"honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,"|FALSE
1|"and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,"|FALSE
1|"being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept"|FALSE
1|"both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor"|FALSE
1|"despised."|FALSE
1|"But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,"|FALSE
1|"who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not"|FALSE
1|"endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,"|FALSE
1|"having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt"|FALSE
1|"for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his"|FALSE
1|"administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as"|FALSE
1|"much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince"|FALSE
1|"wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that"|FALSE
1|"body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--it"|FALSE
1|"may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have to"|FALSE
1|"submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do"|FALSE
1|"you harm."|FALSE
1|"But let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,"|FALSE
1|"that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the"|FALSE
1|"fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by"|FALSE
1|"him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who"|FALSE
1|"allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the"|FALSE
1|"army conspired against him, and murdered him."|FALSE
1|"Turning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus"|FALSE
1|"Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men"|FALSE
1|"who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of"|FALSE
1|"iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad"|FALSE
1|"end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers"|FALSE
1|"friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned"|FALSE
1|"successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of"|FALSE
1|"the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished"|FALSE
1|"and awed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the"|FALSE
1|"actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show"|FALSE
1|"briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which"|FALSE
1|"natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate."|FALSE
1|"Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in"|FALSE
1|"Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome"|FALSE
1|"and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian"|FALSE
1|"soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the"|FALSE
1|"throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known"|FALSE
1|"that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear,"|FALSE
1|"elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained for"|FALSE
1|"Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two"|FALSE
1|"difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had"|FALSE
1|"caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where"|FALSE
1|"Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it"|FALSE
1|"dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack"|FALSE
1|"Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected"|FALSE
1|"emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and"|FALSE
1|"sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made"|FALSE
1|"Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true."|FALSE
1|"But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental"|FALSE
1|"affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus,"|FALSE
1|"little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had"|FALSE
1|"by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was"|FALSE
1|"compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and"|FALSE
1|"took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully"|FALSE
1|"examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and"|FALSE
1|"a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one,"|FALSE
1|"and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a"|FALSE
1|"new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme"|FALSE
1|"renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have"|FALSE
1|"conceived against him for his violence."|FALSE
1|"But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent"|FALSE
1|"qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and"|FALSE
1|"acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring"|FALSE
1|"of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which"|FALSE
1|"caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and"|FALSE
1|"cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single"|FALSE
1|"murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of"|FALSE
1|"Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those"|FALSE
1|"he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst"|FALSE
1|"of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like"|FALSE
1|"deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate"|FALSE
1|"courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear"|FALSE
1|"to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because"|FALSE
1|"they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury"|FALSE
1|"to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state."|FALSE
1|"Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a"|FALSE
1|"brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained"|FALSE
1|"in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and"|FALSE
1|"proved the emperor's ruin."|FALSE
1|"But let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to"|FALSE
1|"hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it,"|FALSE
1|"and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his"|FALSE
1|"people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave"|FALSE
1|"himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might"|FALSE
1|"indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining"|FALSE
1|"his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators,"|FALSE
1|"and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he"|FALSE
1|"fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and"|FALSE
1|"despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed."|FALSE
1|"It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike"|FALSE
1|"man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,"|FALSE
1|"of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the"|FALSE
1|"throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated"|FALSE
1|"and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought"|FALSE
1|"him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great"|FALSE
1|"indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession"|FALSE
1|"to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the"|FALSE
1|"imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity"|FALSE
1|"by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,"|FALSE
1|"practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger"|FALSE
1|"at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa"|FALSE
1|"rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy"|FALSE
1|"conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,"|FALSE
1|"besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were"|FALSE
1|"disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so"|FALSE
1|"many against him, murdered him."|FALSE
1|"I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being"|FALSE
1|"thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this"|FALSE
1|"discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this"|FALSE
1|"difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a"|FALSE
1|"far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some"|FALSE
1|"indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that"|FALSE
1|"are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were"|FALSE
1|"the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary"|FALSE
1|"to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more"|FALSE
1|"necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the"|FALSE
1|"people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful."|FALSE
1|"From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him"|FALSE
1|"twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend"|FALSE
1|"the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,"|FALSE
1|"putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them"|FALSE
1|"his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the"|FALSE
1|"hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people,"|FALSE
1|"he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of the"|FALSE
1|"Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it"|FALSE
1|"is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an"|FALSE
1|"hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old"|FALSE
1|"prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by"|FALSE
1|"those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this"|FALSE
1|"being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because"|FALSE
1|"there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new"|FALSE
1|"ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is"|FALSE
1|"old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary"|FALSE
1|"lord."|FALSE
1|"But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will"|FALSE
1|"consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been"|FALSE
1|"fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how"|FALSE
1|"it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number"|FALSE
1|"in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to"|FALSE
1|"unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for"|FALSE
1|"Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who"|FALSE
1|"was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly"|FALSE
1|"destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated"|FALSE
1|"Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread"|FALSE
1|"in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot"|FALSE
1|"imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow"|FALSE
1|"those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which"|FALSE
1|"are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper"|FALSE
1|"and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XX -- ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES"|FALSE
1|"OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?"|FALSE
1|"1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their"|FALSE
1|"subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;"|FALSE
1|"others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid"|FALSE
1|"themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning"|FALSE
1|"of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown"|FALSE
1|"and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on all"|FALSE
1|"of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states"|FALSE
1|"in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as"|FALSE
1|"comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit."|FALSE
1|"2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather"|FALSE
1|"when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by"|FALSE
1|"arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted"|FALSE
1|"become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your"|FALSE
1|"subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be"|FALSE
1|"armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be"|FALSE
1|"handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they"|FALSE
1|"quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,"|FALSE
1|"considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and"|FALSE
1|"service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm"|FALSE
1|"them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either"|FALSE
1|"for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions"|FALSE
1|"breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it"|FALSE
1|"follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already"|FALSE
1|"shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to"|FALSE
1|"defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore,"|FALSE
1|"as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always"|FALSE
1|"distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince"|FALSE
1|"acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then"|FALSE
1|"it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have"|FALSE
1|"been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and"|FALSE
1|"opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should"|FALSE
1|"be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be"|FALSE
1|"your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you."|FALSE
1|"3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed"|FALSE
1|"to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by"|FALSE
1|"fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their"|FALSE
1|"tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily."|FALSE
1|"This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way"|FALSE
1|"balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept"|FALSE
1|"for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;"|FALSE
1|"rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided"|FALSE
1|"cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always"|FALSE
1|"assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist."|FALSE
1|"The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the"|FALSE
1|"Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although"|FALSE
1|"they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these"|FALSE
1|"disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their"|FALSE
1|"differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not"|FALSE
1|"afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one"|FALSE
1|"party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,"|FALSE
1|"therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be"|FALSE
1|"permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the"|FALSE
1|"more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if"|FALSE
1|"war comes this policy proves fallacious."|FALSE
1|"4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the"|FALSE
1|"difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore"|FALSE
1|"fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who"|FALSE
1|"has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes"|FALSE
1|"enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have"|FALSE
1|"the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a"|FALSE
1|"ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that"|FALSE
1|"a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster"|FALSE
1|"some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown"|FALSE
1|"may rise higher."|FALSE
1|"5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance"|FALSE
1|"in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than"|FALSE
1|"among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince"|FALSE
1|"of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by"|FALSE
1|"others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies"|FALSE
1|"so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who"|FALSE
1|"at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of"|FALSE
1|"a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be"|FALSE
1|"gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to"|FALSE
1|"serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very"|FALSE
1|"necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had"|FALSE
1|"formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from"|FALSE
1|"them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect"|FALSE
1|"his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a"|FALSE
1|"prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he"|FALSE
1|"must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who"|FALSE
1|"did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only"|FALSE
1|"discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly"|FALSE
1|"with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy"|FALSE
1|"them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which"|FALSE
1|"can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is"|FALSE
1|"easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented"|FALSE
1|"under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of"|FALSE
1|"those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and"|FALSE
1|"encouraged him to seize it."|FALSE
1|"6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states"|FALSE
1|"more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit"|FALSE
1|"to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge"|FALSE
1|"from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use"|FALSE
1|"of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times"|FALSE
1|"has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he"|FALSE
1|"might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to"|FALSE
1|"his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the"|FALSE
1|"foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that"|FALSE
1|"without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli"|FALSE
1|"returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore,"|FALSE
1|"are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one"|FALSE
1|"way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus:"|FALSE
1|"the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners"|FALSE
1|"ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners"|FALSE
1|"than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan,"|FALSE
1|"built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the"|FALSE
1|"house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason"|FALSE
1|"the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because,"|FALSE
1|"although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the"|FALSE
1|"people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist"|FALSE
1|"a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our"|FALSE
1|"times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the"|FALSE
1|"Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed;"|FALSE
1|"for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait"|FALSE
1|"for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture"|FALSE
1|"of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist"|FALSE
1|"the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when"|FALSE
1|"Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied"|FALSE
1|"with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then"|FALSE
1|"and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the"|FALSE
1|"fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him"|FALSE
1|"who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame"|FALSE
1|"whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and"|FALSE
1|"     Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the"|FALSE
1|"     Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499."|FALSE

1|"     appointment: \"I have been with the signori,\" wrote"|FALSE

1|"CHAPTER XXI -- HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN"|FALSE
1|"Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting"|FALSE
1|"a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present"|FALSE
1|"King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he has"|FALSE
1|"risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the"|FALSE
1|"foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds"|FALSE
1|"you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the"|FALSE
1|"beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the"|FALSE
1|"foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without"|FALSE
1|"any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile"|FALSE
1|"occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;"|FALSE
1|"thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power"|FALSE
1|"and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and"|FALSE
1|"of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the"|FALSE
1|"foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him."|FALSE
1|"Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater"|FALSE
1|"schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and"|FALSE
1|"clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable"|FALSE
1|"example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,"|FALSE
1|"he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his"|FALSE
1|"achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds"|FALSE
1|"of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of"|FALSE
1|"them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other,"|FALSE
1|"that men have never been given time to work steadily against him."|FALSE
1|"Again, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal"|FALSE
1|"affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano,"|FALSE
1|"who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some"|FALSE
1|"extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of"|FALSE
1|"rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And a"|FALSE
1|"prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain"|FALSE
1|"for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man."|FALSE
1|"A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a"|FALSE
1|"downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he"|FALSE
1|"declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course"|FALSE
1|"will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two"|FALSE
1|"of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character"|FALSE
1|"that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not."|FALSE
1|"In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare"|FALSE
1|"yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if"|FALSE
1|"you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to"|FALSE
1|"the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been"|FALSE
1|"conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to"|FALSE
1|"protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want"|FALSE
1|"doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who"|FALSE
1|"loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand,"|FALSE
1|"court his fate."|FALSE
1|"Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive"|FALSE
1|"out the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of"|FALSE
1|"the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the"|FALSE
1|"Romans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed in"|FALSE
1|"the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to"|FALSE
1|"stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which has"|FALSE
1|"been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not"|FALSE
1|"to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by"|FALSE
1|"not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the"|FALSE
1|"guerdon of the conqueror.\" Thus it will always happen that he who is not"|FALSE
1|"your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend"|FALSE
1|"will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes,"|FALSE
1|"to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are"|FALSE
1|"generally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour"|FALSE
1|"of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although"|FALSE
1|"the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is"|FALSE
1|"indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are"|FALSE
1|"never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing"|FALSE
1|"you. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not"|FALSE
1|"show some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally"|FALSE
1|"yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he"|FALSE
1|"may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again."|FALSE
1|"In the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that"|FALSE
1|"you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it"|FALSE
1|"greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction"|FALSE
1|"of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved"|FALSE
1|"him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your"|FALSE
1|"assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be noted"|FALSE
1|"that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one"|FALSE
1|"more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless"|FALSE
1|"necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are"|FALSE
1|"at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being"|FALSE
1|"at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France against"|FALSE
1|"the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could"|FALSE
1|"have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the"|FALSE
1|"Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then"|FALSE
1|"in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of"|FALSE
1|"the parties."|FALSE
1|"Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe"|FALSE
1|"courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,"|FALSE
1|"because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid"|FALSE
1|"one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in"|FALSE
1|"knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to"|FALSE
1|"take the lesser evil."|FALSE
1|"A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour"|FALSE
1|"the proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his"|FALSE
1|"citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and"|FALSE
1|"agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be"|FALSE
1|"deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away"|FALSE
1|"from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the"|FALSE
1|"prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and"|FALSE
1|"designs in any way to honour his city or state."|FALSE
1|"Further, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles"|FALSE
1|"at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into"|FALSE
1|"guilds or into societies,(*) he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and"|FALSE
1|"associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy"|FALSE
1|"and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his"|FALSE
1|"rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything."|FALSE
1|"     (*) \"Guilds or societies,\" \"in arti o in tribu.\" \"Arti\" were"|FALSE
1|"     craft or trade guilds, cf. Florio: \"Arte . . . a whole"|FALSE
1|"     company of any trade in any city or corporation town.\" The"|FALSE
1|"     guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr"|FALSE
1|"     Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906)."|FALSE
1|"     Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called"|FALSE
1|"     \"artel,\" exist in Russia to-day, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace's"|FALSE
1|"     \"Russia,\" ed. 1905: \"The sons . . . were always during the"|FALSE
1|"     working season members of an artel. In some of the larger"|FALSE
1|"     towns there are artels of a much more complex kind--"|FALSE
1|"     permanent associations, possessing large capital, and"|FALSE
1|"     pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual"|FALSE
1|"     members.\" The word \"artel,\" despite its apparent similarity,"|FALSE
1|"     has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \"ars\" or"|FALSE
1|"     \"arte.\" Its root is that of the verb \"rotisya,\" to bind"|FALSE
1|"     oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only"|FALSE
1|"     another form of \"rota,\" which now signifies a \"regimental"|FALSE
1|"     company.\" In both words the underlying idea is that of a"|FALSE
1|"     body of men united by an oath. \"Tribu\" were possibly gentile"|FALSE
1|"     groups, united by common descent, and included individuals"|FALSE
1|"     connected by marriage. Perhaps our words \"sects\" or \"clans\""|FALSE
1|"     would be most appropriate."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XXII -- CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES"|FALSE
1|"The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they"|FALSE
1|"are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the"|FALSE
1|"first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is"|FALSE
1|"by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and"|FALSE
1|"faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how"|FALSE
1|"to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are"|FALSE
1|"otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error"|FALSE
1|"which he made was in choosing them."|FALSE
1|"There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of"|FALSE
1|"Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to"|FALSE
1|"be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there"|FALSE
1|"are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;"|FALSE
1|"another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which"|FALSE
1|"neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is"|FALSE
1|"the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore,"|FALSE
1|"it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he"|FALSE
1|"was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and"|FALSE
1|"bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the"|FALSE
1|"initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant,"|FALSE
1|"and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot"|FALSE
1|"hope to deceive him, and is kept honest."|FALSE
1|"But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one"|FALSE
1|"test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his"|FALSE
1|"own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in"|FALSE
1|"everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever"|FALSE
1|"be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his"|FALSE
1|"hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and"|FALSE
1|"never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned."|FALSE
1|"On the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study"|FALSE
1|"him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with"|FALSE
1|"him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he"|FALSE
1|"cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,"|FALSE
1|"many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him"|FALSE
1|"dread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,"|FALSE
1|"are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,"|FALSE
1|"the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XXIII -- HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED"|FALSE
1|"I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it"|FALSE
1|"is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless"|FALSE
1|"they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of"|FALSE
1|"whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own"|FALSE
1|"affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with"|FALSE
1|"difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they"|FALSE
1|"run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way"|FALSE
1|"of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that"|FALSE
1|"to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell"|FALSE
1|"you the truth, respect for you abates."|FALSE
1|"Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the"|FALSE
1|"wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking"|FALSE
1|"the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,"|FALSE
1|"and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and"|FALSE
1|"listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions."|FALSE
1|"With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry"|FALSE
1|"himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more"|FALSE
1|"freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of"|FALSE
1|"these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be"|FALSE
1|"steadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown"|FALSE
1|"by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls"|FALSE
1|"into contempt."|FALSE
1|"I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of"|FALSE
1|"affairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,"|FALSE
1|"said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything."|FALSE
1|"This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the"|FALSE
1|"above; for the emperor is a secretive man--he does not communicate his"|FALSE
1|"designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in"|FALSE
1|"carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are"|FALSE
1|"at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being"|FALSE
1|"pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he"|FALSE
1|"does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he"|FALSE
1|"wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the"|FALSE
1|"     Holy Roman Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of"|FALSE
1|"     Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus"|FALSE
1|"     became involved in Italian politics."|FALSE
1|"A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he"|FALSE
1|"wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one"|FALSE
1|"from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be"|FALSE
1|"a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the"|FALSE
1|"things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any"|FALSE
1|"consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be"|FALSE
1|"felt."|FALSE
1|"And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression"|FALSE
1|"of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good"|FALSE
1|"advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because"|FALSE
1|"this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise"|FALSE
1|"himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his"|FALSE
1|"affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. In"|FALSE
1|"this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long,"|FALSE
1|"because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from"|FALSE
1|"him."|FALSE
1|"But if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more"|FALSE
1|"than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to"|FALSE
1|"unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and"|FALSE
1|"the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them. And"|FALSE
1|"they are not to found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue"|FALSE
1|"to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it must be"|FALSE
1|"inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of"|FALSE
1|"the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good"|FALSE
1|"counsels."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XXIV -- WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES"|FALSE
1|"The previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince"|FALSE
1|"to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed"|FALSE
1|"in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions of"|FALSE
1|"a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary"|FALSE
1|"one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind"|FALSE
1|"far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the"|FALSE
1|"present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy"|FALSE
1|"it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a"|FALSE
1|"prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double"|FALSE
1|"glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and"|FALSE
1|"strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good"|FALSE
1|"example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince,"|FALSE
1|"shall lose his state by want of wisdom."|FALSE
1|"And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in"|FALSE
1|"Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan,"|FALSE
1|"and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in"|FALSE
1|"regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in"|FALSE
1|"the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the"|FALSE
1|"people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known"|FALSE
1|"how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that"|FALSE
1|"have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost."|FALSE
1|"Philip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who"|FALSE
1|"was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to"|FALSE
1|"the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a"|FALSE
1|"warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he"|FALSE
1|"sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the"|FALSE
1|"end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the"|FALSE
1|"kingdom."|FALSE
1|"Therefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their"|FALSE
1|"principalities after so many years' possession, but rather their own"|FALSE
1|"sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change"|FALSE
1|"(it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm"|FALSE
1|"against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they"|FALSE
1|"thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that"|FALSE
1|"the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall"|FALSE
1|"them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to"|FALSE
1|"have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never"|FALSE
1|"wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to"|FALSE
1|"restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will"|FALSE
1|"not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which"|FALSE
1|"does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and"|FALSE
1|"durable that depend on yourself and your valour."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XXV -- WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO"|FALSE
1|"WITHSTAND HER"|FALSE
1|"It is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the"|FALSE
1|"opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by"|FALSE
1|"fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and"|FALSE
1|"that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us"|FALSE
1|"believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let"|FALSE
1|"chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times"|FALSE
1|"because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and"|FALSE
1|"may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes"|FALSE
1|"pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion."|FALSE
1|"Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that"|FALSE
1|"Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,(*) but that she still"|FALSE
1|"leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less."|FALSE
1|"     (*) Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \"The older"|FALSE
1|"     one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty"|FALSE
1|"     King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this"|FALSE
1|"     miserable universe.\" Sorel's \"Eastern Question.\""|FALSE
1|"I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood"|FALSE
1|"overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away"|FALSE
1|"the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to"|FALSE
1|"its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,"|FALSE
1|"though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when"|FALSE
1|"the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences"|FALSE
1|"and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may"|FALSE
1|"pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so"|FALSE
1|"dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour"|FALSE
1|"has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where"|FALSE
1|"she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain"|FALSE
1|"her."|FALSE
1|"And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and"|FALSE
1|"which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open"|FALSE
1|"country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been"|FALSE
1|"defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either"|FALSE
1|"this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it"|FALSE
1|"would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning"|FALSE
1|"resistance to fortune in general."|FALSE
1|"But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be"|FALSE
1|"seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change"|FALSE
1|"of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes"|FALSE
1|"that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who"|FALSE
1|"relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that"|FALSE
1|"he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of"|FALSE
1|"the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will"|FALSE
1|"not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end"|FALSE
1|"which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there"|FALSE
1|"by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force,"|FALSE
1|"another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one"|FALSE
1|"succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of"|FALSE
1|"two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly,"|FALSE
1|"two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being"|FALSE
1|"cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than"|FALSE
1|"whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times."|FALSE
1|"This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently"|FALSE
1|"bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains"|FALSE
1|"his object and the other does not."|FALSE
1|"Changes in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs"|FALSE
1|"himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a"|FALSE
1|"way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if"|FALSE
1|"times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course"|FALSE
1|"of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know"|FALSE
1|"how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate"|FALSE
1|"from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always"|FALSE
1|"prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well"|FALSE
1|"to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn"|FALSE
1|"adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he"|FALSE
1|"changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed."|FALSE
1|"Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and"|FALSE
1|"found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action"|FALSE
1|"that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against"|FALSE
1|"Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians"|FALSE
1|"were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the"|FALSE
1|"enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless"|FALSE
1|"he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness"|FALSE
1|"and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute"|FALSE
1|"and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover"|FALSE
1|"the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of"|FALSE
1|"France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring"|FALSE
1|"to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it"|FALSE
1|"impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action"|FALSE
1|"accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have"|FALSE
1|"done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his"|FALSE
1|"plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have"|FALSE
1|"done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would"|FALSE
1|"have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a"|FALSE
1|"thousand fears."|FALSE
1|"I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they"|FALSE
1|"all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience"|FALSE
1|"the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go"|FALSE
1|"cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have"|FALSE
1|"deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him."|FALSE
1|"I conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind"|FALSE
1|"steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are"|FALSE
1|"successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider"|FALSE
1|"that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is"|FALSE
1|"a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and"|FALSE
1|"ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by"|FALSE
1|"the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is,"|FALSE
1|"therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are"|FALSE
1|"less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her."|FALSE
1|"CHAPTER XXVI -- AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS"|FALSE

1|"VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE"|FALSE
1|"DI GRAVINA ORSINI"|FALSE
1|"BY"|FALSE
1|"NICOLO MACHIAVELLI"|FALSE
1|"The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to"|FALSE
1|"clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been"|FALSE
1|"raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo"|FALSE
1|"and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence"|FALSE
1|"he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni"|FALSE
1|"Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city"|FALSE
1|"under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy."|FALSE
1|"These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and"|FALSE
1|"their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too"|FALSE
1|"powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek"|FALSE
1|"to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon"|FALSE
1|"this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia,"|FALSE
1|"to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,"|FALSE
1|"Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant"|FALSE
1|"of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci,"|FALSE
1|"the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and courage of the"|FALSE
1|"duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise"|FALSE
1|"bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they decided not to"|FALSE
1|"abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and"|FALSE
1|"they send their men to one place and another, promising to one party"|FALSE
1|"assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the"|FALSE
1|"common enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy,"|FALSE
1|"and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the"|FALSE
1|"people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution."|FALSE
1|"Thus it arose that, men's minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by"|FALSE
1|"certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was"|FALSE
1|"held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The"|FALSE
1|"castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;"|FALSE
1|"so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being"|FALSE
1|"carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from"|FALSE
1|"being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping"|FALSE
1|"upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being"|FALSE
1|"effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being"|FALSE
1|"encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the"|FALSE
1|"Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance."|FALSE
1|"Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose"|FALSE
1|"the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town,"|FALSE
1|"should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent"|FALSE
1|"again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying"|FALSE
1|"the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they"|FALSE
1|"ought not to wait for another opportunity."|FALSE
1|"But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and"|FALSE
1|"Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli,"|FALSE
1|"their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against"|FALSE
1|"his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against"|FALSE
1|"everybody's expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the"|FALSE
1|"enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering"|FALSE
1|"courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize"|FALSE
1|"before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to"|FALSE
1|"negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter"|FALSE
1|"he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by"|FALSE
1|"enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort:"|FALSE
1|"to all he gave money."|FALSE
1|"Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached"|FALSE
1|"Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the"|FALSE
1|"aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the duke"|FALSE
1|"resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of"|FALSE
1|"reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in"|FALSE
1|"any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man"|FALSE
1|"who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have"|FALSE
1|"the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality."|FALSE
1|"And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to"|FALSE
1|"him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a"|FALSE
1|"standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took"|FALSE
1|"every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such"|FALSE
1|"preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in"|FALSE
1|"separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there"|FALSE
1|"came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found"|FALSE
1|"himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open"|FALSE
1|"war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous"|FALSE
1|"to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of"|FALSE
1|"reconciliation."|FALSE
1|"And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in"|FALSE
1|"which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand"|FALSE
1|"ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed"|FALSE
1|"an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come"|FALSE
1|"personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the"|FALSE
1|"other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and"|FALSE
1|"other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and"|FALSE
1|"not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his"|FALSE
1|"permission."|FALSE
1|"This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,"|FALSE
1|"again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in"|FALSE
1|"his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the"|FALSE
1|"fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by"|FALSE
1|"the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends."|FALSE
1|"But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed"|FALSE
1|"his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November"|FALSE
1|"together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he"|FALSE
1|"stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini,"|FALSE
1|"who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the"|FALSE
1|"enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being"|FALSE
1|"concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke"|FALSE
1|"wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if"|FALSE
1|"he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke"|FALSE
1|"replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus"|FALSE
1|"become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to"|FALSE
1|"proceed against Sinigalia."|FALSE
1|"It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the"|FALSE
1|"fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give"|FALSE
1|"it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him"|FALSE
1|"to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being"|FALSE
1|"invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no"|FALSE
1|"suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French"|FALSE
1|"men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred"|FALSE
1|"lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena"|FALSE
1|"about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost"|FALSE
1|"cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for"|FALSE
1|"him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would"|FALSE
1|"cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation,"|FALSE
1|"and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of"|FALSE
1|"his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of"|FALSE
1|"his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards"|FALSE
1|"trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had"|FALSE
1|"corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait."|FALSE
1|"Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be"|FALSE
1|"on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most"|FALSE
1|"trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d'Euna,"|FALSE
1|"who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo,"|FALSE
1|"Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his"|FALSE
1|"followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain"|FALSE
1|"men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached"|FALSE
1|"Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the"|FALSE
1|"duke's quarters, where they should be seized."|FALSE
1|"The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which"|FALSE
1|"there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to"|FALSE
1|"assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from"|FALSE
1|"Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day"|FALSE
1|"of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade"|FALSE
1|"of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the"|FALSE
1|"infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms."|FALSE
1|"Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of"|FALSE
1|"the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who"|FALSE
1|"goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases"|FALSE
1|"of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is"|FALSE
1|"distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot"|FALSE
1|"and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs"|FALSE
1|"a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano,"|FALSE
1|"facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for"|FALSE
1|"a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which"|FALSE
1|"passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it,"|FALSE
1|"and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which"|FALSE
1|"crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into"|FALSE
1|"Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gate"|FALSE
1|"there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of"|FALSE
1|"the river forms one side."|FALSE
1|"The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and"|FALSE
1|"to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant"|FALSE
1|"from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men"|FALSE
1|"of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,"|FALSE
1|"which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty"|FALSE
1|"horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters"|FALSE
1|"having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and"|FALSE
1|"when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass"|FALSE
1|"over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and"|FALSE
1|"the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through"|FALSE
1|"which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town."|FALSE
1|"Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a"|FALSE
1|"few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a"|FALSE
1|"cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his"|FALSE
1|"approaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the"|FALSE
1|"man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that"|FALSE
1|"when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the"|FALSE
1|"duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended"|FALSE
1|"his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that"|FALSE
1|"it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers"|FALSE
1|"that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before"|FALSE
1|"the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with"|FALSE
1|"goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned"|FALSE
1|"to look after them."|FALSE
1|"But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in"|FALSE
1|"Sinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before"|FALSE
1|"his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling"|FALSE
1|"them--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of"|FALSE
1|"Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that"|FALSE
1|"Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined"|FALSE
1|"Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of"|FALSE
1|"their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;"|FALSE
1|"and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come"|FALSE
1|"himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came"|FALSE
1|"before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto,"|FALSE
1|"having made his obeisance, joined the others."|FALSE
1|"So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke's quarters,"|FALSE
1|"and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them"|FALSE
1|"prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men"|FALSE
1|"of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of"|FALSE
1|"Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini"|FALSE
1|"and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the"|FALSE
1|"destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and"|FALSE
1|"bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian"|FALSE
1|"houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country"|FALSE
1|"and saved themselves."|FALSE
1|"But the duke's soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the"|FALSE
1|"men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had"|FALSE
1|"not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have"|FALSE
1|"completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,"|FALSE
1|"the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into"|FALSE
1|"a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in"|FALSE
1|"keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of"|FALSE
1|"the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame"|FALSE
1|"for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di"|FALSE
1|"Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the"|FALSE
1|"pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and"|FALSE
1|"Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, in"|FALSE

1|"who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in"|FALSE

1|"or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have"|FALSE

1|"sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who"|FALSE
1|"these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody,"|FALSE
1|"and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read"|FALSE
1|"them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great"|FALSE
1|"men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such"|FALSE
1|"men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show"|FALSE
1|"her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all"|FALSE
1|"success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was"|FALSE
1|"one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in"|FALSE
1|"which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others,"|FALSE
1|"he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course"|FALSE
1|"of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his"|FALSE
1|"memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and"|FALSE
1|"fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that"|FALSE
1|"I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I"|FALSE
1|"know delight most in noble deeds."|FALSE
1|"The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families"|FALSE
1|"of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in"|FALSE
1|"estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son"|FALSE
1|"Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and"|FALSE
1|"for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an"|FALSE
1|"only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso"|FALSE
1|"dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live"|FALSE
1|"with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where"|FALSE
1|"he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person"|FALSE
1|"could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after"|FALSE
1|"sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called,"|FALSE
1|"had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for"|FALSE
1|"seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves"|FALSE
1|"of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something"|FALSE
1|"resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw"|FALSE
1|"the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and"|FALSE
1|"who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly"|FALSE
1|"fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to"|FALSE
1|"the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is"|FALSE
1|"customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When"|FALSE
1|"he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised"|FALSE
1|"or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves"|FALSE
1|"what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no"|FALSE
1|"children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for"|FALSE
1|"it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They"|FALSE
1|"baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As"|FALSE
1|"the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of"|FALSE
1|"wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those"|FALSE
1|"lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended"|FALSE
1|"to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his"|FALSE
1|"canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with"|FALSE
1|"this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was"|FALSE
1|"quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the"|FALSE
1|"age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer"|FALSE
1|"Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left"|FALSE
1|"off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,"|FALSE
1|"delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running,"|FALSE
1|"leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled"|FALSE
1|"his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did"|FALSE
1|"turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty"|FALSE
1|"deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow."|FALSE
1|"There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,"|FALSE
1|"named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,"|FALSE
1|"bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had"|FALSE
1|"often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a"|FALSE
1|"Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman"|FALSE
1|"resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most"|FALSE
1|"mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the"|FALSE
1|"top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had"|FALSE
1|"often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street"|FALSE
1|"in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far"|FALSE
1|"excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal"|FALSE
1|"authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer"|FALSE
1|"Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed"|FALSE
1|"of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater"|FALSE
1|"desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and"|FALSE
1|"asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a"|FALSE
1|"gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in"|FALSE
1|"the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and"|FALSE
1|"the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though"|FALSE
1|"he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer"|FALSE
1|"Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,"|FALSE
1|"nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and"|FALSE
1|"take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and"|FALSE
1|"in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was"|FALSE
1|"driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear"|FALSE
1|"that he would not be able to hold him much longer."|FALSE
1|"Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest"|FALSE
1|"to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was"|FALSE
1|"astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that"|FALSE
1|"virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true"|FALSE
1|"gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and"|FALSE
1|"could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and"|FALSE
1|"tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,"|FALSE
1|"and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what"|FALSE
1|"enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful"|FALSE
1|"modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to"|FALSE
1|"others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals,"|FALSE
1|"and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only"|FALSE
1|"by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached"|FALSE
1|"his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the"|FALSE
1|"Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the"|FALSE
1|"Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces."|FALSE
1|"Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this"|FALSE
1|"expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and"|FALSE
1|"his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all"|FALSE
1|"Lombardy."|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he"|FALSE
1|"left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many"|FALSE
1|"friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary"|FALSE
1|"for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son"|FALSE
1|"thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio"|FALSE
1|"to be his son's tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died"|FALSE
1|"Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that"|FALSE
1|"goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to"|FALSE
1|"the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father."|FALSE
1|"Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of"|FALSE
1|"Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created"|FALSE
1|"a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former"|FALSE
1|"universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical"|FALSE
1|"intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the"|FALSE
1|"head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer"|FALSE
1|"Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and"|FALSE
1|"holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;"|FALSE
1|"therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his"|FALSE
1|"eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards"|FALSE
1|"he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring"|FALSE
1|"him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him"|FALSE
1|"driven out of Lucca."|FALSE
1|"The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,"|FALSE
1|"who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became"|FALSE
1|"their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,"|FALSE
1|"with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting"|FALSE
1|"their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into"|FALSE
1|"his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the"|FALSE
1|"Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously"|FALSE
1|"fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and"|FALSE
1|"munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days"|FALSE
1|"in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with"|FALSE
1|"Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and"|FALSE
1|"Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed"|FALSE
1|"Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the"|FALSE
1|"portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling"|FALSE
1|"the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione"|FALSE
1|"entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio"|FALSE
1|"with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor"|FALSE
1|"was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of"|FALSE
1|"Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more"|FALSE
1|"than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who"|FALSE
1|"fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the"|FALSE
1|"headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most"|FALSE
1|"hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese."|FALSE
1|"As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party"|FALSE
1|"that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined"|FALSE
1|"to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in"|FALSE
1|"the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to"|FALSE
1|"Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this"|FALSE
1|"Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number"|FALSE
1|"of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against"|FALSE
1|"the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy"|FALSE
1|"withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and"|FALSE
1|"Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within"|FALSE
1|"about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse"|FALSE
1|"of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of"|FALSE
1|"Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the"|FALSE
1|"enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to"|FALSE
1|"be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio."|FALSE
1|"This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking"|FALSE
1|"that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew"|FALSE
1|"over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass"|FALSE
1|"in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and"|FALSE
1|"did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other"|FALSE
1|"side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences"|FALSE
1|"of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front"|FALSE
1|"of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was"|FALSE
1|"sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided"|FALSE
1|"to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to"|FALSE
1|"his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they"|FALSE
1|"would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had"|FALSE
1|"placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his"|FALSE
1|"less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly"|FALSE
1|"the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those"|FALSE
1|"on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing"|FALSE
1|"this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight"|FALSE
1|"of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy"|FALSE
1|"him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst"|FALSE
1|"he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into"|FALSE
1|"contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged,"|FALSE
1|"whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two"|FALSE
1|"portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long"|FALSE
1|"interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more"|FALSE
1|"valiant part of Castruccio's men were opposed to the weaker part of the"|FALSE
1|"enemy's troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged;"|FALSE
1|"and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were"|FALSE
1|"arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks."|FALSE
1|"So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on"|FALSE
1|"both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found"|FALSE
1|"themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying"|FALSE
1|"their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy,"|FALSE
1|"there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and"|FALSE
1|"knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had"|FALSE
1|"come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto,"|FALSE
1|"and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among"|FALSE
1|"whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was"|FALSE
1|"killed in the first onset."|FALSE
1|"This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that"|FALSE
1|"Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it"|FALSE
1|"appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of"|FALSE
1|"power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited"|FALSE
1|"for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of"|FALSE
1|"Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the"|FALSE
1|"murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the"|FALSE
1|"sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven"|FALSE
1|"off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to"|FALSE
1|"the knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him a"|FALSE
1|"proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his"|FALSE
1|"son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,"|FALSE
1|"fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained"|FALSE
1|"at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to"|FALSE
1|"death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to"|FALSE
1|"hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed"|FALSE
1|"the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa"|FALSE
1|"to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own"|FALSE
1|"way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and"|FALSE
1|"put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their"|FALSE
1|"lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at"|FALSE
1|"Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese"|FALSE
1|"with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against"|FALSE
1|"him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa,"|FALSE
1|"availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city."|FALSE
1|"They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly"|FALSE
1|"in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in"|FALSE
1|"their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be"|FALSE
1|"set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him"|FALSE
1|"from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and"|FALSE
1|"with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no"|FALSE
1|"resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the"|FALSE
1|"lords of Scale, where he died in poverty."|FALSE
1|"But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,"|FALSE
1|"and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people"|FALSE
1|"that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having"|FALSE
1|"obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the"|FALSE
1|"recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of"|FALSE
1|"Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a"|FALSE
1|"treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a"|FALSE
1|"fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of"|FALSE
1|"two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained"|FALSE
1|"at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in"|FALSE
1|"a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the"|FALSE
1|"pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and"|FALSE
1|"wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the"|FALSE
1|"lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by"|FALSE
1|"the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to"|FALSE
1|"defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca"|FALSE
1|"by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco"|FALSE
1|"Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he"|FALSE
1|"was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people."|FALSE
1|"At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into"|FALSE
1|"Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that"|FALSE
1|"he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred"|FALSE
1|"horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi,"|FALSE
1|"who was held in high estimation, because of the people's love for"|FALSE
1|"the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by"|FALSE
1|"Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was"|FALSE
1|"appointed the emperor's lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans"|FALSE
1|"were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out"|FALSE
1|"of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick"|FALSE
1|"created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the"|FALSE
1|"Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to"|FALSE
1|"accept him as their lord."|FALSE
1|"Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian"|FALSE
1|"affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines,"|FALSE
1|"who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help"|FALSE
1|"and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country,"|FALSE
1|"if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were"|FALSE
1|"Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero"|FALSE
1|"Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the"|FALSE
1|"secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of"|FALSE
1|"these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight"|FALSE
1|"in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the"|FALSE
1|"Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the"|FALSE
1|"country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country"|FALSE
1|"districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the"|FALSE
1|"men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the"|FALSE
1|"field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to"|FALSE
1|"his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces"|FALSE
1|"and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by"|FALSE
1|"the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the"|FALSE
1|"assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo"|FALSE
1|"called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own"|FALSE
1|"territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled"|FALSE
1|"to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves."|FALSE
1|"Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato,"|FALSE
1|"inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines"|FALSE
1|"recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio"|FALSE
1|"was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca."|FALSE
1|"There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so"|FALSE
1|"powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance"|FALSE
1|"him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not"|FALSE
1|"received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited"|FALSE
1|"other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found"|FALSE
1|"their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the"|FALSE
1|"lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him."|FALSE
1|"They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a"|FALSE
1|"peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and"|FALSE
1|"compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered"|FALSE
1|"to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what"|FALSE
1|"they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater"|FALSE
1|"intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard"|FALSE
1|"the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi"|FALSE
1|"in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home."|FALSE
1|"Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he"|FALSE
1|"posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As"|FALSE
1|"it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to"|FALSE
1|"him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,"|FALSE
1|"for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to"|FALSE
1|"pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their"|FALSE
1|"former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to"|FALSE
1|"their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano"|FALSE
1|"to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find"|FALSE
1|"the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its"|FALSE
1|"inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying"|FALSE
1|"that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his"|FALSE
1|"clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they"|FALSE
1|"surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and"|FALSE
1|"put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato,"|FALSE
1|"whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not"|FALSE
1|"appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him."|FALSE
1|"He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they"|FALSE
1|"readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of"|FALSE
1|"getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for"|FALSE
1|"two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had"|FALSE
1|"made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention"|FALSE
1|"to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to"|FALSE
1|"the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences"|FALSE
1|"and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might"|FALSE
1|"aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them"|FALSE
1|"of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life"|FALSE
1|"also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to"|FALSE
1|"be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca"|FALSE
1|"with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out"|FALSE
1|"of the state."|FALSE
1|"Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his"|FALSE
1|"position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of"|FALSE
1|"increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could"|FALSE
1|"get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was"|FALSE
1|"his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with"|FALSE
1|"the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties"|FALSE
1|"confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had"|FALSE
1|"been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was"|FALSE
1|"Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men"|FALSE
1|"held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive"|FALSE
1|"the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to"|FALSE
1|"blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that"|FALSE
1|"of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than"|FALSE
1|"in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more"|FALSE
1|"ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to"|FALSE
1|"him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he"|FALSE
1|"would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo"|FALSE
1|"Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa,"|FALSE
1|"and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside"|FALSE
1|"the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders"|FALSE
1|"entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia,"|FALSE
1|"and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed"|FALSE
1|"the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia"|FALSE
1|"passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to"|FALSE
1|"leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him,"|FALSE
1|"making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside"|FALSE
1|"flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope"|FALSE
1|"and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great"|FALSE
1|"valour."|FALSE
1|"About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness"|FALSE
1|"of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The"|FALSE
1|"German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened--murders and"|FALSE
1|"tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end"|FALSE
1|"to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call"|FALSE
1|"in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the"|FALSE
1|"city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could"|FALSE
1|"apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only"|FALSE
1|"to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio"|FALSE
1|"considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this"|FALSE
1|"service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any"|FALSE
1|"time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command"|FALSE
1|"at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where"|FALSE
1|"he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time"|FALSE
1|"the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that,"|FALSE
1|"without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by"|FALSE
1|"reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa"|FALSE
1|"large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble."|FALSE
1|"When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others,"|FALSE
1|"voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many"|FALSE
1|"honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the"|FALSE
1|"greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had"|FALSE
1|"the following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\""|FALSE
1|"Whilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\""|FALSE
1|"During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio"|FALSE
1|"should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could"|FALSE
1|"tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult"|FALSE
1|"in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi"|FALSE
1|"and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These"|FALSE
1|"men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the"|FALSE
1|"aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out"|FALSE
1|"some of Castruccio's officials and partisans, and killing others, they"|FALSE
1|"restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to"|FALSE
1|"Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would"|FALSE
1|"lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the"|FALSE
1|"Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his"|FALSE
1|"road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph"|FALSE
1|"cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other"|FALSE
1|"hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard"|FALSE
1|"where the Florentines' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains"|FALSE
1|"of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as"|FALSE
1|"he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He"|FALSE
1|"believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured,"|FALSE
1|"although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men,"|FALSE
1|"whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence"|FALSE
1|"in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to"|FALSE
1|"attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers."|FALSE
1|"Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill"|FALSE
1|"which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a"|FALSE
1|"bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in"|FALSE
1|"general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit"|FALSE
1|"where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it."|FALSE
1|"The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio"|FALSE
1|"became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the"|FALSE
1|"castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed"|FALSE
1|"by either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he"|FALSE
1|"kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one."|FALSE
1|"For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified,"|FALSE
1|"he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men"|FALSE
1|"would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large"|FALSE
1|"masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not"|FALSE
1|"stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the"|FALSE
1|"immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and"|FALSE
1|"having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed"|FALSE
1|"matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted"|FALSE
1|"into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the"|FALSE
1|"castellan put to death."|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the"|FALSE
1|"Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away"|FALSE
1|"from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his"|FALSE
1|"army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached"|FALSE
1|"their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the"|FALSE
1|"following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at"|FALSE
1|"night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence"|FALSE
1|"at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he"|FALSE
1|"and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in"|FALSE
1|"the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road,"|FALSE
1|"and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the"|FALSE
1|"castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of"|FALSE
1|"their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in"|FALSE
1|"possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the"|FALSE
1|"castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill"|FALSE
1|"were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to"|FALSE
1|"pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked"|FALSE
1|"by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty"|FALSE
1|"they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When"|FALSE
1|"the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was"|FALSE
1|"filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably"|FALSE
1|"mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or"|FALSE
1|"forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult"|FALSE
1|"no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time"|FALSE
1|"the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy's infantry were scattered"|FALSE
1|"or killed without having made any effective defence because of their"|FALSE
1|"unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered"|FALSE
1|"a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on"|FALSE
1|"both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their"|FALSE
1|"friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a"|FALSE
1|"decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand"|FALSE
1|"infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred"|FALSE
1|"horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole"|FALSE
1|"force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out"|FALSE
1|"with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,"|FALSE
1|"but gave way, and were soon in full retreat--conquered more by their"|FALSE
1|"unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the"|FALSE
1|"rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each"|FALSE
1|"man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very"|FALSE
1|"sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were"|FALSE
1|"Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all"|FALSE
1|"Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the"|FALSE
1|"Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs."|FALSE
1|"Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the"|FALSE
1|"friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not"|FALSE
1|"content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both"|FALSE
1|"sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,"|FALSE
1|"about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the"|FALSE
1|"spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding"|FALSE
1|"horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals"|FALSE
1|"in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to"|FALSE
1|"corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city"|FALSE
1|"gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators"|FALSE
1|"in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and"|FALSE
1|"Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great"|FALSE
1|"anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to"|FALSE
1|"King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he,"|FALSE
1|"knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause"|FALSE
1|"was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from"|FALSE
1|"them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send his"|FALSE
1|"son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen."|FALSE
1|"Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the"|FALSE
1|"pressure of Castruccio's army, owing to his being compelled to leave"|FALSE
1|"his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a"|FALSE
1|"conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,"|FALSE
1|"one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland"|FALSE
1|"should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this"|FALSE
1|"conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy"|FALSE
1|"paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few"|FALSE
1|"are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy"|FALSE
1|"Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio."|FALSE
1|"This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio"|FALSE
1|"Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering"|FALSE
1|"their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put"|FALSE
1|"him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their"|FALSE
1|"families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and"|FALSE
1|"Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy"|FALSE
1|"upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their"|FALSE
1|"opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo,"|FALSE
1|"the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose"|FALSE
1|"no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand"|FALSE
1|"infantry and ten thousand cavalry--having called to their aid every"|FALSE
1|"Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack"|FALSE
1|"Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on"|FALSE
1|"the latter--a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to"|FALSE
1|"succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the"|FALSE
1|"surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa."|FALSE
1|"In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army"|FALSE
1|"and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from"|FALSE
1|"thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army"|FALSE
1|"which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree"|FALSE
1|"alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would"|FALSE
1|"deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to"|FALSE
1|"think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects"|FALSE
1|"of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand"|FALSE
1|"foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to"|FALSE
1|"Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand"|FALSE
1|"infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in"|FALSE
1|"the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and"|FALSE
1|"Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover,"|FALSE
1|"the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided"|FALSE
1|"their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction"|FALSE
1|"of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio's forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would"|FALSE
1|"find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own"|FALSE
1|"command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would"|FALSE
1|"have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an"|FALSE
1|"undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take"|FALSE
1|"this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the"|FALSE
1|"river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide"|FALSE
1|"expanse of land between them and the river."|FALSE
1|"The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to"|FALSE
1|"decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,"|FALSE
1|"having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the"|FALSE
1|"latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet"|FALSE
1|"the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the"|FALSE
1|"saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines"|FALSE
1|"commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten"|FALSE
1|"thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and"|FALSE
1|"who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five"|FALSE
1|"thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to"|FALSE
1|"issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand"|FALSE
1|"light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The"|FALSE
1|"infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the"|FALSE
1|"water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst"|FALSE
1|"the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the"|FALSE
1|"others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of"|FALSE
1|"the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over"|FALSE
1|"with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not"|FALSE
1|"move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were"|FALSE
1|"meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to"|FALSE
1|"find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for"|FALSE
1|"landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio"|FALSE
1|"had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and"|FALSE
1|"javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces"|FALSE
1|"and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the"|FALSE
1|"wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great"|FALSE
1|"confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the"|FALSE
1|"enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides"|FALSE
1|"fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers"|FALSE
1|"of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the"|FALSE
1|"Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for"|FALSE
1|"the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water"|FALSE
1|"would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged"|FALSE
1|"on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the"|FALSE
1|"same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the"|FALSE
1|"Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by"|FALSE
1|"the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted,"|FALSE
1|"and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that"|FALSE
1|"both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of"|FALSE
1|"infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting;"|FALSE
1|"he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended"|FALSE
1|"to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to"|FALSE
1|"the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took"|FALSE
1|"advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield."|FALSE
1|"But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio's reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell"|FALSE
1|"back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained"|FALSE
1|"any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his"|FALSE
1|"inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the"|FALSE
1|"defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that"|FALSE
1|"when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work"|FALSE
1|"of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the"|FALSE
1|"Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder"|FALSE
1|"of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with"|FALSE
1|"lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the"|FALSE
1|"enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine"|FALSE
1|"captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in"|FALSE
1|"crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower"|FALSE
1|"down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio's army."|FALSE
1|"But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of"|FALSE
1|"Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines"|FALSE
1|"were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them"|FALSE
1|"escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were"|FALSE
1|"taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo"|FALSE
1|"Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to"|FALSE
1|"Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater,"|FALSE
1|"as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell"|FALSE
1|"twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost"|FALSE
1|"one thousand five hundred and seventy men."|FALSE
1|"But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his"|FALSE
1|"life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined"|FALSE
1|"all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into"|FALSE
1|"effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death"|FALSE
1|"could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the"|FALSE
1|"whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and"|FALSE
1|"overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on"|FALSE
1|"their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the"|FALSE
1|"watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;"|FALSE
1|"he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the"|FALSE
1|"first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood"|FALSE
1|"exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno,"|FALSE
1|"and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which"|FALSE
1|"he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was"|FALSE
1|"the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high"|FALSE
1|"fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove"|FALSE
1|"fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and"|FALSE
1|"addressed him as follows:"|FALSE
1|"\"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the"|FALSE
1|"midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my"|FALSE
1|"successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have"|FALSE
1|"left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,"|FALSE
1|"because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and"|FALSE
1|"Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the"|FALSE
1|"Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these"|FALSE
1|"peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more"|FALSE
1|"peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one"|FALSE
1|"more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who"|FALSE
1|"insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me"|FALSE
1|"with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time"|FALSE
1|"to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have"|FALSE
1|"never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a"|FALSE
1|"boy--a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should"|FALSE
1|"feel--and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been"|FALSE
1|"born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and"|FALSE
1|"capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been"|FALSE
1|"witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his"|FALSE
1|"possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and"|FALSE
1|"increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in"|FALSE
1|"order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father"|FALSE
1|"left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have"|FALSE
1|"never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind"|FALSE
1|"from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I"|FALSE
1|"leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply"|FALSE
1|"concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast"|FALSE
1|"the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under"|FALSE
1|"they government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature"|FALSE
1|"changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held"|FALSE
1|"in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese."|FALSE
1|"Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and"|FALSE
1|"deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently"|FALSE
1|"inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines,"|FALSE
1|"injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who"|FALSE
1|"will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the"|FALSE
1|"acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan"|FALSE
1|"thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their"|FALSE
1|"help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything"|FALSE
1|"but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the"|FALSE
1|"prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou"|FALSE
1|"knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms"|FALSE
1|"with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great"|FALSE
1|"defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought"|FALSE
1|"to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would"|FALSE
1|"conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make"|FALSE
1|"friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages"|FALSE
1|"and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man"|FALSE
1|"should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and"|FALSE
1|"he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to"|FALSE
1|"govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule"|FALSE
1|"they conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my"|FALSE
1|"life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed"|FALSE
1|"when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And"|FALSE
1|"thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm"|FALSE
1|"and have taught thee how to keep it.\""|FALSE
1|"After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and"|FALSE
1|"Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo"|FALSE
1|"to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he"|FALSE
1|"died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no"|FALSE
1|"prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His"|FALSE
1|"obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried"|FALSE
1|"in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi"|FALSE
1|"as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long"|FALSE
1|"after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and"|FALSE
1|"only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the"|FALSE
1|"family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo."|FALSE
1|"From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a"|FALSE
1|"man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own"|FALSE
1|"time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above"|FALSE
1|"the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious"|FALSE
1|"presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke"|FALSE
1|"with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,"|FALSE
1|"and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or"|FALSE
1|"snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,"|FALSE
1|"but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false"|FALSE
1|"with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he"|FALSE
1|"desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory"|FALSE
1|"that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was"|FALSE
1|"bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He"|FALSE
1|"was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear"|FALSE
1|"nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that"|FALSE
1|"the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or"|FALSE
1|"biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any"|FALSE
1|"indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered"|FALSE
1|"with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has"|FALSE
1|"listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the"|FALSE
1|"following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge,"|FALSE
1|"and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had"|FALSE
1|"said: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\" \"That is true,\""|FALSE
1|"answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much less"|FALSE
1|"to me.\" Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that"|FALSE
1|"he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to let"|FALSE
1|"the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few"|FALSE
1|"little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may"|FALSE
1|"catch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience"|FALSE
1|"but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live"|FALSE
1|"so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice than you should"|FALSE
1|"not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\" Passing through a"|FALSE
1|"street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at"|FALSE
1|"being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamed"|FALSE
1|"when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\" A friend"|FALSE
1|"gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, do"|FALSE
1|"you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to"|FALSE
1|"fasten.\" Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"You"|FALSE
1|"are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best"|FALSE
1|"to eat,\" and was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to the"|FALSE
1|"houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\" Going by water from"|FALSE
1|"Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that"|FALSE
1|"sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him,"|FALSE
1|"who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he"|FALSE
1|"did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was"|FALSE
1|"worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he"|FALSE
1|"said: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat"|FALSE
1|"one piece of wood upon another.\" To a person who was boasting that he"|FALSE
1|"had read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boast"|FALSE
1|"of remembering many things.\" Someone bragged that he could drink much"|FALSE
1|"without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: \"An ox does the"|FALSE
1|"same.\" Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate"|FALSE
1|"relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was"|FALSE
1|"undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has not"|FALSE
1|"taken me in, I have taken her.\" Being also blamed for eating very dainty"|FALSE
1|"foods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\" and being"|FALSE
1|"told that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avaricious"|FALSE
1|"than I am gluttonous.\" Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and"|FALSE
1|"splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown"|FALSE
1|"by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones"|FALSE
1|"representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring."|FALSE
1|"Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon"|FALSE
1|"Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew not"|FALSE
1|"where to spit in order to offend thee less.\" Being asked how Caesar"|FALSE
1|"died he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\" Being one night in the"|FALSE
1|"house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was"|FALSE
1|"reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with"|FALSE
1|"them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who is"|FALSE
1|"considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\" A person"|FALSE
1|"came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening"|FALSE
1|"to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply"|FALSE
1|"reproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus for"|FALSE
1|"thou hast thy ears in thy feet,\" whereupon he obtained double the favour"|FALSE
1|"he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy"|FALSE
1|"one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled"|FALSE
1|"blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous"|FALSE
