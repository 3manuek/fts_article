836|"CHAPTER 1. THE EGG"|FALSE
836|"It began with the day when it was almost the Fifth of November, and a"|FALSE
836|"doubt arose in some breast--Robert's, I fancy--as to the quality of the"|FALSE
836|"fireworks laid in for the Guy Fawkes celebration."|FALSE
836|"'They were jolly cheap,' said whoever it was, and I think it was Robert,"|FALSE
836|"'and suppose they didn't go off on the night? Those Prosser kids would"|FALSE
836|"have something to snigger about then.'"|FALSE
836|"'The ones _I_ got are all right,' Jane said; 'I know they are, because"|FALSE
836|"the man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money--'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm sure thribble isn't grammar,' Anthea said."|FALSE
836|"'Of course it isn't,' said Cyril; 'one word can't be grammar all by"|FALSE
836|"itself, so you needn't be so jolly clever.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea was rummaging in the corner-drawers of her mind for a very"|FALSE
836|"disagreeable answer, when she remembered what a wet day it was, and how"|FALSE
836|"the boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on the"|FALSE
836|"top of the tram, which their mother had promised them as a reward for"|FALSE
836|"not having once forgotten, for six whole days, to wipe their boots on"|FALSE
836|"the mat when they came home from school."|FALSE
836|"So Anthea only said, 'Don't be so jolly clever yourself, Squirrel. And"|FALSE
836|"the fireworks look all right, and you'll have the eightpence that your"|FALSE
836|"tram fares didn't cost to-day, to buy something more with. You ought to"|FALSE
836|"get a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence.'"|FALSE
836|"'I daresay,' said Cyril, coldly; 'but it's not YOUR eightpence anyhow--'"|FALSE
836|"'But look here,' said Robert, 'really now, about the fireworks. We don't"|FALSE
836|"want to be disgraced before those kids next door. They think because"|FALSE
836|"they wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wouldn't wear plush if it was ever so--unless it was black to be"|FALSE
836|"beheaded in, if I was Mary Queen of Scots,' said Anthea, with scorn."|FALSE
836|"Robert stuck steadily to his point. One great point about Robert is the"|FALSE
836|"steadiness with which he can stick."|FALSE
836|"'I think we ought to test them,' he said."|FALSE
836|"'You young duffer,' said Cyril, 'fireworks are like postage-stamps. You"|FALSE
836|"can only use them once.'"|FALSE
836|"'What do you suppose it means by \"Carter's tested seeds\" in the"|FALSE
836|"advertisement?'"|FALSE
836|"There was a blank silence. Then Cyril touched his forehead with his"|FALSE
836|"finger and shook his head."|FALSE
836|"'A little wrong here,' he said. 'I was always afraid of that with poor"|FALSE
836|"Robert. All that cleverness, you know, and being top in algebra so"|FALSE
836|"often--it's bound to tell--'"|FALSE
836|"'Dry up,' said Robert, fiercely. 'Don't you see? You can't TEST seeds if"|FALSE
836|"you do them ALL. You just take a few here and there, and if those"|FALSE
836|"grow you can feel pretty sure the others will be--what do you call"|FALSE
836|"it?--Father told me--\"up to sample\". Don't you think we ought to sample"|FALSE
836|"the fire-works? Just shut our eyes and each draw one out, and then try"|FALSE
836|"them.'"|FALSE
836|"'But it's raining cats and dogs,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'And Queen Anne is dead,' rejoined Robert. No one was in a very good"|FALSE
836|"temper. 'We needn't go out to do them; we can just move back the table,"|FALSE
836|"and let them off on the old tea-tray we play toboggans with. I don't"|FALSE
836|"know what YOU think, but _I_ think it's time we did something, and"|FALSE
836|"that would be really useful; because then we shouldn't just HOPE the"|FALSE
836|"fireworks would make those Prossers sit up--we should KNOW.'"|FALSE
836|"'It WOULD be something to do,' Cyril owned with languid approval."|FALSE
836|"So the table was moved back. And then the hole in the carpet, that"|FALSE
836|"had been near the window till the carpet was turned round, showed most"|FALSE
836|"awfully. But Anthea stole out on tip-toe, and got the tray when cook"|FALSE
836|"wasn't looking, and brought it in and put it over the hole."|FALSE
836|"Then all the fireworks were put on the table, and each of the four"|FALSE
836|"children shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped"|FALSE
836|"something. Robert took a cracker, Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles;"|FALSE
836|"but Jane's fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection, the"|FALSE
836|"Jack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings, and one at least of the"|FALSE
836|"party--I will not say which, because it was sorry afterwards--declared"|FALSE
836|"that Jane had done it on purpose. Nobody was pleased. For the worst of"|FALSE
836|"it was that these four children, with a very proper dislike of anything"|FALSE
836|"even faintly bordering on the sneakish, had a law, unalterable as those"|FALSE
836|"of the Medes and Persians, that one had to stand by the results of a"|FALSE
836|"toss-up, or a drawing of lots, or any other appeal to chance, however"|FALSE
836|"much one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out."|FALSE
836|"'I didn't mean to,' said Jane, near tears. 'I don't care, I'll draw"|FALSE
836|"another--'"|FALSE
836|"'You know jolly well you can't,' said Cyril, bitterly. 'It's settled."|FALSE
836|"It's Medium and Persian. You've done it, and you'll have to stand by"|FALSE
836|"it--and us too, worse luck. Never mind. YOU'LL have your pocket-money"|FALSE
836|"before the Fifth. Anyway, we'll have the Jack-in-the-box LAST, and get"|FALSE
836|"the most out of it we can.'"|FALSE
836|"So the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted, and they were"|FALSE
836|"all that could be expected for the money; but when it came to the"|FALSE
836|"Jack-in-the-box it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them, as Cyril"|FALSE
836|"said. They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it with"|FALSE
836|"matches; they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocket"|FALSE
836|"of father's second-best overcoat that was hanging in the hall. And then"|FALSE
836|"Anthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the brooms"|FALSE
836|"and dustpans were kept, and the rosiny fire-lighters that smell so nice"|FALSE
836|"and like the woods where pine-trees grow, and the old newspapers and the"|FALSE
836|"bees-wax and turpentine, and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are used"|FALSE
836|"for cleaning brass and furniture, and the paraffin for the lamps. She"|FALSE
836|"came back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpence-halfpenny when"|FALSE
836|"it was full of red-currant jelly; but the jelly had been all eaten long"|FALSE
836|"ago, and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin. She came in, and"|FALSE
836|"she threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril was"|FALSE
836|"trying with the twenty-third match to light the Jack-in-the-box. The"|FALSE
836|"Jack-in-the-box did not catch fire any more than usual, but the paraffin"|FALSE
836|"acted quite differently, and in an instant a hot flash of flame leapt"|FALSE
836|"up and burnt off Cyril's eyelashes, and scorched the faces of all"|FALSE
836|"four before they could spring back. They backed, in four instantaneous"|FALSE
836|"bounds, as far as they could, which was to the wall, and the pillar of"|FALSE
836|"fire reached from floor to ceiling."|FALSE
836|"'My hat,' said Cyril, with emotion, 'You've done it this time, Anthea.'"|FALSE
836|"The flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire in"|FALSE
836|"Mr Rider Haggard's exciting story about Allan Quatermain. Robert and"|FALSE
836|"Cyril saw that no time was to be lost. They turned up the edges of the"|FALSE
836|"carpet, and kicked them over the tray. This cut off the column of fire,"|FALSE
836|"and it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadful"|FALSE
836|"smell of lamps that have been turned too low."|FALSE
836|"All hands now rushed to the rescue, and the paraffin fire was only a"|FALSE
836|"bundle of trampled carpet, when suddenly a sharp crack beneath their"|FALSE
836|"feet made the amateur firemen start back. Another crack--the carpet"|FALSE
836|"moved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it; the Jack-in-the-box had at"|FALSE
836|"last allowed itself to be lighted, and it was going off with desperate"|FALSE
836|"violence inside the carpet."|FALSE
836|"Robert, with the air of one doing the only possible thing, rushed to the"|FALSE
836|"window and opened it. Anthea screamed, Jane burst into tears, and"|FALSE
836|"Cyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap. But the"|FALSE
836|"firework went on, banging and bursting and spluttering even underneath"|FALSE
836|"the table."|FALSE
836|"Next moment mother rushed in, attracted by the howls of Anthea, and in a"|FALSE
836|"few moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence, and"|FALSE
836|"the children stood looking at each other's black faces, and, out of the"|FALSE
836|"corners of their eyes, at mother's white one."|FALSE
836|"The fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but little"|FALSE
836|"surprise, nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove the"|FALSE
836|"immediate end of the adventure. It has been said that all roads lead to"|FALSE
836|"Rome; this may be true, but at any rate, in early youth I am quite sure"|FALSE
836|"that many roads lead to BED, and stop there--or YOU do."|FALSE
836|"The rest of the fireworks were confiscated, and mother was not pleased"|FALSE
836|"when father let them off himself in the back garden, though he said,"|FALSE
836|"'Well, how else can you get rid of them, my dear?'"|FALSE
836|"You see, father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace, and"|FALSE
836|"that their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden. So that"|FALSE
836|"they all saw the fireworks most beautifully, and admired the skill with"|FALSE
836|"which father handled them."|FALSE
836|"Next day all was forgotten and forgiven; only the nursery had to"|FALSE
836|"be deeply cleaned (like spring-cleaning), and the ceiling had to be"|FALSE
836|"whitewashed."|FALSE
836|"And mother went out; and just at tea-time next day a man came with a"|FALSE
836|"rolled-up carpet, and father paid him, and mother said--"|FALSE
836|"'If the carpet isn't in good condition, you know, I shall expect you to"|FALSE
836|"change it.' And the man replied--"|FALSE
836|"'There ain't a thread gone in it nowhere, mum. It's a bargain, if ever"|FALSE
836|"there was one, and I'm more'n 'arf sorry I let it go at the price; but"|FALSE
836|"we can't resist the lydies, can we, sir?' and he winked at father and"|FALSE
836|"went away."|FALSE
836|"Then the carpet was put down in the nursery, and sure enough there"|FALSE
836|"wasn't a hole in it anywhere."|FALSE
836|"As the last fold was unrolled something hard and loud-sounding bumped"|FALSE
836|"out of it and trundled along the nursery floor. All the children"|FALSE
836|"scrambled for it, and Cyril got it. He took it to the gas. It was shaped"|FALSE
836|"like an egg, very yellow and shiny, half-transparent, and it had an odd"|FALSE
836|"sort of light in it that changed as you held it in different ways. It"|FALSE
836|"was as though it was an egg with a yolk of pale fire that just showed"|FALSE
836|"through the stone."|FALSE
836|"'I MAY keep it, mayn't I, mother?' Cyril asked."|FALSE
836|"And of course mother said no; they must take it back to the man who had"|FALSE
836|"brought the carpet, because she had only paid for a carpet, and not for"|FALSE
836|"a stone egg with a fiery yolk to it."|FALSE
836|"So she told them where the shop was, and it was in the Kentish Town"|FALSE
836|"Road, not far from the hotel that is called the Bull and Gate. It was"|FALSE
836|"a poky little shop, and the man was arranging furniture outside on the"|FALSE
836|"pavement very cunningly, so that the more broken parts should show as"|FALSE
836|"little as possible. And directly he saw the children he knew them again,"|FALSE
836|"and he began at once, without giving them a chance to speak."|FALSE
836|"'No you don't' he cried loudly; 'I ain't a-goin' to take back no"|FALSE
836|"carpets, so don't you make no bloomin' errer. A bargain's a bargain, and"|FALSE
836|"the carpet's puffik throughout.'"|FALSE
836|"'We don't want you to take it back,' said Cyril; 'but we found something"|FALSE
836|"in it.'"|FALSE
836|"'It must have got into it up at your place, then,' said the man, with"|FALSE
836|"indignant promptness, 'for there ain't nothing in nothing as I sell."|FALSE
836|"It's all as clean as a whistle.'"|FALSE
836|"'I never said it wasn't CLEAN,' said Cyril, 'but--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, if it's MOTHS,' said the man, 'that's easy cured with borax. But I"|FALSE
836|"expect it was only an odd one. I tell you the carpet's good through and"|FALSE
836|"through. It hadn't got no moths when it left my 'ands--not so much as an"|FALSE
836|"hegg.'"|FALSE
836|"'But that's just it,' interrupted Jane; 'there WAS so much as an egg.'"|FALSE
836|"The man made a sort of rush at the children and stamped his foot."|FALSE
836|"'Clear out, I say!' he shouted, 'or I'll call for the police. A nice"|FALSE
836|"thing for customers to 'ear you a-coming 'ere a-charging me with finding"|FALSE
836|"things in goods what I sells. 'Ere, be off, afore I sends you off with a"|FALSE
836|"flea in your ears. Hi! constable--'"|FALSE
836|"The children fled, and they think, and their father thinks, that they"|FALSE
836|"couldn't have done anything else. Mother has her own opinion."|FALSE
836|"But father said they might keep the egg."|FALSE
836|"'The man certainly didn't know the egg was there when he brought the"|FALSE
836|"carpet,' said he, 'any more than your mother did, and we've as much"|FALSE
836|"right to it as he had.'"|FALSE
836|"So the egg was put on the mantelpiece, where it quite brightened up the"|FALSE
836|"dingy nursery. The nursery was dingy, because it was a basement room,"|FALSE
836|"and its windows looked out on a stone area with a rockery made of"|FALSE
836|"clinkers facing the windows. Nothing grew in the rockery except London"|FALSE
836|"pride and snails."|FALSE
836|"The room had been described in the house agent's list as a 'convenient"|FALSE
836|"breakfast-room in basement,' and in the daytime it was rather dark. This"|FALSE
836|"did not matter so much in the evenings when the gas was alight, but then"|FALSE
836|"it was in the evening that the blackbeetles got so sociable, and used to"|FALSE
836|"come out of the low cupboards on each side of the fireplace where their"|FALSE
836|"homes were, and try to make friends with the children. At least, I"|FALSE
836|"suppose that was what they wanted, but the children never would."|FALSE
836|"On the Fifth of November father and mother went to the theatre, and"|FALSE
836|"the children were not happy, because the Prossers next door had lots of"|FALSE
836|"fireworks and they had none."|FALSE
836|"They were not even allowed to have a bonfire in the garden."|FALSE
836|"'No more playing with fire, thank you,' was father's answer, when they"|FALSE
836|"asked him."|FALSE
836|"When the baby had been put to bed the children sat sadly round the fire"|FALSE
836|"in the nursery."|FALSE
836|"'I'm beastly bored,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'Let's talk about the Psammead,' said Anthea, who generally tried to"|FALSE
836|"give the conversation a cheerful turn."|FALSE
836|"'What's the good of TALKING?' said Cyril. 'What I want is for something"|FALSE
836|"to happen. It's awfully stuffy for a chap not to be allowed out in the"|FALSE
836|"evenings. There's simply nothing to do when you've got through your"|FALSE
836|"homers.'"|FALSE
836|"Jane finished the last of her home-lessons and shut the book with a"|FALSE
836|"bang."|FALSE
836|"'We've got the pleasure of memory,' said she. 'Just think of last"|FALSE
836|"holidays.'"|FALSE
836|"Last holidays, indeed, offered something to think of--for they had"|FALSE
836|"been spent in the country at a white house between a sand-pit and a"|FALSE
836|"gravel-pit, and things had happened. The children had found a Psammead,"|FALSE
836|"or sand-fairy, and it had let them have anything they wished for--just"|FALSE
836|"exactly anything, with no bother about its not being really for their"|FALSE
836|"good, or anything like that. And if you want to know what kind of things"|FALSE
836|"they wished for, and how their wishes turned out you can read it all in"|FALSE
836|"a book called Five Children and It (It was the Psammead). If you've not"|FALSE
836|"read it, perhaps I ought to tell you that the fifth child was the baby"|FALSE
836|"brother, who was called the Lamb, because the first thing he ever said"|FALSE
836|"was 'Baa!' and that the other children were not particularly handsome,"|FALSE
836|"nor were they extra clever, nor extraordinarily good. But they were not"|FALSE
836|"bad sorts on the whole; in fact, they were rather like you."|FALSE
836|"'I don't want to think about the pleasures of memory,' said Cyril; 'I"|FALSE
836|"want some more things to happen.'"|FALSE
836|"'We're very much luckier than any one else, as it is,' said Jane. 'Why,"|FALSE
836|"no one else ever found a Psammead. We ought to be grateful.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why shouldn't we GO ON being, though?' Cyril asked--'lucky, I mean, not"|FALSE
836|"grateful. Why's it all got to stop?'"|FALSE
836|"'Perhaps something will happen,' said Anthea, comfortably. 'Do you know,"|FALSE
836|"sometimes I think we are the sort of people that things DO happen to.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's like that in history,' said Jane: 'some kings are full of"|FALSE
836|"interesting things, and others--nothing ever happens to them, except"|FALSE
836|"their being born and crowned and buried, and sometimes not that.'"|FALSE
836|"'I think Panther's right,' said Cyril: 'I think we are the sort of"|FALSE
836|"people things do happen to. I have a sort of feeling things would happen"|FALSE
836|"right enough if we could only give them a shove. It just wants something"|FALSE
836|"to start it. That's all.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish they taught magic at school,' Jane sighed. 'I believe if we"|FALSE
836|"could do a little magic it might make something happen.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wonder how you begin?' Robert looked round the room, but he got no"|FALSE
836|"ideas from the faded green curtains, or the drab Venetian blinds, or"|FALSE
836|"the worn brown oil-cloth on the floor. Even the new carpet suggested"|FALSE
836|"nothing, though its pattern was a very wonderful one, and always seemed"|FALSE
836|"as though it were just going to make you think of something."|FALSE
836|"'I could begin right enough,' said Anthea; 'I've read lots about it. But"|FALSE
836|"I believe it's wrong in the Bible.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's only wrong in the Bible because people wanted to hurt other"|FALSE
836|"people. I don't see how things can be wrong unless they hurt somebody,"|FALSE
836|"and we don't want to hurt anybody; and what's more, we jolly well"|FALSE
836|"couldn't if we tried. Let's get the Ingoldsby Legends. There's a thing"|FALSE
836|"about Abra-cadabra there,' said Cyril, yawning. 'We may as well play at"|FALSE
836|"magic. Let's be Knights Templars. They were awfully gone on magic. They"|FALSE
836|"used to work spells or something with a goat and a goose. Father says"|FALSE
836|"so.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, that's all right,' said Robert, unkindly; 'you can play the goat"|FALSE
836|"right enough, and Jane knows how to be a goose.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'll get Ingoldsby,' said Anthea, hastily. 'You turn up the hearthrug.'"|FALSE
836|"So they traced strange figures on the linoleum, where the hearthrug had"|FALSE
836|"kept it clean. They traced them with chalk that Robert had nicked"|FALSE
836|"from the top of the mathematical master's desk at school. You know, of"|FALSE
836|"course, that it is stealing to take a new stick of chalk, but it is not"|FALSE
836|"wrong to take a broken piece, so long as you only take one. (I do not"|FALSE
836|"know the reason of this rule, nor who made it.) And they chanted all the"|FALSE
836|"gloomiest songs they could think of. And, of course, nothing happened."|FALSE
836|"So then Anthea said, 'I'm sure a magic fire ought to be made of"|FALSE
836|"sweet-smelling wood, and have magic gums and essences and things in it.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't know any sweet-smelling wood, except cedar,' said Robert; 'but"|FALSE
836|"I've got some ends of cedar-wood lead pencil.'"|FALSE
836|"So they burned the ends of lead pencil. And still nothing happened."|FALSE
836|"'Let's burn some of the eucalyptus oil we have for our colds,' said"|FALSE
836|"Anthea."|FALSE
836|"And they did. It certainly smelt very strong. And they burned lumps"|FALSE
836|"of camphor out of the big chest. It was very bright, and made a horrid"|FALSE
836|"black smoke, which looked very magical. But still nothing happened. Then"|FALSE
836|"they got some clean tea-cloths from the dresser drawer in the kitchen,"|FALSE
836|"and waved them over the magic chalk-tracings, and sang 'The Hymn of the"|FALSE
836|"Moravian Nuns at Bethlehem', which is very impressive. And still nothing"|FALSE
836|"happened. So they waved more and more wildly, and Robert's tea-cloth"|FALSE
836|"caught the golden egg and whisked it off the mantelpiece, and it fell"|FALSE
836|"into the fender and rolled under the grate."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, crikey!' said more than one voice."|FALSE
836|"And every one instantly fell down flat on its front to look under the"|FALSE
836|"grate, and there lay the egg, glowing in a nest of hot ashes."|FALSE
836|"'It's not smashed, anyhow,' said Robert, and he put his hand under the"|FALSE
836|"grate and picked up the egg. But the egg was much hotter than any one"|FALSE
836|"would have believed it could possibly get in such a short time, and"|FALSE
836|"Robert had to drop it with a cry of 'Bother!' It fell on the top bar of"|FALSE
836|"the grate, and bounced right into the glowing red-hot heart of the fire."|FALSE
836|"'The tongs!' cried Anthea. But, alas, no one could remember where they"|FALSE
836|"were. Every one had forgotten that the tongs had last been used to fish"|FALSE
836|"up the doll's teapot from the bottom of the water-butt, where the Lamb"|FALSE
836|"had dropped it. So the nursery tongs were resting between the water-butt"|FALSE
836|"and the dustbin, and cook refused to lend the kitchen ones."|FALSE
836|"'Never mind,' said Robert, 'we'll get it out with the poker and the"|FALSE
836|"shovel.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, stop,' cried Anthea. 'Look at it! Look! look! look! I do believe"|FALSE
836|"something IS going to happen!'"|FALSE
836|"For the egg was now red-hot, and inside it something was moving. Next"|FALSE
836|"moment there was a soft cracking sound; the egg burst in two, and out of"|FALSE
836|"it came a flame-coloured bird. It rested a moment among the flames, and"|FALSE
836|"as it rested there the four children could see it growing bigger and"|FALSE
836|"bigger under their eyes."|FALSE
836|"Every mouth was a-gape, every eye a-goggle."|FALSE
836|"The bird rose in its nest of fire, stretched its wings, and flew out"|FALSE
836|"into the room. It flew round and round, and round again, and where it"|FALSE
836|"passed the air was warm. Then it perched on the fender. The children"|FALSE
836|"looked at each other. Then Cyril put out a hand towards the bird. It put"|FALSE
836|"its head on one side and looked up at him, as you may have seen a parrot"|FALSE
836|"do when it is just going to speak, so that the children were hardly"|FALSE
836|"astonished at all when it said, 'Be careful; I am not nearly cool yet.'"|FALSE
836|"They were not astonished, but they were very, very much interested."|FALSE
836|"They looked at the bird, and it was certainly worth looking at. Its"|FALSE
836|"feathers were like gold. It was about as large as a bantam, only its"|FALSE
836|"beak was not at all bantam-shaped. 'I believe I know what it is,' said"|FALSE
836|"Robert. 'I've seen a picture.'"|FALSE
836|"He hurried away. A hasty dash and scramble among the papers on father's"|FALSE
836|"study table yielded, as the sum-books say, 'the desired result'. But"|FALSE
836|"when he came back into the room holding out a paper, and crying, 'I say,"|FALSE
836|"look here,' the others all said 'Hush!' and he hushed obediently and"|FALSE
836|"instantly, for the bird was speaking."|FALSE
836|"'Which of you,' it was saying, 'put the egg into the fire?'"|FALSE
836|"'He did,' said three voices, and three fingers pointed at Robert."|FALSE
836|"The bird bowed; at least it was more like that than anything else."|FALSE
836|"'I am your grateful debtor,' it said with a high-bred air."|FALSE
836|"The children were all choking with wonder and curiosity--all except"|FALSE
836|"Robert. He held the paper in his hand, and he KNEW. He said so. He"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'_I_ know who you are.'"|FALSE
836|"And he opened and displayed a printed paper, at the head of which was a"|FALSE
836|"little picture of a bird sitting in a nest of flames."|FALSE
836|"'You are the Phoenix,' said Robert; and the bird was quite pleased."|FALSE
836|"'My fame has lived then for two thousand years,' it said. 'Allow me to"|FALSE
836|"look at my portrait.' It looked at the page which Robert, kneeling down,"|FALSE
836|"spread out in the fender, and said--"|FALSE
836|"'It's not a flattering likeness... And what are these characters?' it"|FALSE
836|"asked, pointing to the printed part."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, that's all dullish; it's not much about YOU, you know,' said Cyril,"|FALSE
836|"with unconscious politeness; 'but you're in lots of books.'"|FALSE
836|"'With portraits?' asked the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Well, no,' said Cyril; 'in fact, I don't think I ever saw any portrait"|FALSE
836|"of you but that one, but I can read you something about yourself, if you"|FALSE
836|"like.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix nodded, and Cyril went off and fetched Volume X of the old"|FALSE
836|"Encyclopedia, and on page 246 he found the following:--"|FALSE
836|"'Phoenix--in ornithology, a fabulous bird of antiquity.'"|FALSE
836|"'Antiquity is quite correct,' said the Phoenix, 'but fabulous--well, do"|FALSE
836|"I look it?'"|FALSE
836|"Every one shook its head. Cyril went on--"|FALSE
836|"'The ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its"|FALSE
836|"kind.'"|FALSE
836|"'That's right enough,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'They describe it as about the size of an eagle.'"|FALSE
836|"'Eagles are of different sizes,' said the Phoenix; 'it's not at all a"|FALSE
836|"good description.'"|FALSE
836|"All the children were kneeling on the hearthrug, to be as near the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix as possible."|FALSE
836|"'You'll boil your brains,' it said. 'Look out, I'm nearly cool now;' and"|FALSE
836|"with a whirr of golden wings it fluttered from the fender to the table."|FALSE
836|"It was so nearly cool that there was only a very faint smell of burning"|FALSE
836|"when it had settled itself on the table-cloth."|FALSE
836|"'It's only a very little scorched,' said the Phoenix, apologetically;"|FALSE
836|"'it will come out in the wash. Please go on reading.'"|FALSE
836|"The children gathered round the table."|FALSE
836|"'The size of an eagle,' Cyril went on, 'its head finely crested with a"|FALSE
836|"beautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and"|FALSE
836|"the rest of its body purple; only the tail white, and the eyes sparkling"|FALSE
836|"like stars. They say that it lives about five hundred years in the"|FALSE
836|"wilderness, and when advanced in age it builds itself a pile of sweet"|FALSE
836|"wood and aromatic gums, fires it with the wafting of its wings, and thus"|FALSE
836|"burns itself; and that from its ashes arises a worm, which in time grows"|FALSE
836|"up to be a Phoenix. Hence the Phoenicians gave--'"|FALSE
836|"'Never mind what they gave,' said the Phoenix, ruffling its golden"|FALSE
836|"feathers. 'They never gave much, anyway; they always were people who"|FALSE
836|"gave nothing for nothing. That book ought to be destroyed. It's"|FALSE
836|"most inaccurate. The rest of my body was never purple, and as for"|FALSE
836|"my--tail--well, I simply ask you, IS it white?'"|FALSE
836|"It turned round and gravely presented its golden tail to the children."|FALSE
836|"'No, it's not,' said everybody."|FALSE
836|"'No, and it never was,' said the Phoenix. 'And that about the worm"|FALSE
836|"is just a vulgar insult. The Phoenix has an egg, like all respectable"|FALSE
836|"birds. It makes a pile--that part's all right--and it lays its egg, and"|FALSE
836|"it burns itself; and it goes to sleep and wakes up in its egg, and comes"|FALSE
836|"out and goes on living again, and so on for ever and ever. I can't tell"|FALSE
836|"you how weary I got of it--such a restless existence; no repose.'"|FALSE
836|"'But how did your egg get HERE?' asked Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Ah, that's my life-secret,' said the Phoenix. 'I couldn't tell it to"|FALSE
836|"any one who wasn't really sympathetic. I've always been a misunderstood"|FALSE
836|"bird. You can tell that by what they say about the worm. I might tell"|FALSE
836|"YOU,' it went on, looking at Robert with eyes that were indeed starry."|FALSE
836|"'You put me on the fire--' Robert looked uncomfortable."|FALSE
836|"'The rest of us made the fire of sweet-scented woods and gums, though,'"|FALSE
836|"said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'And--and it was an accident my putting you on the fire,' said Robert,"|FALSE
836|"telling the truth with some difficulty, for he did not know how the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix might take it. It took it in the most unexpected manner."|FALSE
836|"'Your candid avowal,' it said, 'removes my last scruple. I will tell you"|FALSE
836|"my story.'"|FALSE
836|"'And you won't vanish, or anything sudden will you? asked Anthea,"|FALSE
836|"anxiously."|FALSE
836|"'Why?' it asked, puffing out the golden feathers, 'do you wish me to"|FALSE
836|"stay here?'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh YES,' said every one, with unmistakable sincerity."|FALSE
836|"'Why?' asked the Phoenix again, looking modestly at the table-cloth."|FALSE
836|"'Because,' said every one at once, and then stopped short; only Jane"|FALSE
836|"added after a pause, 'you are the most beautiful person we've ever"|FALSE
836|"seen.' 'You are a sensible child,' said the Phoenix, 'and I will NOT"|FALSE
836|"vanish or anything sudden. And I will tell you my tale. I had resided,"|FALSE
836|"as your book says, for many thousand years in the wilderness, which is"|FALSE
836|"a large, quiet place with very little really good society, and I was"|FALSE
836|"becoming weary of the monotony of my existence. But I acquired the habit"|FALSE
836|"of laying my egg and burning myself every five hundred years--and you"|FALSE
836|"know how difficult it is to break yourself of a habit.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Cyril; 'Jane used to bite her nails.'"|FALSE
836|"'But I broke myself of it,' urged Jane, rather hurt, 'You know I did.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not till they put bitter aloes on them,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'I doubt,' said the bird, gravely, 'whether even bitter aloes (the aloe,"|FALSE
836|"by the way, has a bad habit of its own, which it might well cure before"|FALSE
836|"seeking to cure others; I allude to its indolent practice of flowering"|FALSE
836|"but once a century), I doubt whether even bitter aloes could have cured"|FALSE
836|"ME. But I WAS cured. I awoke one morning from a feverish dream--it was"|FALSE
836|"getting near the time for me to lay that tiresome fire and lay that"|FALSE
836|"tedious egg upon it--and I saw two people, a man and a woman. They were"|FALSE
836|"sitting on a carpet--and when I accosted them civilly they narrated to"|FALSE
836|"me their life-story, which, as you have not yet heard it, I will now"|FALSE
836|"proceed to relate. They were a prince and princess, and the story of"|FALSE
836|"their parents was one which I am sure you will like to hear. In early"|FALSE
836|"youth the mother of the princess happened to hear the story of a certain"|FALSE
836|"enchanter, and in that story I am sure you will be interested. The"|FALSE
836|"enchanter--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, please don't,' said Anthea. 'I can't understand all these"|FALSE
836|"beginnings of stories, and you seem to be getting deeper and deeper in"|FALSE
836|"them every minute. Do tell us your OWN story. That's what we really want"|FALSE
836|"to hear.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said the Phoenix, seeming on the whole rather flattered, 'to"|FALSE
836|"cut about seventy long stories short (though _I_ had to listen to them"|FALSE
836|"all--but to be sure in the wilderness there is plenty of time), this"|FALSE
836|"prince and princess were so fond of each other that they did not want"|FALSE
836|"any one else, and the enchanter--don't be alarmed, I won't go into"|FALSE
836|"his history--had given them a magic carpet (you've heard of a magic"|FALSE
836|"carpet?), and they had just sat on it and told it to take them right"|FALSE
836|"away from every one--and it had brought them to the wilderness. And as"|FALSE
836|"they meant to stay there they had no further use for the carpet, so they"|FALSE
836|"gave it to me. That was indeed the chance of a lifetime!'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't see what you wanted with a carpet,' said Jane, 'when you've got"|FALSE
836|"those lovely wings.'"|FALSE
836|"'They ARE nice wings, aren't they?' said the Phoenix, simpering and"|FALSE
836|"spreading them out. 'Well, I got the prince to lay out the carpet, and I"|FALSE
836|"laid my egg on it; then I said to the carpet, \"Now, my excellent carpet,"|FALSE
836|"prove your worth. Take that egg somewhere where it can't be hatched for"|FALSE
836|"two thousand years, and where, when that time's up, some one will light"|FALSE
836|"a fire of sweet wood and aromatic gums, and put the egg in to hatch;\""|FALSE
836|"and you see it's all come out exactly as I said. The words were no"|FALSE
836|"sooner out of my beak than egg and carpet disappeared. The royal lovers"|FALSE
836|"assisted to arrange my pile, and soothed my last moments. I burnt myself"|FALSE
836|"up and knew no more till I awoke on yonder altar.'"|FALSE
836|"It pointed its claw at the grate."|FALSE
836|"'But the carpet,' said Robert, 'the magic carpet that takes you anywhere"|FALSE
836|"you wish. What became of that?'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, THAT?' said the Phoenix, carelessly--'I should say that that is the"|FALSE
836|"carpet. I remember the pattern perfectly.'"|FALSE
836|"It pointed as it spoke to the floor, where lay the carpet which mother"|FALSE
836|"had bought in the Kentish Town Road for twenty-two shillings and"|FALSE
836|"ninepence."|FALSE
836|"At that instant father's latch-key was heard in the door."|FALSE
836|"'OH,' whispered Cyril, 'now we shall catch it for not being in bed!'"|FALSE
836|"'Wish yourself there,' said the Phoenix, in a hurried whisper, 'and then"|FALSE
836|"wish the carpet back in its place.'"|FALSE
836|"No sooner said than done. It made one a little giddy, certainly, and a"|FALSE
836|"little breathless; but when things seemed right way up again, there the"|FALSE
836|"children were, in bed, and the lights were out."|FALSE
836|"They heard the soft voice of the Phoenix through the darkness."|FALSE
836|"'I shall sleep on the cornice above your curtains,' it said. 'Please"|FALSE
836|"don't mention me to your kinsfolk.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not much good,' said Robert, 'they'd never believe us. I say,' he"|FALSE
836|"called through the half-open door to the girls; 'talk about adventures"|FALSE
836|"and things happening. We ought to be able to get some fun out of a magic"|FALSE
836|"carpet AND a Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"'Rather,' said the girls, in bed."|FALSE
836|"'Children,' said father, on the stairs, 'go to sleep at once. What do"|FALSE
836|"you mean by talking at this time of night?'"|FALSE
836|"No answer was expected to this question, but under the bedclothes Cyril"|FALSE
836|"murmured one."|FALSE
836|"'Mean?' he said. 'Don't know what we mean. I don't know what anything"|FALSE
836|"means.'"|FALSE
836|"'But we've got a magic carpet AND a Phoenix,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'You'll get something else if father comes in and catches you,' said"|FALSE
836|"Cyril. 'Shut up, I tell you.'"|FALSE
836|"Robert shut up. But he knew as well as you do that the adventures of"|FALSE
836|"that carpet and that Phoenix were only just beginning."|FALSE
836|"Father and mother had not the least idea of what had happened in their"|FALSE
836|"absence. This is often the case, even when there are no magic carpets or"|FALSE
836|"Phoenixes in the house."|FALSE
836|"The next morning--but I am sure you would rather wait till the next"|FALSE
836|"chapter before you hear about THAT."|FALSE
836|"CHAPTER 2. THE TOPLESS TOWER"|FALSE
836|"The children had seen the Phoenix-egg hatched in the flames in their own"|FALSE
836|"nursery grate, and had heard from it how the carpet on their own nursery"|FALSE
836|"floor was really the wishing carpet, which would take them anywhere they"|FALSE
836|"chose. The carpet had transported them to bed just at the right"|FALSE
836|"moment, and the Phoenix had gone to roost on the cornice supporting the"|FALSE
836|"window-curtains of the boys' room."|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said a gentle voice, and a courteous beak opened, very"|FALSE
836|"kindly and delicately, the right eye of Cyril. 'I hear the slaves below"|FALSE
836|"preparing food. Awaken! A word of explanation and arrangement... I do"|FALSE
836|"wish you wouldn't--'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to the"|FALSE
836|"cornice-pole; for Cyril had hit out, as boys do when they are awakened"|FALSE
836|"suddenly, and the Phoenix was not used to boys, and his feelings, if not"|FALSE
836|"his wings, were hurt."|FALSE
836|"'Sorry,' said Cyril, coming awake all in a minute. 'Do come back! What"|FALSE
836|"was it you were saying? Something about bacon and rations?'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the bed."|FALSE
836|"'I say--you ARE real,' said Cyril. 'How ripping! And the carpet?'"|FALSE
836|"'The carpet is as real as it ever was,' said the Phoenix, rather"|FALSE
836|"contemptuously; 'but, of course, a carpet's only a carpet, whereas a"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix is superlatively a Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, indeed,' said Cyril, 'I see it is. Oh, what luck! Wake up, Bobs!"|FALSE
836|"There's jolly well something to wake up for today. And it's Saturday,"|FALSE
836|"too.'"|FALSE
836|"'I've been reflecting,' said the Phoenix, 'during the silent watches"|FALSE
836|"of the night, and I could not avoid the conclusion that you were quite"|FALSE
836|"insufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday. The ancients were"|FALSE
836|"always VERY surprised. Did you, by chance, EXPECT my egg to hatch?'"|FALSE
836|"'Not us,' Cyril said."|FALSE
836|"'And if we had,' said Anthea, who had come in in her nightie when she"|FALSE
836|"heard the silvery voice of the Phoenix, 'we could never, never have"|FALSE
836|"expected it to hatch anything so splendid as you.'"|FALSE
836|"The bird smiled. Perhaps you've never seen a bird smile?"|FALSE
836|"'You see,' said Anthea, wrapping herself in the boys' counterpane, for"|FALSE
836|"the morning was chill, 'we've had things happen to us before;' and she"|FALSE
836|"told the story of the Psammead, or sand-fairy."|FALSE
836|"'Ah yes,' said the Phoenix; 'Psammeads were rare, even in my time. I"|FALSE
836|"remember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert. I was always"|FALSE
836|"having compliments paid me; I can't think why.'"|FALSE
836|"'Can YOU give wishes, then?' asked Jane, who had now come in too."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, dear me, no,' said the Phoenix, contemptuously, 'at least--but I"|FALSE
836|"hear footsteps approaching. I hasten to conceal myself.' And it did."|FALSE
836|"I think I said that this day was Saturday. It was also cook's birthday,"|FALSE
836|"and mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal Palace with a"|FALSE
836|"party of friends, so Jane and Anthea of course had to help to make beds"|FALSE
836|"and to wash up the breakfast cups, and little things like that. Robert"|FALSE
836|"and Cyril intended to spend the morning in conversation with the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix, but the bird had its own ideas about this."|FALSE
836|"'I must have an hour or two's quiet,' it said, 'I really must. My nerves"|FALSE
836|"will give way unless I can get a little rest. You must remember it's two"|FALSE
836|"thousand years since I had any conversation--I'm out of practice, and I"|FALSE
836|"must take care of myself. I've often been told that mine is a valuable"|FALSE
836|"life.' So it nestled down inside an old hatbox of father's, which had"|FALSE
836|"been brought down from the box-room some days before, when a helmet was"|FALSE
836|"suddenly needed for a game of tournaments, with its golden head under"|FALSE
836|"its golden wing, and went to sleep. So then Robert and Cyril moved"|FALSE
836|"the table back and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselves"|FALSE
836|"somewhere else. But before they could decide on the place, Cyril said--"|FALSE
836|"'I don't know. Perhaps it's rather sneakish to begin without the girls.'"|FALSE
836|"'They'll be all the morning,' said Robert, impatiently. And then a thing"|FALSE
836|"inside him, which tiresome books sometimes call the 'inward monitor',"|FALSE
836|"said, 'Why don't you help them, then?'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril's 'inward monitor' happened to say the same thing at the same"|FALSE
836|"moment, so the boys went and helped to wash up the tea-cups, and to dust"|FALSE
836|"the drawing-room. Robert was so interested that he proposed to clean"|FALSE
836|"the front doorsteps--a thing he had never been allowed to do. Nor was"|FALSE
836|"he allowed to do it on this occasion. One reason was that it had already"|FALSE
836|"been done by cook."|FALSE
836|"When all the housework was finished, the girls dressed the happy,"|FALSE
836|"wriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and three-cornered hat, and"|FALSE
836|"kept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to take"|FALSE
836|"him over to granny's. Mother always went to granny's every Saturday,"|FALSE
836|"and generally some of the children went with her; but today they were to"|FALSE
836|"keep house. And their hearts were full of joyous and delightful feelings"|FALSE
836|"every time they remembered that the house they would have to keep had a"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix in it, AND a wishing carpet."|FALSE
836|"You can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time if you"|FALSE
836|"play the Noah's Ark game with him. It is quite simple. He just sits on"|FALSE
836|"your lap and tells you what animal he is, and then you say the little"|FALSE
836|"poetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be."|FALSE
836|"Of course, some of the animals, like the zebra and the tiger, haven't"|FALSE
836|"got any poetry, because they are so difficult to rhyme to. The Lamb"|FALSE
836|"knows quite well which are the poetry animals."|FALSE
836|"'I'm a baby bear!' said the Lamb, snugging down; and Anthea began:"|FALSE
836|"     'I love my little baby bear,"|FALSE
836|"     I love his nose and toes and hair;"|FALSE
836|"     I like to hold him in my arm,"|FALSE
836|"     And keep him VERY safe and warm.'"|FALSE
836|"And when she said 'very', of course there was a real bear's hug."|FALSE
836|"Then came the eel, and the Lamb was tickled till he wriggled exactly"|FALSE
836|"like a real one:"|FALSE
836|"     'I love my little baby eel,"|FALSE
836|"     He is so squidglety to feel;"|FALSE
836|"     He'll be an eel when he is big--"|FALSE
836|"     But now he's just--a--tiny SNIG!'"|FALSE
836|"Perhaps you didn't know that a snig was a baby eel? It is, though, and"|FALSE
836|"the Lamb knew it."|FALSE
836|"'Hedgehog now-!' he said; and Anthea went on:"|FALSE
836|"     'My baby hedgehog, how I like ye,"|FALSE
836|"     Though your back's so prickly-spiky;"|FALSE
836|"     Your front is very soft, I've found,"|FALSE
836|"     So I must love you front ways round!'"|FALSE
836|"And then she loved him front ways round, while he squealed with"|FALSE
836|"pleasure."|FALSE
836|"It is a very baby game, and, of course, the rhymes are only meant for"|FALSE
836|"very, very small people--not for people who are old enough to read"|FALSE
836|"books, so I won't tell you any more of them."|FALSE
836|"By the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel, and a baby"|FALSE
836|"rabbit and a baby rat, mother was ready; and she and the Lamb, having"|FALSE
836|"been kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is possible to"|FALSE
836|"be when you're dressed for out-of-doors, were seen to the tram by the"|FALSE
836|"boys. When the boys came back, every one looked at every one else and"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'Now!'"|FALSE
836|"They locked the front door and they locked the back door, and they"|FALSE
836|"fastened all the windows. They moved the table and chairs off the"|FALSE
836|"carpet, and Anthea swept it."|FALSE
836|"'We must show it a LITTLE attention,' she said kindly. 'We'll give it"|FALSE
836|"tea-leaves next time. Carpets like tea-leaves.'"|FALSE
836|"Then every one put on its out-door things, because as Cyril said, they"|FALSE
836|"didn't know where they might be going, and it makes people stare if you"|FALSE
836|"go out of doors in November in pinafores and without hats."|FALSE
836|"Then Robert gently awoke the Phoenix, who yawned and stretched itself,"|FALSE
836|"and allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the carpet, where it"|FALSE
836|"instantly went to sleep again with its crested head tucked under its"|FALSE
836|"golden wing as before. Then every one sat down on the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Where shall we go?' was of course the question, and it was warmly"|FALSE
836|"discussed. Anthea wanted to go to Japan. Robert and Cyril voted for"|FALSE
836|"America, and Jane wished to go to the seaside."|FALSE
836|"'Because there are donkeys there,' said she."|FALSE
836|"'Not in November, silly,' said Cyril; and the discussion got warmer and"|FALSE
836|"warmer, and still nothing was settled."|FALSE
836|"'I vote we let the Phoenix decide,' said Robert, at last. So they"|FALSE
836|"stroked it till it woke. 'We want to go somewhere abroad,' they said,"|FALSE
836|"'and we can't make up our minds where.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let the carpet make up ITS mind, if it has one,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Just say you wish to go abroad.'"|FALSE
836|"So they did; and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside down,"|FALSE
836|"and when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy enough to look"|FALSE
836|"about them, they were out of doors."|FALSE
836|"Out of doors--this is a feeble way to express where they were. They"|FALSE
836|"were out of--out of the earth, or off it. In fact, they were floating"|FALSE
836|"steadily, safely, splendidly, in the crisp clear air, with the pale"|FALSE
836|"bright blue of the sky above them, and far down below the pale bright"|FALSE
836|"sun-diamonded waves of the sea. The carpet had stiffened itself somehow,"|FALSE
836|"so that it was square and firm like a raft, and it steered itself so"|FALSE
836|"beautifully and kept on its way so flat and fearless that no one was at"|FALSE
836|"all afraid of tumbling off. In front of them lay land."|FALSE
836|"'The coast of France,' said the Phoenix, waking up and pointing with"|FALSE
836|"its wing. 'Where do you wish to go? I should always keep one wish, of"|FALSE
836|"course--for emergencies--otherwise you may get into an emergency from"|FALSE
836|"which you can't emerge at all.'"|FALSE
836|"But the children were far too deeply interested to listen."|FALSE
836|"'I tell you what,' said Cyril: 'let's let the thing go on and on, and"|FALSE
836|"when we see a place we really want to stop at--why, we'll just stop."|FALSE
836|"Isn't this ripping?'"|FALSE
836|"'It's like trains,' said Anthea, as they swept over the low-lying"|FALSE
836|"coast-line and held a steady course above orderly fields and straight"|FALSE
836|"roads bordered with poplar trees--'like express trains, only in trains"|FALSE
836|"you never can see anything because of grown-ups wanting the windows"|FALSE
836|"shut; and then they breathe on them, and it's like ground glass, and"|FALSE
836|"nobody can see anything, and then they go to sleep.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's like tobogganing,' said Robert, 'so fast and smooth, only there's"|FALSE
836|"no door-mat to stop short on--it goes on and on.'"|FALSE
836|"'You darling Phoenix,' said Jane, 'it's all your doing. Oh, look at"|FALSE
836|"that ducky little church and the women with flappy cappy things on their"|FALSE
836|"heads.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't mention it,' said the Phoenix, with sleepy politeness."|FALSE
836|"'OH!' said Cyril, summing up all the rapture that was in every heart."|FALSE
836|"'Look at it all--look at it--and think of the Kentish Town Road!'"|FALSE
836|"Every one looked and every one thought. And the glorious, gliding,"|FALSE
836|"smooth, steady rush went on, and they looked down on strange and"|FALSE
836|"beautiful things, and held their breath and let it go in deep sighs, and"|FALSE
836|"said 'Oh!' and 'Ah!' till it was long past dinner-time."|FALSE
836|"It was Jane who suddenly said, 'I wish we'd brought that jam tart and"|FALSE
836|"cold mutton with us. It would have been jolly to have a picnic in the"|FALSE
836|"air.'"|FALSE
836|"The jam tart and cold mutton were, however, far away, sitting quietly in"|FALSE
836|"the larder of the house in Camden Town which the children were supposed"|FALSE
836|"to be keeping. A mouse was at that moment tasting the outside of the"|FALSE
836|"raspberry jam part of the tart (she had nibbled a sort of gulf, or bay,"|FALSE
836|"through the pastry edge) to see whether it was the sort of dinner she"|FALSE
836|"could ask her little mouse-husband to sit down to. She had had a very"|FALSE
836|"good dinner herself. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good."|FALSE
836|"'We'll stop as soon as we see a nice place,' said Anthea. 'I've got"|FALSE
836|"threepence, and you boys have the fourpence each that your trams didn't"|FALSE
836|"cost the other day, so we can buy things to eat. I expect the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"can speak French.'"|FALSE
836|"The carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and towns"|FALSE
836|"and farms and fields. It reminded everybody of a certain time when all"|FALSE
836|"of them had had wings, and had flown up to the top of a church tower,"|FALSE
836|"and had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and new bread and"|FALSE
836|"soda-water. And this again reminded them how hungry they were. And just"|FALSE
836|"as they were all being reminded of this very strongly indeed, they saw"|FALSE
836|"ahead of them some ruined walls on a hill, and strong and upright, and"|FALSE
836|"really, to look at, as good as new--a great square tower."|FALSE
836|"'The top of that's just the exactly same size as the carpet,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'_I_ think it would be good to go to the top of that, because then none"|FALSE
836|"of the Abby-what's-its-names--I mean natives--would be able to take the"|FALSE
836|"carpet away even if they wanted to. And some of us could go out and get"|FALSE
836|"things to eat--buy them honestly, I mean, not take them out of larder"|FALSE
836|"windows.'"|FALSE
836|"'I think it would be better if we went--' Anthea was beginning; but Jane"|FALSE
836|"suddenly clenched her hands."|FALSE
836|"'I don't see why I should never do anything I want, just because I'm"|FALSE
836|"the youngest. I wish the carpet would fit itself in at the top of that"|FALSE
836|"tower--so there!'"|FALSE
836|"The carpet made a disconcerting bound, and next moment it was hovering"|FALSE
836|"above the square top of the tower. Then slowly and carefully it began to"|FALSE
836|"sink under them. It was like a lift going down with you at the Army and"|FALSE
836|"Navy Stores."|FALSE
836|"'I don't think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to them"|FALSE
836|"first,' said Robert, huffishly. 'Hullo! What on earth?'"|FALSE
836|"For unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the four"|FALSE
836|"sides of the carpet. It was as if a wall were being built by magic"|FALSE
836|"quickness. It was a foot high--it was two feet high--three, four, five."|FALSE
836|"It was shutting out the light--more and more."|FALSE
836|"Anthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet above"|FALSE
836|"them."|FALSE
836|"'We're dropping into the tower,' she screamed. 'THERE WASN'T ANY TOP TO"|FALSE
836|"IT. So the carpet's going to fit itself in at the bottom.'"|FALSE
836|"Robert sprang to his feet."|FALSE
836|"'We ought to have--Hullo! an owl's nest.' He put his knee on a jutting"|FALSE
836|"smooth piece of grey stone, and reached his hand into a deep window"|FALSE
836|"slit--broad to the inside of the tower, and narrowing like a funnel to"|FALSE
836|"the outside."|FALSE
836|"'Look sharp!' cried every one, but Robert did not look sharp enough. By"|FALSE
836|"the time he had drawn his hand out of the owl's nest--there were no eggs"|FALSE
836|"there--the carpet had sunk eight feet below him."|FALSE
836|"'Jump, you silly cuckoo!' cried Cyril, with brotherly anxiety."|FALSE
836|"But Robert couldn't turn round all in a minute into a jumping position."|FALSE
836|"He wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge, and by the time"|FALSE
836|"he was ready to jump the walls of the tower had risen up thirty feet"|FALSE
836|"above the others, who were still sinking with the carpet, and Robert"|FALSE
836|"found himself in the embrasure of a window; alone, for even the owls"|FALSE
836|"were not at home that day. The wall was smoothish; there was no climbing"|FALSE
836|"up, and as for climbing down--Robert hid his face in his hands, and"|FALSE
836|"squirmed back and back from the giddy verge, until the back part of him"|FALSE
836|"was wedged quite tight in the narrowest part of the window slit."|FALSE
836|"He was safe now, of course, but the outside part of his window was like"|FALSE
836|"a frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower. It was very"|FALSE
836|"pretty, with moss growing between the stones and little shiny gems; but"|FALSE
836|"between him and it there was the width of the tower, and nothing in it"|FALSE
836|"but empty air. The situation was terrible. Robert saw in a flash that"|FALSE
836|"the carpet was likely to bring them into just the same sort of tight"|FALSE
836|"places that they used to get into with the wishes the Psammead granted"|FALSE
836|"them."|FALSE
836|"And the others--imagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly and"|FALSE
836|"steadily to the very bottom of the tower, leaving Robert clinging to the"|FALSE
836|"wall. Robert did not even try to imagine their feelings--he had quite"|FALSE
836|"enough to do with his own; but you can."|FALSE
836|"As soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of the"|FALSE
836|"inside of the tower it suddenly lost that raft-like stiffness which had"|FALSE
836|"been such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town to the topless"|FALSE
836|"tower, and spread itself limply over the loose stones and little earthy"|FALSE
836|"mounds at the bottom of the tower, just exactly like any ordinary"|FALSE
836|"carpet. Also it shrank suddenly, so that it seemed to draw away from"|FALSE
836|"under their feet, and they stepped quickly off the edges and stood on"|FALSE
836|"the firm ground, while the carpet drew itself in till it was its proper"|FALSE
836|"size, and no longer fitted exactly into the inside of the tower, but"|FALSE
836|"left quite a big space all round it."|FALSE
836|"Then across the carpet they looked at each other, and then every chin"|FALSE
836|"was tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor Robert had"|FALSE
836|"got to. Of course, they couldn't see him."|FALSE
836|"'I wish we hadn't come,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'You always do,' said Cyril, briefly. 'Look here, we can't leave Robert"|FALSE
836|"up there. I wish the carpet would fetch him down.'"|FALSE
836|"The carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together. It"|FALSE
836|"stiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls of the"|FALSE
836|"tower. The children below craned their heads back, and nearly broke"|FALSE
836|"their necks in doing it. The carpet rose and rose. It hung poised darkly"|FALSE
836|"above them for an anxious moment or two; then it dropped down again,"|FALSE
836|"threw itself on the uneven floor of the tower, and as it did so it"|FALSE
836|"tumbled Robert out on the uneven floor of the tower."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, glory!' said Robert, 'that was a squeak. You don't know how I felt."|FALSE
836|"I say, I've had about enough for a bit. Let's wish ourselves at home"|FALSE
836|"again and have a go at that jam tart and mutton. We can go out again"|FALSE
836|"afterwards.'"|FALSE
836|"'Righto!' said every one, for the adventure had shaken the nerves of"|FALSE
836|"all. So they all got on to the carpet again, and said--"|FALSE
836|"'I wish we were at home.'"|FALSE
836|"And lo and behold, they were no more at home than before. The carpet"|FALSE
836|"never moved. The Phoenix had taken the opportunity to go to sleep."|FALSE
836|"Anthea woke it up gently."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' she said."|FALSE
836|"'I'm looking,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'We WISHED to be at home, and we're still here,' complained Jane."|FALSE
836|"'No,' said the Phoenix, looking about it at the high dark walls of the"|FALSE
836|"tower. 'No; I quite see that.'"|FALSE
836|"'But we wished to be at home,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'No doubt,' said the bird, politely."|FALSE
836|"'And the carpet hasn't moved an inch,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'No,' said the Phoenix, 'I see it hasn't.'"|FALSE
836|"'But I thought it was a wishing carpet?'"|FALSE
836|"'So it is,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Then why--?' asked the children, altogether."|FALSE
836|"'I did tell you, you know,' said the Phoenix, 'only you are so fond"|FALSE
836|"of listening to the music of your own voices. It is, indeed, the most"|FALSE
836|"lovely music to each of us, and therefore--'"|FALSE
836|"'You did tell us WHAT?' interrupted an Exasperated."|FALSE
836|"'Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU'VE HAD"|FALSE
836|"THEM.'"|FALSE
836|"There was a heartfelt silence."|FALSE
836|"'Then how are we going to get home?' said Cyril, at last."|FALSE
836|"'I haven't any idea,' replied the Phoenix, kindly. 'Can I fly out and"|FALSE
836|"get you any little thing?'"|FALSE
836|"'How could you carry the money to pay for it?'"|FALSE
836|"'It isn't necessary. Birds always take what they want. It is not"|FALSE
836|"regarded as stealing, except in the case of magpies.'"|FALSE
836|"The children were glad to find they had been right in supposing this to"|FALSE
836|"be the case, on the day when they had wings, and had enjoyed somebody"|FALSE
836|"else's ripe plums."|FALSE
836|"'Yes; let the Phoenix get us something to eat, anyway,' Robert urged--'"|FALSE
836|"('If it will be so kind you mean,' corrected Anthea, in a whisper); 'if"|FALSE
836|"it will be so kind, and we can be thinking while it's gone.'"|FALSE
836|"So the Phoenix fluttered up through the grey space of the tower and"|FALSE
836|"vanished at the top, and it was not till it had quite gone that Jane"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'Suppose it never comes back.'"|FALSE
836|"It was not a pleasant thought, and though Anthea at once said, 'Of"|FALSE
836|"course it will come back; I'm certain it's a bird of its word,' a"|FALSE
836|"further gloom was cast by the idea. For, curiously enough, there was"|FALSE
836|"no door to the tower, and all the windows were far, far too high to be"|FALSE
836|"reached by the most adventurous climber. It was cold, too, and Anthea"|FALSE
836|"shivered."|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Cyril, 'it's like being at the bottom of a well.'"|FALSE
836|"The children waited in a sad and hungry silence, and got little stiff"|FALSE
836|"necks with holding their little heads back to look up the inside of the"|FALSE
836|"tall grey tower, to see if the Phoenix were coming."|FALSE
836|"At last it came. It looked very big as it fluttered down between the"|FALSE
836|"walls, and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness was"|FALSE
836|"caused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one claw."|FALSE
836|"In the other it held a piece of bread. And in its beak was a very large"|FALSE
836|"pear. The pear was juicy, and as good as a very small drink. When the"|FALSE
836|"meal was over every one felt better, and the question of how to get home"|FALSE
836|"was discussed without any disagreeableness. But no one could think"|FALSE
836|"of any way out of the difficulty, or even out of the tower; for the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix, though its beak and claws had fortunately been strong enough"|FALSE
836|"to carry food for them, was plainly not equal to flying through the air"|FALSE
836|"with four well-nourished children."|FALSE
836|"'We must stay here, I suppose,' said Robert at last, 'and shout out"|FALSE
836|"every now and then, and some one will hear us and bring ropes and"|FALSE
836|"ladders, and rescue us like out of mines; and they'll get up a"|FALSE
836|"subscription to send us home, like castaways.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes; but we shan't be home before mother is, and then father'll take"|FALSE
836|"away the carpet and say it's dangerous or something,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'I DO wish we hadn't come,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"And every one else said 'Shut up,' except Anthea, who suddenly awoke the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix and said--"|FALSE
836|"'Look here, I believe YOU can help us. Oh, I do wish you would!'"|FALSE
836|"'I will help you as far as lies in my power,' said the Phoenix, at once."|FALSE
836|"'What is it you want now?'"|FALSE
836|"'Why, we want to get home,' said every one."|FALSE
836|"'Oh,' said the Phoenix. 'Ah, hum! Yes. Home, you said? Meaning?'"|FALSE
836|"'Where we live--where we slept last night--where the altar is that your"|FALSE
836|"egg was hatched on.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, there!' said the Phoenix. 'Well, I'll do my best.' It fluttered on"|FALSE
836|"to the carpet and walked up and down for a few minutes in deep thought."|FALSE
836|"Then it drew itself up proudly."|FALSE
836|"'I CAN help you,' it said. 'I am almost sure I can help you. Unless I"|FALSE
836|"am grossly deceived I can help you. You won't mind my leaving you for an"|FALSE
836|"hour or two?' and without waiting for a reply it soared up through the"|FALSE
836|"dimness of the tower into the brightness above."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' said Cyril, firmly, 'it said an hour or two. But I've read"|FALSE
836|"about captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and things"|FALSE
836|"awaiting release, and I know each moment is an eternity. Those people"|FALSE
836|"always do something to pass the desperate moments. It's no use our"|FALSE
836|"trying to tame spiders, because we shan't have time.'"|FALSE
836|"'I HOPE not,' said Jane, doubtfully."|FALSE
836|"'But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something.'"|FALSE
836|"'I say, talking of stones,' said Robert, 'you see that heap of stones"|FALSE
836|"against the wall over in that corner. Well, I'm certain there's a hole"|FALSE
836|"in the wall there--and I believe it's a door. Yes, look here--the stones"|FALSE
836|"are round like an arch in the wall; and here's the hole--it's all black"|FALSE
836|"inside.'"|FALSE
836|"He had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up to"|FALSE
836|"it--dislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little dark"|FALSE
836|"space."|FALSE
836|"Next moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones, and"|FALSE
836|"very soon every one threw off its jacket, for it was warm work."|FALSE
836|"'It IS a door,' said Cyril, wiping his face, 'and not a bad thing"|FALSE
836|"either, if--'"|FALSE
836|"He was going to add 'if anything happens to the Phoenix,' but he didn't"|FALSE
836|"for fear of frightening Jane. He was not an unkind boy when he had"|FALSE
836|"leisure to think of such things."|FALSE
836|"The arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger. It was very, very"|FALSE
836|"black, even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom of the"|FALSE
836|"tower; it grew larger because the children kept pulling off the stones"|FALSE
836|"and throwing them down into another heap. The stones must have been"|FALSE
836|"there a very long time, for they were covered with moss, and some of"|FALSE
836|"them were stuck together by it. So it was fairly hard work, as Robert"|FALSE
836|"pointed out."|FALSE
836|"When the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the arch"|FALSE
836|"and the tower, Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on the"|FALSE
836|"inside, and lit matches. How thankful they felt then that they had a"|FALSE
836|"sensible father, who did not forbid them to carry matches, as some boys'"|FALSE
836|"fathers do. The father of Robert and Cyril only insisted on the matches"|FALSE
836|"being of the kind that strike only on the box."|FALSE
836|"'It's not a door, it's a sort of tunnel,' Robert cried to the girls,"|FALSE
836|"after the first match had flared up, flickered, and gone out. 'Stand"|FALSE
836|"off--we'll push some more stones down!'"|FALSE
836|"They did, amid deep excitement. And now the stone heap was almost"|FALSE
836|"gone--and before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to unknown"|FALSE
836|"things. All doubts and fears as to getting home were forgotten in this"|FALSE
836|"thrilling moment. It was like Monte Cristo--it was like--"|FALSE
836|"'I say,' cried Anthea, suddenly, 'come out! There's always bad air in"|FALSE
836|"places that have been shut up. It makes your torches go out, and then"|FALSE
836|"you die. It's called fire-damp, I believe. Come out, I tell you.'"|FALSE
836|"The urgency of her tone actually brought the boys out--and then every"|FALSE
836|"one took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it, so as to"|FALSE
836|"make the air fresh inside. When Anthea thought the air inside 'must be"|FALSE
836|"freshened by now,' Cyril led the way into the arch."|FALSE
836|"The girls followed, and Robert came last, because Jane refused to tail"|FALSE
836|"the procession lest 'something' should come in after her, and catch at"|FALSE
836|"her from behind. Cyril advanced cautiously, lighting match after match,"|FALSE
836|"and peering before him."|FALSE
836|"'It's a vaulting roof,' he said, 'and it's all stone--all right,"|FALSE
836|"Panther, don't keep pulling at my jacket! The air must be all right"|FALSE
836|"because of the matches, silly, and there are--look out--there are steps"|FALSE
836|"down.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, don't let's go any farther,' said Jane, in an agony of reluctance"|FALSE
836|"(a very painful thing, by the way, to be in). 'I'm sure there are"|FALSE
836|"snakes, or dens of lions, or something. Do let's go back, and come some"|FALSE
836|"other time, with candles, and bellows for the fire-damp.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let me get in front of you, then,' said the stern voice of Robert, from"|FALSE
836|"behind. 'This is exactly the place for buried treasure, and I'm going"|FALSE
836|"on, anyway; you can stay behind if you like.'"|FALSE
836|"And then, of course, Jane consented to go on."|FALSE
836|"So, very slowly and carefully, the children went down the steps--there"|FALSE
836|"were seventeen of them--and at the bottom of the steps were more"|FALSE
836|"passages branching four ways, and a sort of low arch on the right-hand"|FALSE
836|"side made Cyril wonder what it could be, for it was too low to be the"|FALSE
836|"beginning of another passage."|FALSE
836|"So he knelt down and lit a match, and stooping very low he peeped in."|FALSE
836|"'There's SOMETHING,' he said, and reached out his hand. It touched"|FALSE
836|"something that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything else"|FALSE
836|"that Cyril had ever touched."|FALSE
836|"'I believe it IS a buried treasure,' he cried."|FALSE
836|"And it was; for even as Anthea cried, 'Oh, hurry up, Squirrel--fetch it"|FALSE
836|"out!' Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas bag--about as big as the paper"|FALSE
836|"ones the greengrocer gives you with Barcelona nuts in for sixpence."|FALSE
836|"'There's more of it, a lot more,' he said."|FALSE
836|"As he pulled the rotten bag gave way, and the gold coins ran and span"|FALSE
836|"and jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of the dark"|FALSE
836|"passage."|FALSE
836|"I wonder what you would say if you suddenly came upon a buried treasure?"|FALSE
836|"What Cyril said was, 'Oh, bother--I've burnt my fingers!' and as he"|FALSE
836|"spoke he dropped the match. 'AND IT WAS THE LAST!' he added."|FALSE
836|"There was a moment of desperate silence. Then Jane began to cry."|FALSE
836|"'Don't,' said Anthea, 'don't, Pussy--you'll exhaust the air if you cry."|FALSE
836|"We can get out all right.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Jane, through her sobs, 'and find the Phoenix has come back"|FALSE
836|"and gone away again--because it thought we'd gone home some other way,"|FALSE
836|"and--Oh, I WISH we hadn't come.'"|FALSE
836|"Every one stood quite still--only Anthea cuddled Jane up to her and"|FALSE
836|"tried to wipe her eyes in the dark."|FALSE
836|"'D-DON'T,' said Jane; 'that's my EAR--I'm not crying with my ears.'"|FALSE
836|"'Come, let's get on out,' said Robert; but that was not so easy, for no"|FALSE
836|"one could remember exactly which way they had come. It is very difficult"|FALSE
836|"to remember things in the dark, unless you have matches with you, and"|FALSE
836|"then of course it is quite different, even if you don't strike one."|FALSE
836|"Every one had come to agree with Jane's constant wish--and despair was"|FALSE
836|"making the darkness blacker than ever, when quite suddenly the floor"|FALSE
836|"seemed to tip up--and a strong sensation of being in a whirling lift"|FALSE
836|"came upon every one. All eyes were closed--one's eyes always are in the"|FALSE
836|"dark, don't you think? When the whirling feeling stopped, Cyril said"|FALSE
836|"'Earthquakes!' and they all opened their eyes."|FALSE
836|"They were in their own dingy breakfast-room at home, and oh, how light"|FALSE
836|"and bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it seemed"|FALSE
836|"after that dark underground tunnel! The carpet lay on the floor, looking"|FALSE
836|"as calm as though it had never been for an excursion in its life. On"|FALSE
836|"the mantelpiece stood the Phoenix, waiting with an air of modest yet"|FALSE
836|"sterling worth for the thanks of the children."|FALSE
836|"'But how DID you do it?' they asked, when every one had thanked the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix again and again."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead.'"|FALSE
836|"'But how DID you know where to find it?'"|FALSE
836|"'I found that out from the carpet; these wishing creatures always know"|FALSE
836|"all about each other--they're so clannish; like the Scots, you know--all"|FALSE
836|"related.'"|FALSE
836|"'But, the carpet can't talk, can it?'"|FALSE
836|"'No.'"|FALSE
836|"'Then how--'"|FALSE
836|"'How did I get the Psammead's address? I tell you I got it from the"|FALSE
836|"carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'DID it speak then?'"|FALSE
836|"'No,' said the Phoenix, thoughtfully, 'it didn't speak, but I gathered"|FALSE
836|"my information from something in its manner. I was always a singularly"|FALSE
836|"observant bird.'"|FALSE
836|"It was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart, as well as the"|FALSE
836|"tea and bread-and-butter, that any one found time to regret the golden"|FALSE
836|"treasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the underground"|FALSE
836|"passage, and which, indeed, no one had thought of till now, since the"|FALSE
836|"moment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of the last match."|FALSE
836|"'What owls and goats we were!' said Robert. 'Look how we've always"|FALSE
836|"wanted treasure--and now--'"|FALSE
836|"'Never mind,' said Anthea, trying as usual to make the best of it."|FALSE
836|"'We'll go back again and get it all, and then we'll give everybody"|FALSE
836|"presents.'"|FALSE
836|"More than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging what"|FALSE
836|"presents should be given to whom, and, when the claims of generosity had"|FALSE
836|"been satisfied, the talk ran for fifty minutes on what they would buy"|FALSE
836|"for themselves."|FALSE
836|"It was Cyril who broke in on Robert's almost too technical account of"|FALSE
836|"the motor-car on which he meant to go to and from school--"|FALSE
836|"'There!' he said. 'Dry up. It's no good. We can't ever go back. We don't"|FALSE
836|"know where it is.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't YOU know?' Jane asked the Phoenix, wistfully."|FALSE
836|"'Not in the least,' the Phoenix replied, in a tone of amiable regret."|FALSE
836|"'Then we've lost the treasure,' said Cyril. And they had."|FALSE
836|"'But we've got the carpet and the Phoenix,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said the bird, with an air of wounded dignity, 'I do SO"|FALSE
836|"HATE to seem to interfere, but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix and the"|FALSE
836|"carpet?'"|FALSE
836|"CHAPTER 3. THE QUEEN COOK"|FALSE
836|"It was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious journey"|FALSE
836|"on the wishing carpet. Unless you are too young to read at all, you will"|FALSE
836|"know that the next day must have been Sunday."|FALSE
836|"Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, was always a very pretty"|FALSE
836|"day. Father always brought home flowers on Saturday, so that the"|FALSE
836|"breakfast-table was extra beautiful. In November, of course, the flowers"|FALSE
836|"were chrysanthemums, yellow and coppery coloured. Then there were always"|FALSE
836|"sausages on toast for breakfast, and these are rapture, after six days"|FALSE
836|"of Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a shilling."|FALSE
836|"On this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner, a kind of food"|FALSE
836|"that is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions, and there"|FALSE
836|"was an angel pudding, when rice and milk and oranges and white icing do"|FALSE
836|"their best to make you happy."|FALSE
836|"After dinner father was very sleepy indeed, because he had been working"|FALSE
836|"hard all the week; but he did not yield to the voice that said, 'Go and"|FALSE
836|"have an hour's rest.' He nursed the Lamb, who had a horrid cough that"|FALSE
836|"cook said was whooping-cough as sure as eggs, and he said--"|FALSE
836|"'Come along, kiddies; I've got a ripping book from the library, called"|FALSE
836|"The Golden Age, and I'll read it to you.'"|FALSE
836|"Mother settled herself on the drawing-room sofa, and said she could"|FALSE
836|"listen quite nicely with her eyes shut. The Lamb snugged into the"|FALSE
836|"'armchair corner' of daddy's arm, and the others got into a happy heap"|FALSE
836|"on the hearth-rug. At first, of course, there were too many feet and"|FALSE
836|"knees and shoulders and elbows, but real comfort was actually settling"|FALSE
836|"down on them, and the Phoenix and the carpet were put away on the back"|FALSE
836|"top shelf of their minds (beautiful things that could be taken out and"|FALSE
836|"played with later), when a surly solid knock came at the drawing-room"|FALSE
836|"door. It opened an angry inch, and the cook's voice said, 'Please, m',"|FALSE
836|"may I speak to you a moment?'"|FALSE
836|"Mother looked at father with a desperate expression. Then she put her"|FALSE
836|"pretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa, and stood up in them and"|FALSE
836|"sighed."|FALSE
836|"'As good fish in the sea,' said father, cheerfully, and it was not till"|FALSE
836|"much later that the children understood what he meant."|FALSE
836|"Mother went out into the passage, which is called 'the hall', where the"|FALSE
836|"umbrella-stand is, and the picture of the 'Monarch of the Glen' in a"|FALSE
836|"yellow shining frame, with brown spots on the Monarch from the damp"|FALSE
836|"in the house before last, and there was cook, very red and damp in the"|FALSE
836|"face, and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over the dirty one that"|FALSE
836|"she had dished up those dear delightful chickens in. She stood there and"|FALSE
836|"she seemed to get redder and damper, and she twisted the corner of her"|FALSE
836|"apron round her fingers, and she said very shortly and fiercely--"|FALSE
836|"'If you please ma'am, I should wish to leave at my day month.' Mother"|FALSE
836|"leaned against the hatstand. The children could see her looking pale"|FALSE
836|"through the crack of the door, because she had been very kind to the"|FALSE
836|"cook, and had given her a holiday only the day before, and it seemed so"|FALSE
836|"very unkind of the cook to want to go like this, and on a Sunday too."|FALSE
836|"'Why, what's the matter?' mother said."|FALSE
836|"'It's them children,' the cook replied, and somehow the children all"|FALSE
836|"felt that they had known it from the first. They did not remember having"|FALSE
836|"done anything extra wrong, but it is so frightfully easy to displease a"|FALSE
836|"cook. 'It's them children: there's that there new carpet in their room,"|FALSE
836|"covered thick with mud, both sides, beastly yellow mud, and sakes alive"|FALSE
836|"knows where they got it. And all that muck to clean up on a Sunday! It's"|FALSE
836|"not my place, and it's not my intentions, so I don't deceive you, ma'am,"|FALSE
836|"and but for them limbs, which they is if ever there was, it's not a bad"|FALSE
836|"place, though I says it, and I wouldn't wish to leave, but--'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm very sorry,' said mother, gently. 'I will speak to the children."|FALSE
836|"And you had better think it over, and if you REALLY wish to go, tell me"|FALSE
836|"to-morrow.'"|FALSE
836|"Next day mother had a quiet talk with cook, and cook said she didn't"|FALSE
836|"mind if she stayed on a bit, just to see."|FALSE
836|"But meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone into"|FALSE
836|"thoroughly by father and mother. Jane's candid explanation that the"|FALSE
836|"mud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was buried"|FALSE
836|"treasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the others"|FALSE
836|"limited their defence to an expression of sorrow, and of a determination"|FALSE
836|"'not to do it again'. But father said (and mother agreed with him,"|FALSE
836|"because mothers have to agree with fathers, and not because it was her"|FALSE
836|"own idea) that children who coated a carpet on both sides with thick"|FALSE
836|"mud, and when they were asked for an explanation could only talk silly"|FALSE
836|"nonsense--that meant Jane's truthful statement--were not fit to have a"|FALSE
836|"carpet at all, and, indeed, SHOULDN'T have one for a week!"|FALSE
836|"So the carpet was brushed (with tea-leaves, too) which was the only"|FALSE
836|"comfort Anthea could think of, and folded up and put away in the"|FALSE
836|"cupboard at the top of the stairs, and daddy put the key in his trousers"|FALSE
836|"pocket. 'Till Saturday,' said he."|FALSE
836|"'Never mind,' said Anthea, 'we've got the Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"But, as it happened, they hadn't. The Phoenix was nowhere to be found,"|FALSE
836|"and everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild beauty of"|FALSE
836|"magic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary November life"|FALSE
836|"in Camden Town--and there was the nursery floor all bare boards in"|FALSE
836|"the middle and brown oilcloth round the outside, and the bareness and"|FALSE
836|"yellowness of the middle floor showed up the blackbeetles with terrible"|FALSE
836|"distinctness, when the poor things came out in the evening, as usual, to"|FALSE
836|"try to make friends with the children. But the children never would."|FALSE
836|"The Sunday ended in gloom, which even junket for supper in the blue"|FALSE
836|"Dresden bowl could hardly lighten at all. Next day the Lamb's cough"|FALSE
836|"was worse. It certainly seemed very whoopy, and the doctor came in his"|FALSE
836|"brougham carriage."|FALSE
836|"Every one tried to bear up under the weight of the sorrow which it was"|FALSE
836|"to know that the wishing carpet was locked up and the Phoenix mislaid. A"|FALSE
836|"good deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'It's a bird of its word,' said Anthea. 'I'm sure it's not deserted us."|FALSE
836|"But you know it had a most awfully long fly from wherever it was to near"|FALSE
836|"Rochester and back, and I expect the poor thing's feeling tired out and"|FALSE
836|"wants rest. I am sure we may trust it.'"|FALSE
836|"The others tried to feel sure of this, too, but it was hard."|FALSE
836|"No one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook, since it"|FALSE
836|"was entirely through her making such a fuss about a little foreign mud"|FALSE
836|"that the carpet had been taken away."|FALSE
836|"'She might have told us,' said Jane, 'and Panther and I would have"|FALSE
836|"cleaned it with tea-leaves.'"|FALSE
836|"'She's a cantankerous cat,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'I shan't say what I think about her,' said Anthea, primly, 'because it"|FALSE
836|"would be evil speaking, lying, and slandering.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not lying to say she's a disagreeable pig, and a beastly"|FALSE
836|"blue-nosed Bozwoz,' said Cyril, who had read The Eyes of Light, and"|FALSE
836|"intended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk like"|FALSE
836|"Paul."|FALSE
836|"And all the children, even Anthea, agreed that even if she wasn't a"|FALSE
836|"blue-nosed Bozwoz, they wished cook had never been born."|FALSE
836|"But I ask you to believe that they didn't do all the things on purpose"|FALSE
836|"which so annoyed the cook during the following week, though I daresay"|FALSE
836|"the things would not have happened if the cook had been a favourite."|FALSE
836|"This is a mystery. Explain it if you can. The things that had happened"|FALSE
836|"were as follows:"|FALSE
836|"Sunday.--Discovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet."|FALSE
836|"Monday.--Liquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan."|FALSE
836|"Anthea did this, because she thought it would be good for the Lamb's"|FALSE
836|"cough. The whole thing forgotten, and bottom of saucepan burned out. It"|FALSE
836|"was the little saucepan lined with white that was kept for the baby's"|FALSE
836|"milk."|FALSE
836|"Tuesday.--A dead mouse found in pantry. Fish-slice taken to dig grave"|FALSE
836|"with. By regrettable accident fish-slice broken. Defence: 'The cook"|FALSE
836|"oughtn't to keep dead mice in pantries.'"|FALSE
836|"Wednesday.--Chopped suet left on kitchen table. Robert added chopped"|FALSE
836|"soap, but he says he thought the suet was soap too."|FALSE
836|"Thursday.--Broke the kitchen window by falling against it during a"|FALSE
836|"perfectly fair game of bandits in the area."|FALSE
836|"Friday.--Stopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled sink"|FALSE
836|"with water to make a lake to sail paper boats in. Went away and left the"|FALSE
836|"tap running. Kitchen hearthrug and cook's shoes ruined."|FALSE
836|"On Saturday the carpet was restored. There had been plenty of time"|FALSE
836|"during the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they did"|FALSE
836|"get it back."|FALSE
836|"Mother had gone over to granny's, and had not taken the Lamb because he"|FALSE
836|"had a bad cough, which, cook repeatedly said, was whooping-cough as sure"|FALSE
836|"as eggs is eggs."|FALSE
836|"'But we'll take him out, a ducky darling,' said Anthea. 'We'll take"|FALSE
836|"him somewhere where you can't have whooping-cough. Don't be so silly,"|FALSE
836|"Robert. If he DOES talk about it no one'll take any notice. He's always"|FALSE
836|"talking about things he's never seen.'"|FALSE
836|"So they dressed the Lamb and themselves in out-of-doors clothes, and the"|FALSE
836|"Lamb chuckled and coughed, and laughed and coughed again, poor dear, and"|FALSE
836|"all the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet by the boys, while"|FALSE
836|"Jane nursed the Lamb, and Anthea rushed through the house in one last"|FALSE
836|"wild hunt for the missing Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'It's no use waiting for it,' she said, reappearing breathless in the"|FALSE
836|"breakfast-room. 'But I know it hasn't deserted us. It's a bird of its"|FALSE
836|"word.'"|FALSE
836|"'Quite so,' said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the table."|FALSE
836|"Every one fell on its knees and looked up, and there was the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"perched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the table, and had"|FALSE
836|"once supported a drawer, in the happy days before the drawer had been"|FALSE
836|"used as a boat, and its bottom unfortunately trodden out by Raggett's"|FALSE
836|"Really Reliable School Boots on the feet of Robert."|FALSE
836|"'I've been here all the time,' said the Phoenix, yawning politely"|FALSE
836|"behind its claw. 'If you wanted me you should have recited the ode of"|FALSE
836|"invocation; it's seven thousand lines long, and written in very pure and"|FALSE
836|"beautiful Greek.'"|FALSE
836|"'Couldn't you tell it us in English?' asked Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'It's rather long, isn't it?' said Jane, jumping the Lamb on her knee."|FALSE
836|"'Couldn't you make a short English version, like Tate and Brady?'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, come along, do,' said Robert, holding out his hand. 'Come along,"|FALSE
836|"good old Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix,' it corrected shyly."|FALSE
836|"'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix, then. Come along, come along,' said Robert,"|FALSE
836|"impatiently, with his hand still held out."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist."|FALSE
836|"'This amiable youth,' it said to the others, 'has miraculously been able"|FALSE
836|"to put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek invocation"|FALSE
836|"into one English hexameter--a little misplaced some of the words--but--"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, come along, come along, good old beautiful Phoenix!'"|FALSE
836|"'Not perfect, I admit--but not bad for a boy of his age.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, now then,' said Robert, stepping back on to the carpet with the"|FALSE
836|"golden Phoenix on his wrist."|FALSE
836|"'You look like the king's falconer,' said Jane, sitting down on the"|FALSE
836|"carpet with the baby on her lap."|FALSE
836|"Robert tried to go on looking like it. Cyril and Anthea stood on the"|FALSE
836|"carpet."|FALSE
836|"'We shall have to get back before dinner,' said Cyril, 'or cook will"|FALSE
836|"blow the gaff.'"|FALSE
836|"'She hasn't sneaked since Sunday,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'She--' Robert was beginning, when the door burst open and the cook,"|FALSE
836|"fierce and furious, came in like a whirlwind and stood on the corner of"|FALSE
836|"the carpet, with a broken basin in one hand and a threat in the other,"|FALSE
836|"which was clenched."|FALSE
836|"'Look 'ere!' she cried, 'my only basin; and what the powers am I to"|FALSE
836|"make the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for your"|FALSE
836|"dinners? You don't deserve no dinners, so yer don't.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm awfully sorry, cook,' said Anthea gently; 'it was my fault, and"|FALSE
836|"I forgot to tell you about it. It got broken when we were telling our"|FALSE
836|"fortunes with melted lead, you know, and I meant to tell you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Meant to tell me,' replied the cook; she was red with anger, and really"|FALSE
836|"I don't wonder--'meant to tell! Well, _I_ mean to tell, too. I've held"|FALSE
836|"my tongue this week through, because the missus she said to me quiet"|FALSE
836|"like, \"We mustn't expect old heads on young shoulders,\" but now I shan't"|FALSE
836|"hold it no longer. There was the soap you put in our pudding, and me and"|FALSE
836|"Eliza never so much as breathed it to your ma--though well we might--and"|FALSE
836|"the saucepan, and the fish-slice, and--My gracious cats alive! what 'ave"|FALSE
836|"you got that blessed child dressed up in his outdoors for?'"|FALSE
836|"'We aren't going to take him out,' said Anthea; 'at least--' She stopped"|FALSE
836|"short, for though they weren't going to take him out in the Kentish"|FALSE
836|"Town Road, they certainly intended to take him elsewhere. But not at all"|FALSE
836|"where cook meant when she said 'out'. This confused the truthful Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Out!' said the cook, 'that I'll take care you don't;' and she snatched"|FALSE
836|"the Lamb from the lap of Jane, while Anthea and Robert caught her by the"|FALSE
836|"skirts and apron. 'Look here,' said Cyril, in stern desperation, 'will"|FALSE
836|"you go away, and make your pudding in a pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or a"|FALSE
836|"hot-water can, or something?'"|FALSE
836|"'Not me,' said the cook, briefly; 'and leave this precious poppet for"|FALSE
836|"you to give his deathercold to.'"|FALSE
836|"'I warn you,' said Cyril, solemnly. 'Beware, ere yet it be too late.'"|FALSE
836|"'Late yourself the little popsey-wopsey,' said the cook, with angry"|FALSE
836|"tenderness. 'They shan't take it out, no more they shan't. And--Where"|FALSE
836|"did you get that there yellow fowl?' She pointed to the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"Even Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss would"|FALSE
836|"be theirs."|FALSE
836|"'I wish,' she said suddenly, 'we were on a sunny southern shore, where"|FALSE
836|"there can't be any whooping-cough.'"|FALSE
836|"She said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb, and the sturdy"|FALSE
836|"scoldings of the cook, and instantly the giddy-go-round-and-falling-lift"|FALSE
836|"feeling swept over the whole party, and the cook sat down flat on the"|FALSE
836|"carpet, holding the screaming Lamb tight to her stout print-covered"|FALSE
836|"self, and calling on St Bridget to help her. She was an Irishwoman."|FALSE
836|"The moment the tipsy-topsy-turvy feeling stopped, the cook opened her"|FALSE
836|"eyes, gave one sounding screech and shut them again, and Anthea took the"|FALSE
836|"opportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her own arms."|FALSE
836|"'It's all right,' she said; 'own Panther's got you. Look at the trees,"|FALSE
836|"and the sand, and the shells, and the great big tortoises. Oh DEAR, how"|FALSE
836|"hot it is!'"|FALSE
836|"It certainly was; for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on a"|FALSE
836|"southern shore that was sunny and no mistake, as Robert remarked. The"|FALSE
836|"greenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where palm-trees and"|FALSE
836|"all the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of in Westward Ho! and"|FALSE
836|"Fair Play were growing in rich profusion. Between the green, green slope"|FALSE
836|"and the blue, blue sea lay a stretch of sand that looked like a carpet"|FALSE
836|"of jewelled cloth of gold, for it was not greyish as our northern sand"|FALSE
836|"is, but yellow and changing--opal-coloured like sunshine and rainbows."|FALSE
836|"And at the very moment when the wild, whirling, blinding, deafening,"|FALSE
836|"tumbling upside-downness of the carpet-moving stopped, the children had"|FALSE
836|"the happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the edge"|FALSE
836|"of the sea and disappear in the water. And it was hotter than you can"|FALSE
836|"possibly imagine, unless you think of ovens on a baking-day."|FALSE
836|"Every one without an instant's hesitation tore off its"|FALSE
836|"London-in-November outdoor clothes, and Anthea took off the Lamb's"|FALSE
836|"highwayman blue coat and his three-cornered hat, and then his jersey,"|FALSE
836|"and then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his little blue tight"|FALSE
836|"breeches and stood up happy and hot in his little white shirt."|FALSE
836|"'I'm sure it's much warmer than the seaside in the summer,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Mother always lets us go barefoot then.'"|FALSE
836|"So the Lamb's shoes and socks and gaiters came off, and he stood digging"|FALSE
836|"his happy naked pink toes into the golden smooth sand."|FALSE
836|"'I'm a little white duck-dickie,' said he--'a little white duck-dickie"|FALSE
836|"what swims,' and splashed quacking into a sandy pool."|FALSE
836|"'Let him,' said Anthea; 'it can't hurt him. Oh, how hot it is!'"|FALSE
836|"The cook suddenly opened her eyes and screamed, shut them, screamed"|FALSE
836|"again, opened her eyes once more and said--"|FALSE
836|"'Why, drat my cats alive, what's all this? It's a dream, I expect."|FALSE
836|"Well, it's the best I ever dreamed. I'll look it up in the dream-book"|FALSE
836|"to-morrow. Seaside and trees and a carpet to sit on. I never did!'"|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Cyril, 'it isn't a dream; it's real.'"|FALSE
836|"'Ho yes!' said the cook; 'they always says that in dreams.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's REAL, I tell you,' Robert said, stamping his foot. 'I'm not going"|FALSE
836|"to tell you how it's done, because that's our secret.' He winked heavily"|FALSE
836|"at each of the others in turn. 'But you wouldn't go away and make that"|FALSE
836|"pudding, so we HAD to bring you, and I hope you like it.'"|FALSE
836|"'I do that, and no mistake,' said the cook unexpectedly; 'and it being a"|FALSE
836|"dream it don't matter what I say; and I WILL say, if it's my last word,"|FALSE
836|"that of all the aggravating little varmints--' 'Calm yourself, my good"|FALSE
836|"woman,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Good woman, indeed,' said the cook; 'good woman yourself' Then she"|FALSE
836|"saw who it was that had spoken. 'Well, if I ever,' said she; 'this is"|FALSE
836|"something like a dream! Yellow fowls a-talking and all! I've heard of"|FALSE
836|"such, but never did I think to see the day.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, then,' said Cyril, impatiently, 'sit here and see the day now."|FALSE
836|"It's a jolly fine day. Here, you others--a council!' They walked along"|FALSE
836|"the shore till they were out of earshot of the cook, who still sat"|FALSE
836|"gazing about her with a happy, dreamy, vacant smile."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Cyril, 'we must roll the carpet up and hide it, so"|FALSE
836|"that we can get at it at any moment. The Lamb can be getting rid of"|FALSE
836|"his whooping-cough all the morning, and we can look about; and if the"|FALSE
836|"savages on this island are cannibals, we'll hook it, and take her back."|FALSE
836|"And if not, we'll LEAVE HER HERE.'"|FALSE
836|"'Is that being kind to servants and animals, like the clergyman said?'"|FALSE
836|"asked Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Nor she isn't kind,' retorted Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'Well--anyway,' said Anthea, 'the safest thing is to leave the carpet"|FALSE
836|"there with her sitting on it. Perhaps it'll be a lesson to her, and"|FALSE
836|"anyway, if she thinks it's a dream it won't matter what she says when"|FALSE
836|"she gets home.'"|FALSE
836|"So the extra coats and hats and mufflers were piled on the carpet. Cyril"|FALSE
836|"shouldered the well and happy Lamb, the Phoenix perched on Robert's"|FALSE
836|"wrist, and 'the party of explorers prepared to enter the interior'."|FALSE
836|"The grassy slope was smooth, but under the trees there were tangled"|FALSE
836|"creepers with bright, strange-shaped flowers, and it was not easy to"|FALSE
836|"walk."|FALSE
836|"'We ought to have an explorer's axe,' said Robert. 'I shall ask father"|FALSE
836|"to give me one for Christmas.'"|FALSE
836|"There were curtains of creepers with scented blossoms hanging from the"|FALSE
836|"trees, and brilliant birds darted about quite close to their faces."|FALSE
836|"'Now, tell me honestly,' said the Phoenix, 'are there any birds here"|FALSE
836|"handsomer than I am? Don't be afraid of hurting my feelings--I'm a"|FALSE
836|"modest bird, I hope.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not one of them,' said Robert, with conviction, 'is a patch upon you!'"|FALSE
836|"'I was never a vain bird,' said the Phoenix, 'but I own that you confirm"|FALSE
836|"my own impression. I will take a flight.' It circled in the air for a"|FALSE
836|"moment, and, returning to Robert's wrist, went on, 'There is a path to"|FALSE
836|"the left.'"|FALSE
836|"And there was. So now the children went on through the wood more quickly"|FALSE
836|"and comfortably, the girls picking flowers and the Lamb inviting"|FALSE

836|"real-water-wet duck!'"|FALSE
836|"And all this time he hadn't whooping-coughed once."|FALSE
836|"The path turned and twisted, and, always threading their way amid a"|FALSE
836|"tangle of flowers, the children suddenly passed a corner and found"|FALSE
836|"themselves in a forest clearing, where there were a lot of pointed"|FALSE
836|"huts--the huts, as they knew at once, of SAVAGES."|FALSE
836|"The boldest heart beat more quickly. Suppose they WERE cannibals. It was"|FALSE
836|"a long way back to the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Hadn't we better go back?' said Jane. 'Go NOW,' she said, and her voice"|FALSE
836|"trembled a little. 'Suppose they eat us.'"|FALSE
836|"'Nonsense, Pussy,' said Cyril, firmly. 'Look, there's a goat tied up."|FALSE
836|"That shows they don't eat PEOPLE.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let's go on and say we're missionaries,' Robert suggested."|FALSE
836|"'I shouldn't advise THAT,' said the Phoenix, very earnestly."|FALSE
836|"'Why not?'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, for one thing, it isn't true,' replied the golden bird."|FALSE
836|"It was while they stood hesitating on the edge of the clearing that"|FALSE
836|"a tall man suddenly came out of one of the huts. He had hardly any"|FALSE
836|"clothes, and his body all over was a dark and beautiful coppery"|FALSE
836|"colour--just like the chrysanthemums father had brought home on"|FALSE
836|"Saturday. In his hand he held a spear. The whites of his eyes and the"|FALSE
836|"white of his teeth were the only light things about him, except that"|FALSE
836|"where the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white, too. If"|FALSE
836|"you will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet with next to"|FALSE
836|"nothing on, you will see at once--if the sun happens to be shining at"|FALSE
836|"the time--that I am right about this."|FALSE
836|"The savage looked at the children. Concealment was impossible. He"|FALSE
836|"uttered a shout that was more like 'Oo goggery bag-wag' than anything"|FALSE
836|"else the children had ever heard, and at once brown coppery people leapt"|FALSE
836|"out of every hut, and swarmed like ants about the clearing. There was"|FALSE
836|"no time for discussion, and no one wanted to discuss anything, anyhow."|FALSE
836|"Whether these coppery people were cannibals or not now seemed to matter"|FALSE
836|"very little."|FALSE
836|"Without an instant's hesitation the four children turned and ran back"|FALSE
836|"along the forest path; the only pause was Anthea's. She stood back to"|FALSE
836|"let Cyril pass, because he was carrying the Lamb, who screamed with"|FALSE
836|"delight. (He had not whooping-coughed a single once since the carpet"|FALSE
836|"landed him on the island.)"|FALSE
836|"'Gee-up, Squirrel; gee-gee,' he shouted, and Cyril did gee-up. The path"|FALSE
836|"was a shorter cut to the beach than the creeper-covered way by which"|FALSE
836|"they had come, and almost directly they saw through the trees the"|FALSE
836|"shining blue-and-gold-and-opal of sand and sea."|FALSE
836|"'Stick to it,' cried Cyril, breathlessly."|FALSE
836|"They did stick to it; they tore down the sands--they could hear behind"|FALSE
836|"them as they ran the patter of feet which they knew, too well, were"|FALSE
836|"copper-coloured."|FALSE
836|"The sands were golden and opal-coloured--and BARE. There were wreaths of"|FALSE
836|"tropic seaweed, there were rich tropic shells of the kind you would not"|FALSE
836|"buy in the Kentish Town Road under at least fifteen pence a pair."|FALSE
836|"There were turtles basking lumpily on the water's edge--but no cook, no"|FALSE
836|"clothes, and no carpet."|FALSE
836|"'On, on! Into the sea!' gasped Cyril. 'They MUST hate water."|FALSE
836|"I've--heard--savages always--dirty.'"|FALSE
836|"Their feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his breathless"|FALSE
836|"words were ended. The calm baby-waves were easy to go through. It is"|FALSE
836|"warm work running for your life in the tropics, and the coolness of the"|FALSE
836|"water was delicious. They were up to their arm-pits now, and Jane was up"|FALSE
836|"to her chin."|FALSE
836|"'Look!' said the Phoenix. 'What are they pointing at?'"|FALSE
836|"The children turned; and there, a little to the west was a head--a head"|FALSE
836|"they knew, with a crooked cap upon it. It was the head of the cook."|FALSE
836|"For some reason or other the savages had stopped at the water's edge"|FALSE
836|"and were all talking at the top of their voices, and all were pointing"|FALSE
836|"copper-coloured fingers, stiff with interest and excitement, at the head"|FALSE
836|"of the cook."|FALSE
836|"The children hurried towards her as quickly as the water would let them."|FALSE
836|"'What on earth did you come out here for?' Robert shouted; 'and where on"|FALSE
836|"earth's the carpet?'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not on earth, bless you,' replied the cook, happily; 'it's UNDER"|FALSE
836|"ME--in the water. I got a bit warm setting there in the sun, and I just"|FALSE
836|"says, \"I wish I was in a cold bath\"--just like that--and next minute"|FALSE
836|"here I was! It's all part of the dream.'"|FALSE
836|"Every one at once saw how extremely fortunate it was that the carpet had"|FALSE
836|"had the sense to take the cook to the nearest and largest bath--the sea,"|FALSE
836|"and how terrible it would have been if the carpet had taken itself and"|FALSE
836|"her to the stuffy little bath-room of the house in Camden Town!"|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said the Phoenix's soft voice, breaking in on the general"|FALSE
836|"sigh of relief, 'but I think these brown people want your cook.'"|FALSE
836|"'To--to eat?' whispered Jane, as well as she could through the water"|FALSE
836|"which the plunging Lamb was dashing in her face with happy fat hands and"|FALSE
836|"feet."|FALSE
836|"'Hardly,' rejoined the bird. 'Who wants cooks to EAT? Cooks are ENGAGED,"|FALSE
836|"not eaten. They wish to engage her.'"|FALSE
836|"'How can you understand what they say?' asked Cyril, doubtfully."|FALSE
836|"'It's as easy as kissing your claw,' replied the bird. 'I speak and"|FALSE
836|"understand ALL languages, even that of your cook, which is difficult and"|FALSE
836|"unpleasing. It's quite easy, when you know how it's done. It just comes"|FALSE
836|"to you. I should advise you to beach the carpet and land the cargo--the"|FALSE
836|"cook, I mean. You can take my word for it, the copper-coloured ones will"|FALSE
836|"not harm you now.'"|FALSE
836|"It is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells you"|FALSE
836|"to. So the children at once got hold of the corners of the carpet,"|FALSE
836|"and, pulling it from under the cook, towed it slowly in through the"|FALSE
836|"shallowing water, and at last spread it on the sand. The cook, who had"|FALSE
836|"followed, instantly sat down on it, and at once the copper-coloured"|FALSE
836|"natives, now strangely humble, formed a ring round the carpet, and fell"|FALSE
836|"on their faces on the rainbow-and-gold sand. The tallest savage spoke"|FALSE
836|"in this position, which must have been very awkward for him; and Jane"|FALSE
836|"noticed that it took him quite a long time to get the sand out of his"|FALSE
836|"mouth afterwards."|FALSE
836|"'He says,' the Phoenix remarked after some time, 'that they wish to"|FALSE
836|"engage your cook permanently.'"|FALSE
836|"'Without a character?' asked Anthea, who had heard her mother speak of"|FALSE
836|"such things."|FALSE
836|"'They do not wish to engage her as cook, but as queen; and queens need"|FALSE
836|"not have characters.'"|FALSE
836|"There was a breathless pause."|FALSE
836|"'WELL,' said Cyril, 'of all the choices! But there's no accounting for"|FALSE
836|"tastes.'"|FALSE
836|"Every one laughed at the idea of the cook's being engaged as queen; they"|FALSE
836|"could not help it."|FALSE
836|"'I do not advise laughter,' warned the Phoenix, ruffling out his golden"|FALSE
836|"feathers, which were extremely wet. 'And it's not their own choice. It"|FALSE
836|"seems that there is an ancient prophecy of this copper-coloured tribe"|FALSE
836|"that a great queen should some day arise out of the sea with a white"|FALSE
836|"crown on her head, and--and--well, you see! There's the crown!'"|FALSE
836|"It pointed its claw at cook's cap; and a very dirty cap it was, because"|FALSE
836|"it was the end of the week."|FALSE
836|"'That's the white crown,' it said; 'at least, it's nearly white--very"|FALSE
836|"white indeed compared to the colour THEY are--and anyway, it's quite"|FALSE
836|"white enough.'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril addressed the cook. 'Look here!' said he, 'these brown people want"|FALSE
836|"you to be their queen. They're only savages, and they don't know any"|FALSE
836|"better. Now would you really like to stay? or, if you'll promise not to"|FALSE
836|"be so jolly aggravating at home, and not to tell any one a word about"|FALSE
836|"to-day, we'll take you back to Camden Town.'"|FALSE
836|"'No, you don't,' said the cook, in firm, undoubting tones. 'I've always"|FALSE
836|"wanted to be the Queen, God bless her! and I always thought what a good"|FALSE
836|"one I should make; and now I'm going to. IF it's only in a dream, it's"|FALSE
836|"well worth while. And I don't go back to that nasty underground kitchen,"|FALSE
836|"and me blamed for everything; that I don't, not till the dream's"|FALSE
836|"finished and I wake up with that nasty bell a rang-tanging in my"|FALSE
836|"ears--so I tell you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Are you SURE,' Anthea anxiously asked the Phoenix, 'that she will be"|FALSE
836|"quite safe here?'"|FALSE
836|"'She will find the nest of a queen a very precious and soft thing,' said"|FALSE
836|"the bird, solemnly."|FALSE
836|"'There--you hear,' said Cyril. 'You're in for a precious soft thing,"|FALSE
836|"so mind you're a good queen, cook. It's more than you'd any right to"|FALSE
836|"expect, but long may you reign.'"|FALSE
836|"Some of the cook's copper-coloured subjects now advanced from the forest"|FALSE
836|"with long garlands of beautiful flowers, white and sweet-scented, and"|FALSE
836|"hung them respectfully round the neck of their new sovereign."|FALSE
836|"'What! all them lovely bokays for me!' exclaimed the enraptured cook."|FALSE
836|"'Well, this here is something LIKE a dream, I must say.'"|FALSE
836|"She sat up very straight on the carpet, and the copper-coloured ones,"|FALSE
836|"themselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers, madly stuck"|FALSE
836|"parrot feathers in their hair and began to dance. It was a dance such as"|FALSE
836|"you have never seen; it made the children feel almost sure that the"|FALSE
836|"cook was right, and that they were all in a dream. Small, strange-shaped"|FALSE
836|"drums were beaten, odd-sounding songs were sung, and the dance got"|FALSE
836|"faster and faster and odder and odder, till at last all the dancers fell"|FALSE
836|"on the sand tired out."|FALSE
836|"The new queen, with her white crown-cap all on one side, clapped wildly."|FALSE
836|"'Brayvo!' she cried, 'brayvo! It's better than the Albert Edward"|FALSE
836|"Music-hall in the Kentish Town Road. Go it again!'"|FALSE
836|"But the Phoenix would not translate this request into the"|FALSE
836|"copper-coloured language; and when the savages had recovered their"|FALSE
836|"breath, they implored their queen to leave her white escort and come"|FALSE
836|"with them to their huts."|FALSE
836|"'The finest shall be yours, O queen,' said they."|FALSE
836|"'Well--so long!' said the cook, getting heavily on to her feet, when the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix had translated this request. 'No more kitchens and attics for"|FALSE
836|"me, thank you. I'm off to my royal palace, I am; and I only wish this"|FALSE
836|"here dream would keep on for ever and ever.'"|FALSE
836|"She picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet,"|FALSE
836|"and the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and worn"|FALSE
836|"elastic-side boots before she disappeared into the shadow of the forest,"|FALSE
836|"surrounded by her dusky retainers, singing songs of rejoicing as they"|FALSE
836|"went."|FALSE
836|"'WELL!' said Cyril, 'I suppose she's all right, but they don't seem to"|FALSE
836|"count us for much, one way or the other.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh,' said the Phoenix, 'they think you're merely dreams. The prophecy"|FALSE
836|"said that the queen would arise from the waves with a white crown and"|FALSE
836|"surrounded by white dream-children. That's about what they think YOU"|FALSE
836|"are!'"|FALSE
836|"'And what about dinner?' said Robert, abruptly."|FALSE
836|"'There won't be any dinner, with no cook and no pudding-basin,' Anthea"|FALSE
836|"reminded him; 'but there's always bread-and-butter.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let's get home,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"The Lamb was furiously unwishful to be dressed in his warm clothes"|FALSE
836|"again, but Anthea and Jane managed it, by force disguised as coaxing,"|FALSE
836|"and he never once whooping-coughed."|FALSE
836|"Then every one put on its own warm things and took its place on the"|FALSE
836|"carpet."|FALSE
836|"A sound of uncouth singing still came from beyond the trees where the"|FALSE
836|"copper-coloured natives were crooning songs of admiration and respect"|FALSE
836|"to their white-crowned queen. Then Anthea said 'Home,' just as duchesses"|FALSE
836|"and other people do to their coachmen, and the intelligent carpet in"|FALSE
836|"one whirling moment laid itself down in its proper place on the nursery"|FALSE
836|"floor. And at that very moment Eliza opened the door and said--"|FALSE
836|"'Cook's gone! I can't find her anywhere, and there's no dinner ready."|FALSE
836|"She hasn't taken her box nor yet her outdoor things. She just ran out to"|FALSE
836|"see the time, I shouldn't wonder--the kitchen clock never did give her"|FALSE
836|"satisfaction--and she's got run over or fell down in a fit as likely"|FALSE
836|"as not. You'll have to put up with the cold bacon for your dinners; and"|FALSE
836|"what on earth you've got your outdoor things on for I don't know."|FALSE
836|"And then I'll slip out and see if they know anything about her at the"|FALSE
836|"police-station.'"|FALSE
836|"But nobody ever knew anything about the cook any more, except the"|FALSE
836|"children, and, later, one other person."|FALSE
836|"Mother was so upset at losing the cook, and so anxious about her, that"|FALSE
836|"Anthea felt most miserable, as though she had done something very wrong"|FALSE
836|"indeed. She woke several times in the night, and at last decided that"|FALSE
836|"she would ask the Phoenix to let her tell her mother all about it. But"|FALSE
836|"there was no opportunity to do this next day, because the Phoenix, as"|FALSE
836|"usual, had gone to sleep in some out-of-the-way spot, after asking, as a"|FALSE
836|"special favour, not to be disturbed for twenty-four hours."|FALSE
836|"The Lamb never whooping-coughed once all that Sunday, and mother and"|FALSE
836|"father said what good medicine it was that the doctor had given him. But"|FALSE
836|"the children knew that it was the southern shore where you can't have"|FALSE
836|"whooping-cough that had cured him. The Lamb babbled of coloured sand"|FALSE
836|"and water, but no one took any notice of that. He often talked of things"|FALSE
836|"that hadn't happened."|FALSE
836|"It was on Monday morning, very early indeed, that Anthea woke and"|FALSE
836|"suddenly made up her mind. She crept downstairs in her night-gown (it"|FALSE
836|"was very chilly), sat down on the carpet, and with a beating heart"|FALSE
836|"wished herself on the sunny shore where you can't have whooping-cough,"|FALSE
836|"and next moment there she was."|FALSE
836|"The sand was splendidly warm. She could feel it at once, even through"|FALSE
836|"the carpet. She folded the carpet, and put it over her shoulders like"|FALSE
836|"a shawl, for she was determined not to be parted from it for a single"|FALSE
836|"instant, no matter how hot it might be to wear."|FALSE
836|"Then trembling a little, and trying to keep up her courage by saying"|FALSE
836|"over and over, 'It is my DUTY, it IS my duty,' she went up the forest"|FALSE
836|"path."|FALSE
836|"'Well, here you are again,' said the cook, directly she saw Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'This dream does keep on!'"|FALSE
836|"The cook was dressed in a white robe; she had no shoes and stockings"|FALSE
836|"and no cap and she was sitting under a screen of palm-leaves, for it was"|FALSE
836|"afternoon in the island, and blazing hot. She wore a flower wreath"|FALSE
836|"on her hair, and copper-coloured boys were fanning her with peacock's"|FALSE
836|"feathers."|FALSE
836|"'They've got the cap put away,' she said. 'They seem to think a lot of"|FALSE
836|"it. Never saw one before, I expect.'"|FALSE
836|"'Are you happy?' asked Anthea, panting; the sight of the cook as queen"|FALSE
836|"quite took her breath away."|FALSE
836|"'I believe you, my dear,' said the cook, heartily. 'Nothing to do unless"|FALSE
836|"you want to. But I'm getting rested now. Tomorrow I'm going to start"|FALSE
836|"cleaning out my hut, if the dream keeps on, and I shall teach them"|FALSE
836|"cooking; they burns everything to a cinder now unless they eats it raw.'"|FALSE
836|"'But can you talk to them?'"|FALSE
836|"'Lor' love a duck, yes!' the happy cook-queen replied; 'it's quite easy"|FALSE
836|"to pick up. I always thought I should be quick at foreign languages."|FALSE
836|"I've taught them to understand \"dinner,\" and \"I want a drink,\" and \"You"|FALSE
836|"leave me be,\" already.'"|FALSE
836|"'Then you don't want anything?' Anthea asked earnestly and anxiously."|FALSE
836|"'Not me, miss; except if you'd only go away. I'm afraid of me waking"|FALSE
836|"up with that bell a-going if you keep on stopping here a-talking to me."|FALSE
836|"Long as this here dream keeps up I'm as happy as a queen.'"|FALSE
836|"'Goodbye, then,' said Anthea, gaily, for her conscience was clear now."|FALSE
836|"She hurried into the wood, threw herself on the ground, and said"|FALSE
836|"'Home'--and there she was, rolled in the carpet on the nursery floor."|FALSE
836|"'SHE'S all right, anyhow,' said Anthea, and went back to bed. 'I'm glad"|FALSE
836|"somebody's pleased. But mother will never believe me when I tell her.'"|FALSE
836|"The story is indeed a little difficult to believe. Still, you might try."|FALSE
836|"CHAPTER 4. TWO BAZAARS"|FALSE
836|"Mother was really a great dear. She was pretty and she was loving, and"|FALSE
836|"most frightfully good when you were ill, and always kind, and almost"|FALSE
836|"always just. That is, she was just when she understood things. But"|FALSE
836|"of course she did not always understand things. No one understands"|FALSE
836|"everything, and mothers are not angels, though a good many of them come"|FALSE
836|"pretty near it. The children knew that mother always WANTED to do what"|FALSE
836|"was best for them, even if she was not clever enough to know exactly"|FALSE
836|"what was the best. That was why all of them, but much more particularly"|FALSE
836|"Anthea, felt rather uncomfortable at keeping the great secret from her"|FALSE
836|"of the wishing carpet and the Phoenix. And Anthea, whose inside mind was"|FALSE
836|"made so that she was able to be much more uncomfortable than the others,"|FALSE
836|"had decided that she MUST tell her mother the truth, however little"|FALSE
836|"likely it was that her mother would believe it."|FALSE
836|"'Then I shall have done what's right,' said she to the Phoenix; 'and if"|FALSE
836|"she doesn't believe me it won't be my fault--will it?'"|FALSE
836|"'Not in the least,' said the golden bird. 'And she won't, so you're"|FALSE
836|"quite safe.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea chose a time when she was doing her home-lessons--they were"|FALSE
836|"Algebra and Latin, German, English, and Euclid--and she asked her mother"|FALSE
836|"whether she might come and do them in the drawing-room--'so as to be"|FALSE
836|"quiet,' she said to her mother; and to herself she said, 'And that's not"|FALSE
836|"the real reason. I hope I shan't grow up a LIAR.'"|FALSE
836|"Mother said, 'Of course, dearie,' and Anthea started swimming through"|FALSE
836|"a sea of x's and y's and z's. Mother was sitting at the mahogany bureau"|FALSE
836|"writing letters."|FALSE
836|"'Mother dear,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Yes, love-a-duck,' said mother."|FALSE
836|"'About cook,' said Anthea. '_I_ know where she is.'"|FALSE
836|"'Do you, dear?' said mother. 'Well, I wouldn't take her back after the"|FALSE
836|"way she has behaved.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not her fault,' said Anthea. 'May I tell you about it from the"|FALSE
836|"beginning?'"|FALSE
836|"Mother laid down her pen, and her nice face had a resigned expression."|FALSE
836|"As you know, a resigned expression always makes you want not to tell"|FALSE
836|"anybody anything."|FALSE
836|"'It's like this,' said Anthea, in a hurry: 'that egg, you know, that"|FALSE
836|"came in the carpet; we put it in the fire and it hatched into the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix, and the carpet was a wishing carpet--and--'"|FALSE
836|"'A very nice game, darling,' said mother, taking up her pen. 'Now do"|FALSE
836|"be quiet. I've got a lot of letters to write. I'm going to Bournemouth"|FALSE
836|"to-morrow with the Lamb--and there's that bazaar.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea went back to x y z, and mother's pen scratched busily."|FALSE

836|"'It shall,' said Anthea, 'but, mother--'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, dear,' said mother, a little impatiently, for she had taken up"|FALSE
836|"her pen again."|FALSE
836|"'The carpet took us to a place where you couldn't have whooping-cough,"|FALSE
836|"and the Lamb hasn't whooped since, and we took cook because she was"|FALSE
836|"so tiresome, and then she would stay and be queen of the savages. They"|FALSE
836|"thought her cap was a crown, and--'"|FALSE
836|"'Darling one,' said mother, 'you know I love to hear the things you make"|FALSE
836|"up--but I am most awfully busy.'"|FALSE
836|"'But it's true,' said Anthea, desperately."|FALSE
836|"'You shouldn't say that, my sweet,' said mother, gently. And then Anthea"|FALSE
836|"knew it was hopeless."|FALSE
836|"'Are you going away for long?' asked Anthea."|FALSE

836|"Scotland. I do hope you'll be good children.'"|FALSE
836|"'We will, we will,' said Anthea, fervently. 'When's the bazaar?'"|FALSE
836|"'On Saturday,' said mother, 'at the schools. Oh, don't talk any more,"|FALSE
836|"there's a treasure! My head's going round, and I've forgotten how to"|FALSE
836|"spell whooping-cough.'"|FALSE
836|"Mother and the Lamb went away, and father went away, and there was a new"|FALSE
836|"cook who looked so like a frightened rabbit that no one had the heart to"|FALSE
836|"do anything to frighten her any more than seemed natural to her."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix begged to be excused. It said it wanted a week's rest, and"|FALSE
836|"asked that it might not be disturbed. And it hid its golden gleaming"|FALSE
836|"self, and nobody could find it."|FALSE
836|"So that when Wednesday afternoon brought an unexpected holiday, and"|FALSE
836|"every one decided to go somewhere on the carpet, the journey had to"|FALSE

836|"agitation of parting, that they would not be out after six at night,"|FALSE
836|"except on Saturday, when they were to go to the bazaar, and were pledged"|FALSE
836|"to put on their best clothes, to wash themselves to the uttermost, and"|FALSE
836|"to clean their nails--not with scissors, which are scratchy and bad,"|FALSE
836|"but with flat-sharpened ends of wooden matches, which do no harm to any"|FALSE
836|"one's nails."|FALSE
836|"'Let's go and see the Lamb,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"But every one was agreed that if they appeared suddenly in Bournemouth"|FALSE
836|"it would frighten mother out of her wits, if not into a fit. So they"|FALSE
836|"sat on the carpet, and thought and thought and thought till they almost"|FALSE
836|"began to squint."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Cyril, 'I know. Please carpet, take us somewhere where"|FALSE
836|"we can see the Lamb and mother and no one can see us.'"|FALSE
836|"'Except the Lamb,' said Jane, quickly."|FALSE
836|"And the next moment they found themselves recovering from the"|FALSE
836|"upside-down movement--and there they were sitting on the carpet, and"|FALSE
836|"the carpet was laid out over another thick soft carpet of brown"|FALSE
836|"pine-needles. There were green pine-trees overhead, and a swift clear"|FALSE
836|"little stream was running as fast as ever it could between steep"|FALSE
836|"banks--and there, sitting on the pine-needle carpet, was mother, without"|FALSE
836|"her hat; and the sun was shining brightly, although it was November--and"|FALSE
836|"there was the Lamb, as jolly as jolly and not whooping at all."|FALSE
836|"'The carpet's deceived us,' said Robert, gloomily; 'mother will see us"|FALSE
836|"directly she turns her head.'"|FALSE
836|"But the faithful carpet had not deceived them."|FALSE
836|"Mother turned her dear head and looked straight at them, and DID NOT SEE"|FALSE
836|"THEM!"|FALSE
836|"'We're invisible,' Cyril whispered: 'what awful larks!'"|FALSE
836|"But to the girls it was not larks at all. It was horrible to have mother"|FALSE
836|"looking straight at them, and her face keeping the same, just as though"|FALSE
836|"they weren't there."|FALSE
836|"'I don't like it,' said Jane. 'Mother never looked at us like that"|FALSE
836|"before. Just as if she didn't love us--as if we were somebody else's"|FALSE
836|"children, and not very nice ones either--as if she didn't care whether"|FALSE
836|"she saw us or not.'"|FALSE
836|"'It is horrid,' said Anthea, almost in tears."|FALSE
836|"But at this moment the Lamb saw them, and plunged towards the carpet,"|FALSE
836|"shrieking, 'Panty, own Panty--an' Pussy, an' Squiggle--an' Bobs, oh,"|FALSE
836|"oh!'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea caught him and kissed him, so did Jane; they could not help"|FALSE
836|"it--he looked such a darling, with his blue three-cornered hat all on"|FALSE
836|"one side, and his precious face all dirty--quite in the old familiar"|FALSE
836|"way."|FALSE
836|"'I love you, Panty; I love you--and you, and you, and you,' cried the"|FALSE
836|"Lamb."|FALSE
836|"It was a delicious moment. Even the boys thumped their baby brother"|FALSE
836|"joyously on the back."|FALSE
836|"Then Anthea glanced at mother--and mother's face was a pale sea-green"|FALSE
836|"colour, and she was staring at the Lamb as if she thought he had gone"|FALSE
836|"mad. And, indeed, that was exactly what she did think."|FALSE
836|"'My Lamb, my precious! Come to mother,' she cried, and jumped up and ran"|FALSE
836|"to the baby."|FALSE
836|"She was so quick that the invisible children had to leap back, or she"|FALSE
836|"would have felt them; and to feel what you can't see is the worst sort"|FALSE
836|"of ghost-feeling. Mother picked up the Lamb and hurried away from the"|FALSE
836|"pinewood."|FALSE
836|"'Let's go home,' said Jane, after a miserable silence. 'It feels just"|FALSE
836|"exactly as if mother didn't love us.'"|FALSE
836|"But they couldn't bear to go home till they had seen mother meet another"|FALSE
836|"lady, and knew that she was safe. You cannot leave your mother to go"|FALSE
836|"green in the face in a distant pinewood, far from all human aid, and"|FALSE
836|"then go home on your wishing carpet as though nothing had happened."|FALSE
836|"When mother seemed safe the children returned to the carpet, and said"|FALSE
836|"'Home'--and home they went."|FALSE
836|"'I don't care about being invisible myself,' said Cyril, 'at least, not"|FALSE
836|"with my own family. It would be different if you were a prince, or a"|FALSE
836|"bandit, or a burglar.'"|FALSE
836|"And now the thoughts of all four dwelt fondly on the dear greenish face"|FALSE
836|"of mother."|FALSE
836|"'I wish she hadn't gone away,' said Jane; 'the house is simply beastly"|FALSE
836|"without her.'"|FALSE
836|"'I think we ought to do what she said,' Anthea put in. 'I saw something"|FALSE
836|"in a book the other day about the wishes of the departed being sacred.'"|FALSE
836|"'That means when they've departed farther off,' said Cyril. 'India's"|FALSE
836|"coral or Greenland's icy, don't you know; not Bournemouth. Besides, we"|FALSE
836|"don't know what her wishes are.'"|FALSE
836|"'She SAID'--Anthea was very much inclined to cry--'she said, \"Get Indian"|FALSE
836|"things for my bazaar;\" but I know she thought we couldn't, and it was"|FALSE
836|"only play.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let's get them all the same,' said Robert. 'We'll go the first thing on"|FALSE
836|"Saturday morning.'"|FALSE
836|"And on Saturday morning, the first thing, they went."|FALSE
836|"There was no finding the Phoenix, so they sat on the beautiful wishing"|FALSE
836|"carpet, and said--"|FALSE
836|"'We want Indian things for mother's bazaar. Will you please take us"|FALSE
836|"where people will give us heaps of Indian things?'"|FALSE
836|"The docile carpet swirled their senses away, and restored them on the"|FALSE
836|"outskirts of a gleaming white Indian town. They knew it was Indian at"|FALSE
836|"once, by the shape of the domes and roofs; and besides, a man went by on"|FALSE
836|"an elephant, and two English soldiers went along the road, talking like"|FALSE
836|"in Mr Kipling's books--so after that no one could have any doubt as to"|FALSE
836|"where they were. They rolled up the carpet and Robert carried it, and"|FALSE
836|"they walked bodily into the town."|FALSE
836|"It was very warm, and once more they had to take off their"|FALSE
836|"London-in-November coats, and carry them on their arms."|FALSE
836|"The streets were narrow and strange, and the clothes of the people in"|FALSE
836|"the streets were stranger and the talk of the people was strangest of"|FALSE
836|"all."|FALSE
836|"'I can't understand a word,' said Cyril. 'How on earth are we to ask for"|FALSE
836|"things for our bazaar?'"|FALSE
836|"'And they're poor people, too,' said Jane; 'I'm sure they are. What we"|FALSE
836|"want is a rajah or something.'"|FALSE
836|"Robert was beginning to unroll the carpet, but the others stopped him,"|FALSE
836|"imploring him not to waste a wish."|FALSE
836|"'We asked the carpet to take us where we could get Indian things for"|FALSE
836|"bazaars,' said Anthea, 'and it will.'"|FALSE
836|"Her faith was justified."|FALSE
836|"Just as she finished speaking a very brown gentleman in a turban came"|FALSE
836|"up to them and bowed deeply. He spoke, and they thrilled to the sound of"|FALSE
836|"English words."|FALSE
836|"'My ranee, she think you very nice childs. She asks do you lose"|FALSE
836|"yourselves, and do you desire to sell carpet? She see you from her"|FALSE
836|"palkee. You come see her--yes?'"|FALSE
836|"They followed the stranger, who seemed to have a great many more teeth"|FALSE
836|"in his smile than are usual, and he led them through crooked streets"|FALSE
836|"to the ranee's palace. I am not going to describe the ranee's palace,"|FALSE
836|"because I really have never seen the palace of a ranee, and Mr Kipling"|FALSE
836|"has. So you can read about it in his books. But I know exactly what"|FALSE
836|"happened there."|FALSE
836|"The old ranee sat on a low-cushioned seat, and there were a lot of other"|FALSE
836|"ladies with her--all in trousers and veils, and sparkling with tinsel"|FALSE
836|"and gold and jewels. And the brown, turbaned gentleman stood behind a"|FALSE
836|"sort of carved screen, and interpreted what the children said and what"|FALSE
836|"the queen said. And when the queen asked to buy the carpet, the children"|FALSE
836|"said 'No.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why?' asked the ranee."|FALSE
836|"And Jane briefly said why, and the interpreter interpreted. The queen"|FALSE
836|"spoke, and then the interpreter said--"|FALSE
836|"'My mistress says it is a good story, and you tell it all through"|FALSE
836|"without thought of time.'"|FALSE
836|"And they had to. It made a long story, especially as it had all to be"|FALSE
836|"told twice--once by Cyril and once by the interpreter. Cyril rather"|FALSE
836|"enjoyed himself. He warmed to his work, and told the tale of the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"and the Carpet, and the Lone Tower, and the Queen-Cook, in language that"|FALSE
836|"grew insensibly more and more Arabian Nightsy, and the ranee and her"|FALSE
836|"ladies listened to the interpreter, and rolled about on their fat"|FALSE
836|"cushions with laughter."|FALSE
836|"When the story was ended she spoke, and the interpreter explained that"|FALSE
836|"she had said, 'Little one, thou art a heaven-born teller of tales,' and"|FALSE
836|"she threw him a string of turquoises from round her neck."|FALSE
836|"'OH, how lovely!' cried Jane and Anthea."|FALSE
836|"Cyril bowed several times, and then cleared his throat and said--"|FALSE
836|"'Thank her very, very much; but I would much rather she gave me some of"|FALSE
836|"the cheap things in the bazaar. Tell her I want them to sell again, and"|FALSE
836|"give the money to buy clothes for poor people who haven't any.'"|FALSE
836|"'Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with its"|FALSE
836|"price,' said the queen, when this was translated."|FALSE
836|"But Cyril said very firmly, 'No, thank you. The things have got to be"|FALSE
836|"sold to-day at our bazaar, and no one would buy a turquoise necklace at"|FALSE
836|"an English bazaar. They'd think it was sham, or else they'd want to know"|FALSE
836|"where we got it.'"|FALSE
836|"So then the queen sent out for little pretty things, and her servants"|FALSE
836|"piled the carpet with them."|FALSE
836|"'I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away,' she said,"|FALSE
836|"laughing."|FALSE
836|"But Anthea said, 'If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash our"|FALSE
836|"hands and faces, she shall see a magic thing. We and the carpet and all"|FALSE
836|"these brass trays and pots and carved things and stuffs and things will"|FALSE
836|"just vanish away like smoke.'"|FALSE
836|"The queen clapped her hands at this idea, and lent the children a"|FALSE
836|"sandal-wood comb inlaid with ivory lotus-flowers. And they washed their"|FALSE
836|"faces and hands in silver basins. Then Cyril made a very polite farewell"|FALSE
836|"speech, and quite suddenly he ended with the words--"|FALSE
836|"'And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools.'"|FALSE
836|"And of course they were. And the queen and her ladies were left with"|FALSE
836|"their mouths open, gazing at the bare space on the inlaid marble floor"|FALSE
836|"where the carpet and the children had been."|FALSE
836|"'That is magic, if ever magic was!' said the queen, delighted with the"|FALSE
836|"incident; which, indeed, has given the ladies of that court something to"|FALSE
836|"talk about on wet days ever since."|FALSE
836|"Cyril's stories had taken some time, so had the meal of strange sweet"|FALSE
836|"foods that they had had while the little pretty things were being"|FALSE
836|"bought, and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted. Outside, the"|FALSE
836|"winter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town houses."|FALSE
836|"'I'm glad we got washed in India,' said Cyril. 'We should have been"|FALSE
836|"awfully late if we'd had to go home and scrub.'"|FALSE
836|"'Besides,' Robert said, 'it's much warmer washing in India. I shouldn't"|FALSE
836|"mind it so much if we lived there.'"|FALSE
836|"The thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky space"|FALSE
836|"behind the point where the corners of two stalls met. The floor was"|FALSE
836|"littered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes were heaped"|FALSE
836|"along the wall."|FALSE
836|"The children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts of"|FALSE
836|"table-covers and mats and things, embroidered beautifully by idle"|FALSE
836|"ladies with no real work to do. They got out at the end, displacing a"|FALSE
836|"sideboard-cloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of blue geraniums. The"|FALSE
836|"girls got out unobserved, so did Cyril; but Robert, as he cautiously"|FALSE
836|"emerged, was actually walked on by Mrs Biddle, who kept the stall. Her"|FALSE
836|"large, solid foot stood firmly on the small, solid hand of Robert and"|FALSE
836|"who can blame Robert if he DID yell a little?"|FALSE
836|"A crowd instantly collected. Yells are very unusual at bazaars, and"|FALSE
836|"every one was intensely interested. It was several seconds before the"|FALSE
836|"three free children could make Mrs Biddle understand that what she"|FALSE
836|"was walking on was not a schoolroom floor, or even, as she presently"|FALSE
836|"supposed, a dropped pin-cushion, but the living hand of a suffering"|FALSE
836|"child. When she became aware that she really had hurt him, she grew very"|FALSE
836|"angry indeed. When people have hurt other people by accident, the one"|FALSE
836|"who does the hurting is always much the angriest. I wonder why."|FALSE
836|"'I'm very sorry, I'm sure,' said Mrs Biddle; but she spoke more in anger"|FALSE
836|"than in sorrow. 'Come out! whatever do you mean by creeping about under"|FALSE
836|"the stalls, like earwigs?'"|FALSE
836|"'We were looking at the things in the corner.'"|FALSE
836|"'Such nasty, prying ways,' said Mrs Biddle, 'will never make you"|FALSE
836|"successful in life. There's nothing there but packing and dust.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, isn't there!' said Jane. 'That's all you know.'"|FALSE
836|"'Little girl, don't be rude,' said Mrs Biddle, flushing violet."|FALSE
836|"'She doesn't mean to be; but there ARE some nice things there, all the"|FALSE
836|"same,' said Cyril; who suddenly felt how impossible it was to inform the"|FALSE
836|"listening crowd that all the treasures piled on the carpet were mother's"|FALSE
836|"contributions to the bazaar. No one would believe it; and if they did,"|FALSE
836|"and wrote to thank mother, she would think--well, goodness only knew"|FALSE
836|"what she would think. The other three children felt the same."|FALSE
836|"'I should like to see them,' said a very nice lady, whose friends"|FALSE
836|"had disappointed her, and who hoped that these might be belated"|FALSE
836|"contributions to her poorly furnished stall."|FALSE
836|"She looked inquiringly at Robert, who said, 'With pleasure, don't"|FALSE
836|"mention it,' and dived back under Mrs Biddle's stall."|FALSE
836|"'I wonder you encourage such behaviour,' said Mrs Biddle. 'I always"|FALSE
836|"speak my mind, as you know, Miss Peasmarsh; and, I must say, I am"|FALSE
836|"surprised.' She turned to the crowd. 'There is no entertainment here,'"|FALSE
836|"she said sternly. 'A very naughty little boy has accidentally hurt"|FALSE
836|"himself, but only slightly. Will you please disperse? It will only"|FALSE
836|"encourage him in naughtiness if he finds himself the centre of"|FALSE
836|"attraction.'"|FALSE
836|"The crowd slowly dispersed. Anthea, speechless with fury, heard a nice"|FALSE
836|"curate say, 'Poor little beggar!' and loved the curate at once and for"|FALSE
836|"ever."|FALSE
836|"Then Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares brass"|FALSE
836|"and some inlaid sandalwood boxes."|FALSE
836|"'Liberty!' cried Miss Peasmarsh. 'Then Charles has not forgotten, after"|FALSE
836|"all.'"|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said Mrs Biddle, with fierce politeness, 'these objects are"|FALSE
836|"deposited behind MY stall. Some unknown donor who does good by stealth,"|FALSE
836|"and would blush if he could hear you claim the things. Of course they"|FALSE
836|"are for me.'"|FALSE
836|"'My stall touches yours at the corner,' said poor Miss Peasmarsh,"|FALSE
836|"timidly, 'and my cousin did promise--'"|FALSE
836|"The children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled with"|FALSE
836|"the crowd. Their feelings were too deep for words--till at last Robert"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'That stiff-starched PIG!'"|FALSE
836|"'And after all our trouble! I'm hoarse with gassing to that trousered"|FALSE
836|"lady in India.'"|FALSE
836|"'The pig-lady's very, very nasty,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"It was Anthea who said, in a hurried undertone, 'She isn't very nice,"|FALSE
836|"and Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too. Who's got a pencil?'"|FALSE
836|"It was a long crawl, under three stalls, but Anthea did it. A large"|FALSE
836|"piece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner."|FALSE
836|"She folded it to a square and wrote upon it, licking the pencil at every"|FALSE
836|"word to make it mark quite blackly: 'All these Indian things are for"|FALSE
836|"pretty, nice Miss Peasmarsh's stall.' She thought of adding, 'There is"|FALSE
836|"nothing for Mrs Biddle;' but she saw that this might lead to suspicion,"|FALSE
836|"so she wrote hastily: 'From an unknown donna,' and crept back among the"|FALSE
836|"boards and trestles to join the others."|FALSE
836|"So that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee, and the corner"|FALSE
836|"of the stall was lifted and shifted, so that stout clergymen and heavy"|FALSE
836|"ladies could get to the corner without creeping under stalls, the blue"|FALSE
836|"paper was discovered, and all the splendid, shining Indian things were"|FALSE
836|"given over to Miss Peasmarsh, and she sold them all, and got thirty-five"|FALSE
836|"pounds for them."|FALSE
836|"'I don't understand about that blue paper,' said Mrs Biddle. 'It looks"|FALSE
836|"to me like the work of a lunatic. And saying you were nice and pretty!"|FALSE
836|"It's not the work of a sane person.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea and Jane begged Miss Peasmarsh to let them help her to sell the"|FALSE
836|"things, because it was their brother who had announced the good news"|FALSE
836|"that the things had come. Miss Peasmarsh was very willing, for now her"|FALSE
836|"stall, that had been SO neglected, was surrounded by people who wanted"|FALSE
836|"to buy, and she was glad to be helped. The children noted that Mrs"|FALSE
836|"Biddle had not more to do in the way of selling than she could manage"|FALSE
836|"quite well. I hope they were not glad--for you should forgive your"|FALSE
836|"enemies, even if they walk on your hands and then say it is all your"|FALSE
836|"naughty fault. But I am afraid they were not so sorry as they ought to"|FALSE
836|"have been."|FALSE
836|"It took some time to arrange the things on the stall. The carpet was"|FALSE
836|"spread over it, and the dark colours showed up the brass and silver and"|FALSE
836|"ivory things. It was a happy and busy afternoon, and when Miss Peasmarsh"|FALSE
836|"and the girls had sold every single one of the little pretty things from"|FALSE
836|"the Indian bazaar, far, far away, Anthea and Jane went off with the"|FALSE
836|"boys to fish in the fishpond, and dive into the bran-pie, and hear the"|FALSE
836|"cardboard band, and the phonograph, and the chorus of singing birds that"|FALSE
836|"was done behind a screen with glass tubes and glasses of water."|FALSE
836|"They had a beautiful tea, suddenly presented to them by the nice curate,"|FALSE
836|"and Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more than three cakes"|FALSE
836|"each. It was a merry party, and the curate was extremely pleasant to"|FALSE
836|"every one, 'even to Miss Peasmarsh,' as Jane said afterwards."|FALSE
836|"'We ought to get back to the stall,' said Anthea, when no one could"|FALSE
836|"possibly eat any more, and the curate was talking in a low voice to Miss"|FALSE
836|"Peas marsh about 'after Easter'."|FALSE
836|"'There's nothing to go back for,' said Miss Peasmarsh gaily; 'thanks to"|FALSE
836|"you dear children we've sold everything.'"|FALSE
836|"'There--there's the carpet,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'Oh,' said Miss Peasmarsh, radiantly, 'don't bother about the carpet."|FALSE
836|"I've sold even that. Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for it. She said"|FALSE
836|"it would do for her servant's bedroom.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why,' said Jane, 'her servants don't HAVE carpets. We had cook from"|FALSE
836|"her, and she told us so.'"|FALSE
836|"'No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, if YOU please,' said the curate,"|FALSE
836|"cheerfully; and Miss Peasmarsh laughed, and looked at him as though she"|FALSE
836|"had never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing. But the others were"|FALSE
836|"struck dumb. How could they say, 'The carpet is ours!' For who brings"|FALSE
836|"carpets to bazaars?"|FALSE
836|"The children were now thoroughly wretched. But I am glad to say that"|FALSE
836|"their wretchedness did not make them forget their manners, as it does"|FALSE
836|"sometimes, even with grown-up people, who ought to know ever so much"|FALSE
836|"better."|FALSE
836|"They said, 'Thank you very much for the jolly tea,' and 'Thanks for"|FALSE
836|"being so jolly,' and 'Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly time;'"|FALSE
836|"for the curate had stood fish-ponds, and bran-pies, and phonographs, and"|FALSE
836|"the chorus of singing birds, and had stood them like a man. The girls"|FALSE
836|"hugged Miss Peasmarsh, and as they went away they heard the curate say--"|FALSE
836|"'Jolly little kids, yes, but what about--you will let it be directly"|FALSE
836|"after Easter. Ah, do say you will--'"|FALSE
836|"And Jane ran back and said, before Anthea could drag her away, 'What are"|FALSE
836|"you going to do after Easter?'"|FALSE
836|"Miss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed. And the curate"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Thank you,' said the curate, 'but I'm afraid I can't wait for that. I"|FALSE
836|"must go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a bishop. I should"|FALSE
836|"have no time afterwards.'"|FALSE
836|"'I've always thought I should marry a bishop,' said Jane: 'his aprons"|FALSE
836|"would come in so useful. Wouldn't YOU like to marry a bishop, Miss"|FALSE
836|"Peasmarsh?'"|FALSE
836|"It was then that they dragged her away."|FALSE
836|"As it was Robert's hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on, it was decided"|FALSE
836|"that he had better not recall the incident to her mind, and so make"|FALSE
836|"her angry again. Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things at the rival"|FALSE
836|"stall, so they were not likely to be popular."|FALSE
836|"A hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril less"|FALSE
836|"than she would hate the others, so the others mingled with the crowd,"|FALSE
836|"and it was he who said to her--"|FALSE
836|"'Mrs Biddle, WE meant to have that carpet. Would you sell it to us? We"|FALSE
836|"would give you--'"|FALSE
836|"'Certainly not,' said Mrs Biddle. 'Go away, little boy.'"|FALSE
836|"There was that in her tone which showed Cyril, all too plainly, the"|FALSE
836|"hopelessness of persuasion. He found the others and said--"|FALSE
836|"'It's no use; she's like a lioness robbed of its puppies. We must watch"|FALSE
836|"where it goes--and--Anthea, I don't care what you say. It's our own"|FALSE
836|"carpet. It wouldn't be burglary. It would be a sort of forlorn hope"|FALSE
836|"rescue party--heroic and daring and dashing, and not wrong at all.'"|FALSE
836|"The children still wandered among the gay crowd--but there was no"|FALSE
836|"pleasure there for them any more. The chorus of singing birds sounded"|FALSE
836|"just like glass tubes being blown through water, and the phonograph"|FALSE
836|"simply made a horrid noise, so that you could hardly hear yourself"|FALSE
836|"speak. And the people were buying things they couldn't possibly want,"|FALSE
836|"and it all seemed very stupid. And Mrs Biddle had bought the wishing"|FALSE
836|"carpet for ten shillings. And the whole of life was sad and grey and"|FALSE
836|"dusty, and smelt of slight gas escapes, and hot people, and cake and"|FALSE
836|"crumbs, and all the children were very tired indeed."|FALSE
836|"They found a corner within sight of the carpet, and there they waited"|FALSE
836|"miserably, till it was far beyond their proper bedtime. And when it was"|FALSE
836|"ten the people who had bought things went away, but the people who had"|FALSE
836|"been selling stayed to count up their money."|FALSE
836|"'And to jaw about it,' said Robert. 'I'll never go to another bazaar as"|FALSE
836|"long as ever I live. My hand is swollen as big as a pudding. I expect"|FALSE
836|"the nails in her horrible boots were poisoned.'"|FALSE
836|"Just then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said--"|FALSE
836|"'Everything is over now; you had better go home.'"|FALSE
836|"So they went. And then they waited on the pavement under the gas lamp,"|FALSE
836|"where ragged children had been standing all the evening to listen to"|FALSE
836|"the band, and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud till Mrs Biddle"|FALSE
836|"came out and was driven away in a cab with the many things she hadn't"|FALSE
836|"sold, and the few things she had bought--among others the carpet. The"|FALSE
836|"other stall-holders left their things at the school till Monday morning,"|FALSE
836|"but Mrs Biddle was afraid some one would steal some of them, so she took"|FALSE
836|"them in a cab."|FALSE
836|"The children, now too desperate to care for mud or appearances, hung"|FALSE
836|"on behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddle's house. When she and the"|FALSE
836|"carpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said--"|FALSE
836|"'Don't let's burgle--I mean do daring and dashing rescue acts--till"|FALSE
836|"we've given her a chance. Let's ring and ask to see her.'"|FALSE
836|"The others hated to do this, but at last they agreed, on condition that"|FALSE
836|"Anthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary afterwards, if"|FALSE
836|"it really had to come to that."|FALSE
836|"So they knocked and rang, and a scared-looking parlourmaid opened the"|FALSE
836|"front door. While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw her. She was"|FALSE
836|"in the dining-room, and she had already pushed back the table and spread"|FALSE
836|"out the carpet to see how it looked on the floor."|FALSE
836|"'I knew she didn't want it for her servants' bedroom,' Jane muttered."|FALSE
836|"Anthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid, and the"|FALSE
836|"others followed her. Mrs Biddle had her back to them, and was smoothing"|FALSE
836|"down the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on the hand"|FALSE
836|"of Robert. So that they were all in the room, and Cyril, with great"|FALSE
836|"presence of mind, had shut the room door before she saw them."|FALSE
836|"'Who is it, Jane?' she asked in a sour voice; and then turning suddenly,"|FALSE
836|"she saw who it was. Once more her face grew violet--a deep, dark violet."|FALSE
836|"'You wicked daring little things!' she cried, 'how dare you come here?"|FALSE
836|"At this time of night, too. Be off, or I'll send for the police.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't be angry,' said Anthea, soothingly, 'we only wanted to ask you"|FALSE
836|"to let us have the carpet. We have quite twelve shillings between us,"|FALSE
836|"and--'"|FALSE
836|"'How DARE you?' cried Mrs Biddle, and her voice shook with angriness."|FALSE
836|"'You do look horrid,' said Jane suddenly."|FALSE
836|"Mrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers. 'You rude,"|FALSE
836|"barefaced child!' she said."|FALSE
836|"Anthea almost shook Jane; but Jane pushed forward in spite of her."|FALSE
836|"'It really IS our nursery carpet,' she said, 'you ask ANY ONE if it"|FALSE
836|"isn't.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let's wish ourselves home,' said Cyril in a whisper."|FALSE
836|"'No go,' Robert whispered back, 'she'd be there too, and raving mad as"|FALSE
836|"likely as not. Horrid thing, I hate her!'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper,' cried Anthea,"|FALSE
836|"suddenly. 'It's worth trying,' she said to herself."|FALSE
836|"Mrs Biddle's face grew from purple to violet, and from violet to mauve,"|FALSE
836|"and from mauve to pink. Then she smiled quite a jolly smile."|FALSE
836|"'Why, so I am!' she said, 'what a funny idea! Why shouldn't I be in a"|FALSE
836|"good temper, my dears.'"|FALSE
836|"Once more the carpet had done its work, and not on Mrs Biddle alone. The"|FALSE
836|"children felt suddenly good and happy."|FALSE
836|"'You're a jolly good sort,' said Cyril. 'I see that now. I'm sorry we"|FALSE
836|"vexed you at the bazaar to-day.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not another word,' said the changed Mrs Biddle. 'Of course you shall"|FALSE
836|"have the carpet, my dears, if you've taken such a fancy to it. No, no; I"|FALSE
836|"won't have more than the ten shillings I paid.'"|FALSE
836|"'It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the bazaar,'"|FALSE
836|"said Anthea; 'but it really IS our nursery carpet. It got to the bazaar"|FALSE
836|"by mistake, with some other things.'"|FALSE
836|"'Did it really, now? How vexing!' said Mrs Biddle, kindly. 'Well, my"|FALSE
836|"dears, I can very well give the extra ten shillings; so you take your"|FALSE
836|"carpet and we'll say no more about it. Have a piece of cake before you"|FALSE
836|"go! I'm so sorry I stepped on your hand, my boy. Is it all right now?'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, thank you,' said Robert. 'I say, you ARE good.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not at all,' said Mrs Biddle, heartily. 'I'm delighted to be able to"|FALSE
836|"give any little pleasure to you dear children.'"|FALSE
836|"And she helped them to roll up the carpet, and the boys carried it away"|FALSE
836|"between them."|FALSE
836|"'You ARE a dear,' said Anthea, and she and Mrs Biddle kissed each other"|FALSE
836|"heartily."|FALSE
836|"'WELL!' said Cyril as they went along the street."|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Robert, 'and the odd part is that you feel just as if it"|FALSE
836|"was REAL--her being so jolly, I mean--and not only the carpet making her"|FALSE
836|"nice.'"|FALSE
836|"'Perhaps it IS real,' said Anthea, 'only it was covered up with"|FALSE
836|"crossness and tiredness and things, and the carpet took them away.'"|FALSE
836|"'I hope it'll keep them away,' said Jane; 'she isn't ugly at all when"|FALSE
836|"she laughs.'"|FALSE
836|"The carpet has done many wonders in its day; but the case of Mrs"|FALSE
836|"Biddle is, I think, the most wonderful. For from that day she was never"|FALSE
836|"anything like so disagreeable as she was before, and she sent a lovely"|FALSE
836|"silver tea-pot and a kind letter to Miss Peasmarsh when the pretty lady"|FALSE
836|"married the nice curate; just after Easter it was, and they went to"|FALSE

836|"'No, I'm not; only the carpet never says anything, and it's so helpless."|FALSE
836|"It doesn't seem able to take care of itself. It gets sold, and taken"|FALSE
836|"into the sea, and things like that. You wouldn't catch the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"getting sold.'"|FALSE
836|"It was two days after the bazaar. Every one was a little cross--some"|FALSE
836|"days are like that, usually Mondays, by the way. And this was a Monday."|FALSE
836|"'I shouldn't wonder if your precious Phoenix had gone off for good,'"|FALSE
836|"said Cyril; 'and I don't know that I blame it. Look at the weather!'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not worth looking at,' said Robert. And indeed it wasn't."|FALSE
836|"'The Phoenix hasn't gone--I'm sure it hasn't,' said Anthea. 'I'll have"|FALSE
836|"another look for it.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea looked under tables and chairs, and in boxes and baskets, in"|FALSE
836|"mother's work-bag and father's portmanteau, but still the Phoenix showed"|FALSE
836|"not so much as the tip of one shining feather."|FALSE
836|"Then suddenly Robert remembered how the whole of the Greek invocation"|FALSE
836|"song of seven thousand lines had been condensed by him into one English"|FALSE
836|"hexameter, so he stood on the carpet and chanted--"|FALSE
836|"  'Oh, come along, come along, you good old beautiful Phoenix,'"|FALSE
836|"and almost at once there was a rustle of wings down the kitchen stairs,"|FALSE
836|"and the Phoenix sailed in on wide gold wings."|FALSE
836|"'Where on earth HAVE you been?' asked Anthea. 'I've looked everywhere"|FALSE
836|"for you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not EVERYWHERE,' replied the bird, 'because you did not look in the"|FALSE
836|"place where I was. Confess that that hallowed spot was overlooked by"|FALSE
836|"you.'"|FALSE
836|"'WHAT hallowed spot?' asked Cyril, a little impatiently, for time was"|FALSE
836|"hastening on, and the wishing carpet still idle."|FALSE
836|"'The spot,' said the Phoenix, 'which I hallowed by my golden presence"|FALSE
836|"was the Lutron.'"|FALSE
836|"'The WHAT?'"|FALSE
836|"'The bath--the place of washing.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm sure you weren't,' said Jane. 'I looked there three times and moved"|FALSE
836|"all the towels.'"|FALSE
836|"'I was concealed,' said the Phoenix, 'on the summit of a metal"|FALSE
836|"column--enchanted, I should judge, for it felt warm to my golden toes,"|FALSE
836|"as though the glorious sun of the desert shone ever upon it.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, you mean the cylinder,' said Cyril: 'it HAS rather a comforting"|FALSE
836|"feel, this weather. And now where shall we go?'"|FALSE
836|"And then, of course, the usual discussion broke out as to where they"|FALSE
836|"should go and what they should do. And naturally, every one wanted to do"|FALSE
836|"something that the others did not care about."|FALSE
836|"'I am the eldest,' Cyril remarked, 'let's go to the North Pole.'"|FALSE
836|"'This weather! Likely!' Robert rejoined. 'Let's go to the Equator.'"|FALSE
836|"'I think the diamond mines of Golconda would be nice,' said Anthea;"|FALSE
836|"'don't you agree, Jane?'"|FALSE
836|"'No, I don't,' retorted Jane, 'I don't agree with you. I don't agree"|FALSE
836|"with anybody.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix raised a warning claw."|FALSE
836|"'If you cannot agree among yourselves, I fear I shall have to leave"|FALSE
836|"you,' it said."|FALSE
836|"'Well, where shall we go? You decide!' said all."|FALSE
836|"'If I were you,' said the bird, thoughtfully, 'I should give the carpet"|FALSE
836|"a rest. Besides, you'll lose the use of your legs if you go everywhere"|FALSE
836|"by carpet. Can't you take me out and explain your ugly city to me?'"|FALSE
836|"'We will if it clears up,' said Robert, without enthusiasm. 'Just look"|FALSE
836|"at the rain. And why should we give the carpet a rest?'"|FALSE
836|"'Are you greedy and grasping, and heartless and selfish?' asked the"|FALSE
836|"bird, sharply."|FALSE
836|"'NO!' said Robert, with indignation."|FALSE
836|"'Well then!' said the Phoenix. 'And as to the rain--well, I am not fond"|FALSE
836|"of rain myself. If the sun knew _I_ was here--he's very fond of shining"|FALSE
836|"on me because I look so bright and golden. He always says I repay a"|FALSE

836|"weather?'"|FALSE
836|"'There's \"Rain, rain, go away,\"' said Anthea; 'but it never DOES go.'"|FALSE

836|"     Come again another day,"|FALSE
836|"     Little baby wants to play,'"|FALSE
836|"said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'That's quite wrong; and if you say it in that sort of dull way, I can"|FALSE

836|"     'Rain, rain, go away,"|FALSE
836|"     Come again another day;"|FALSE
836|"     Now we want the sun, and so,"|FALSE
836|"     Pretty rain, be kind and go!"|FALSE
836|"'You should always speak politely to people when you want them to do"|FALSE
836|"things, and especially when it's going away that you want them to do."|FALSE
836|"And to-day you might add--"|FALSE
836|"     'Shine, great sun, the lovely Phoe-"|FALSE
836|"     Nix is here, and wants to be"|FALSE
836|"     Shone on, splendid sun, by thee!'"|FALSE
836|"'That's poetry!' said Cyril, decidedly."|FALSE
836|"'It's like it,' said the more cautious Robert."|FALSE
836|"'I was obliged to put in \"lovely\",' said the Phoenix, modestly, 'to make"|FALSE
836|"the line long enough.'"|FALSE
836|"'There are plenty of nasty words just that length,' said Jane; but every"|FALSE
836|"one else said 'Hush!' And then they opened the window and shouted the"|FALSE
836|"seven lines as loud as they could, and the Phoenix said all the words"|FALSE
836|"with them, except 'lovely', and when they came to that it looked down"|FALSE
836|"and coughed bashfully."|FALSE
836|"The rain hesitated a moment and then went away."|FALSE
836|"'There's true politeness,' said the Phoenix, and the next moment it was"|FALSE
836|"perched on the window-ledge, opening and shutting its radiant wings and"|FALSE
836|"flapping out its golden feathers in such a flood of glorious sunshine as"|FALSE
836|"you sometimes have at sunset in autumn time. People said afterwards that"|FALSE
836|"there had not been such sunshine in December for years and years and"|FALSE
836|"years."|FALSE
836|"'And now,' said the bird, 'we will go out into the city, and you shall"|FALSE
836|"take me to see one of my temples.'"|FALSE
836|"'Your temples?'"|FALSE
836|"'I gather from the carpet that I have many temples in this land.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't see how you CAN find anything out from it,' said Jane: 'it"|FALSE
836|"never speaks.'"|FALSE
836|"'All the same, you can pick up things from a carpet,' said the bird;"|FALSE
836|"'I've seen YOU do it. And I have picked up several pieces of information"|FALSE
836|"in this way. That papyrus on which you showed me my picture--I"|FALSE
836|"understand that it bears on it the name of the street of your city in"|FALSE
836|"which my finest temple stands, with my image graved in stone and in"|FALSE
836|"metal over against its portal.'"|FALSE
836|"'You mean the fire insurance office,' said Robert. 'It's not really a"|FALSE
836|"temple, and they don't--'"|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' said the Phoenix, coldly, 'you are wholly misinformed. It"|FALSE
836|"IS a temple, and they do.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't let's waste the sunshine,' said Anthea; 'we might argue as we go"|FALSE
836|"along, to save time.'"|FALSE
836|"So the Phoenix consented to make itself a nest in the breast of Robert's"|FALSE
836|"Norfolk jacket, and they all went out into the splendid sunshine. The"|FALSE
836|"best way to the temple of the Phoenix seemed to be to take the tram, and"|FALSE
836|"on the top of it the children talked, while the Phoenix now and then"|FALSE
836|"put out a wary beak, cocked a cautious eye, and contradicted what the"|FALSE
836|"children were saying."|FALSE
836|"It was a delicious ride, and the children felt how lucky they were to"|FALSE
836|"have had the money to pay for it. They went with the tram as far as it"|FALSE
836|"went, and when it did not go any farther they stopped too, and got off."|FALSE
836|"The tram stops at the end of the Gray's Inn Road, and it was Cyril"|FALSE
836|"who thought that one might well find a short cut to the Phoenix Office"|FALSE
836|"through the little streets and courts that lie tightly packed between"|FALSE
836|"Fetter Lane and Ludgate Circus. Of course, he was quite mistaken, as"|FALSE
836|"Robert told him at the time, and afterwards Robert did not forbear to"|FALSE
836|"remind his brother how he had said so. The streets there were small"|FALSE
836|"and stuffy and ugly, and crowded with printers' boys and binders' girls"|FALSE
836|"coming out from work; and these stared so hard at the pretty red coats"|FALSE
836|"and caps of the sisters that they wished they had gone some other way."|FALSE
836|"And the printers and binders made very personal remarks, advising Jane"|FALSE
836|"to get her hair cut, and inquiring where Anthea had bought that hat."|FALSE
836|"Jane and Anthea scorned to reply, and Cyril and Robert found that they"|FALSE
836|"were hardly a match for the rough crowd. They could think of nothing"|FALSE
836|"nasty enough to say. They turned a corner sharply, and then Anthea"|FALSE
836|"pulled Jane into an archway, and then inside a door; Cyril and Robert"|FALSE
836|"quickly followed, and the jeering crowd passed by without seein them."|FALSE
836|"Anthea drew a long breath."|FALSE
836|"'How awful!' she said. 'I didn't know there were such people, except in"|FALSE
836|"books.'"|FALSE
836|"'It was a bit thick; but it's partly you girls' fault, coming out in"|FALSE
836|"those flashy coats.'"|FALSE
836|"'We thought we ought to, when we were going out with the Phoenix,' said"|FALSE
836|"Jane; and the bird said, 'Quite right, too'--and incautiously put out"|FALSE
836|"his head to give her a wink of encouragement."|FALSE
836|"And at the same instant a dirty hand reached through the grim balustrade"|FALSE
836|"of the staircase beside them and clutched the Phoenix, and a hoarse"|FALSE
836|"voice said--"|FALSE
836|"'I say, Urb, blowed if this ain't our Poll parrot what we lost. Thank"|FALSE
836|"you very much, lidy, for bringin' 'im home to roost.'"|FALSE
836|"The four turned swiftly. Two large and ragged boys were crouched amid"|FALSE
836|"the dark shadows of the stairs. They were much larger than Robert and"|FALSE
836|"Cyril, and one of them had snatched the Phoenix away and was holding it"|FALSE
836|"high above their heads."|FALSE
836|"'Give me that bird,' said Cyril, sternly: 'it's ours.'"|FALSE
836|"'Good arternoon, and thankin' you,' the boy went on, with maddening"|FALSE
836|"mockery. 'Sorry I can't give yer tuppence for yer trouble--but I've"|FALSE
836|"'ad to spend my fortune advertising for my vallyable bird in all the"|FALSE
836|"newspapers. You can call for the reward next year.'"|FALSE
836|"'Look out, Ike,' said his friend, a little anxiously; 'it 'ave a beak on"|FALSE
836|"it.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's other parties as'll have the Beak on to 'em presently,' said Ike,"|FALSE
836|"darkly, 'if they come a-trying to lay claims on my Poll parrot. You just"|FALSE
836|"shut up, Urb. Now then, you four little gells, get out er this.'"|FALSE
836|"'Little girls!' cried Robert. 'I'll little girl you!'"|FALSE
836|"He sprang up three stairs and hit out."|FALSE
836|"There was a squawk--the most bird-like noise any one had ever heard"|FALSE
836|"from the Phoenix--and a fluttering, and a laugh in the darkness, and Ike"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'There now, you've been and gone and strook my Poll parrot right in the"|FALSE
836|"fevvers--strook 'im something crool, you 'ave.'"|FALSE
836|"Robert stamped with fury. Cyril felt himself growing pale with rage,"|FALSE
836|"and with the effort of screwing up his brain to make it clever enough to"|FALSE
836|"think of some way of being even with those boys. Anthea and Jane were as"|FALSE
836|"angry as the boys, but it made them want to cry. Yet it was Anthea who"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'Do, PLEASE, let us have the bird.'"|FALSE
836|"'Dew, PLEASE, get along and leave us an' our bird alone.'"|FALSE
836|"'If you don't,' said Anthea, 'I shall fetch the police.'"|FALSE
836|"'You better!' said he who was named Urb. 'Say, Ike, you twist the"|FALSE
836|"bloomin' pigeon's neck; he ain't worth tuppence.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, no,' cried Jane, 'don't hurt it. Oh, don't; it is such a pet.'"|FALSE
836|"'I won't hurt it,' said Ike; 'I'm 'shamed of you, Urb, for to think of"|FALSE
836|"such a thing. Arf a shiner, miss, and the bird is yours for life.'"|FALSE
836|"'Half a WHAT?' asked Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Arf a shiner, quid, thick 'un--half a sov, then.'"|FALSE
836|"'I haven't got it--and, besides, it's OUR bird,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, don't talk to him,' said Cyril and then Jane said suddenly--"|FALSE
836|"'Phoenix--dear Phoenix, we can't do anything. YOU must manage it.'"|FALSE
836|"'With pleasure,' said the Phoenix--and Ike nearly dropped it in his"|FALSE
836|"amazement."|FALSE
836|"'I say, it do talk, suthin' like,' said he."|FALSE
836|"'Youths,' said the Phoenix, 'sons of misfortune, hear my words.'"|FALSE

836|"'Right O,' said Isaac."|FALSE
836|"'Forbear,' repeated the Phoenix, sternly. 'Who pinched the click off of"|FALSE

836|"'Who sneaked the nose-rag out of the young gell's 'and in Bell Court?"|FALSE
836|"Who--'"|FALSE
836|"'Stow it,' said Ike. 'You! ugh! yah!--leave go of me. Bash him off, Urb;"|FALSE
836|"'e'll have my bloomin' eyes outer my ed.'"|FALSE
836|"There were howls, a scuffle, a flutter; Ike and Urb fled up the stairs,"|FALSE
836|"and the Phoenix swept out through the doorway. The children followed and"|FALSE
836|"the Phoenix settled on Robert, 'like a butterfly on a rose,' as Anthea"|FALSE
836|"said afterwards, and wriggled into the breast of his Norfolk jacket,"|FALSE
836|"'like an eel into mud,' as Cyril later said."|FALSE
836|"'Why ever didn't you burn him? You could have, couldn't you?' asked"|FALSE
836|"Robert, when the hurried flight through the narrow courts had ended in"|FALSE
836|"the safe wideness of Farringdon Street."|FALSE
836|"'I could have, of course,' said the bird, 'but I didn't think it would"|FALSE
836|"be dignified to allow myself to get warm about a little thing like that."|FALSE
836|"The Fates, after all, have not been illiberal to me. I have a good many"|FALSE
836|"friends among the London sparrows, and I have a beak and claws.'"|FALSE
836|"These happenings had somewhat shaken the adventurous temper of the"|FALSE
836|"children, and the Phoenix had to exert its golden self to hearten them"|FALSE
836|"up."|FALSE
836|"Presently the children came to a great house in Lombard Street, and"|FALSE
836|"there, on each side of the door, was the image of the Phoenix carved in"|FALSE

836|"     PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE"|FALSE
836|"'One moment,' said the bird. 'Fire? For altars, I suppose?'"|FALSE
836|"'_I_ don't know,' said Robert; he was beginning to feel shy, and that"|FALSE
836|"always made him rather cross."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, yes, you do,' Cyril contradicted. 'When people's houses are burnt"|FALSE
836|"down the Phoenix gives them new houses. Father told me; I asked him.'"|FALSE

836|"priests dealt with the sons of men!'"|FALSE
836|"'The sons of men pay, you know,' said Anthea; 'but it's only a little"|FALSE
836|"every year.'"|FALSE
836|"'That is to maintain my priests,' said the bird, 'who, in the hour of"|FALSE

836|"you know,' Cyril explained. 'If they did the Phoenix wouldn't help them,"|FALSE
836|"because its a crime to set fire to things. Arsenic, or something they"|FALSE

836|"innermost sanctuary.'"|FALSE
836|"So the children went in, all four of them, though they didn't like it,"|FALSE
836|"and stood in a large and beautiful hall adorned with Doulton tiles,"|FALSE

836|"the children thought he was going to say, 'What can I have the pleasure"|FALSE
836|"of showing you?' like in a draper's; instead of which the young man"|FALSE
836|"said--"|FALSE
836|"'And what do YOU want?'"|FALSE
836|"'We want to see the High Priest.'"|FALSE
836|"'Get along with you,' said the young man."|FALSE
836|"An elder man, also decent in black coat, advanced."|FALSE
836|"'Perhaps it's Mr Blank' (not for worlds would I give the name). 'He's a"|FALSE
836|"Masonic High Priest, you know.'"|FALSE
836|"A porter was sent away to look for Mr Asterisk (I cannot give his name),"|FALSE
836|"and the children were left there to look on and be looked on by all"|FALSE
836|"the gentlemen at the mahogany desks. Anthea and Jane thought that they"|FALSE

836|"cheek."|FALSE
836|"The porter returned with the news that Mr Dot Dash Dot (I dare not"|FALSE
836|"reveal his name) was out, but that Mr--"|FALSE
836|"Here a really delightful gentleman appeared. He had a beard and a kind"|FALSE
836|"and merry eye, and each one of the four knew at once that this was a man"|FALSE
836|"who had kiddies of his own and could understand what you were talking"|FALSE
836|"about. Yet it was a difficult thing to explain."|FALSE
836|"'What is it?' he asked. 'Mr'--he named the name which I will never"|FALSE
836|"reveal--'is out. Can I do anything?'"|FALSE
836|"'Inner sanctuary,' murmured the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'I beg your pardon,' said the nice gentleman, who thought it was Robert"|FALSE
836|"who had spoken."|FALSE
836|"'We have something to tell you,' said Cyril, 'but'--he glanced at the"|FALSE
836|"porter, who was lingering much nearer than he need have done--'this is a"|FALSE
836|"very public place.'"|FALSE
836|"The nice gentleman laughed."|FALSE
836|"'Come upstairs then,' he said, and led the way up a wide and beautiful"|FALSE
836|"staircase. Anthea says the stairs were of white marble, but I am not"|FALSE
836|"sure. On the corner-post of the stairs, at the top, was a beautiful"|FALSE
836|"image of the Phoenix in dark metal, and on the wall at each side was a"|FALSE
836|"flat sort of image of it."|FALSE
836|"The nice gentleman led them into a room where the chairs, and even the"|FALSE

836|"inquiringly."|FALSE
836|"'Don't be frightened,' he said; 'tell me exactly what you want.'"|FALSE
836|"'May I shut the door?' asked Cyril."|FALSE
836|"The gentleman looked surprised, but he shut the door."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' said Cyril, firmly, 'I know you'll be awfully surprised, and"|FALSE
836|"you'll think it's not true and we are lunatics; but we aren't, and it"|FALSE
836|"is. Robert's got something inside his Norfolk--that's Robert, he's my"|FALSE
836|"young brother. Now don't be upset and have a fit or anything sir. Of"|FALSE
836|"course, I know when you called your shop the \"Phoenix\" you never thought"|FALSE
836|"there was one; but there is--and Robert's got it buttoned up against his"|FALSE
836|"chest!'"|FALSE
836|"'If it's an old curio in the form of a Phoenix, I dare say the Board--'"|FALSE
836|"said the nice gentleman, as Robert began to fumble with his buttons."|FALSE
836|"'It's old enough,' said Anthea, 'going by what it says, but--'"|FALSE
836|"'My goodness gracious!' said the gentleman, as the Phoenix, with one"|FALSE
836|"last wriggle that melted into a flutter, got out of its nest in the"|FALSE
836|"breast of Robert and stood up on the leather-covered table."|FALSE
836|"'What an extraordinarily fine bird!' he went on. 'I don't think I ever"|FALSE
836|"saw one just like it.'"|FALSE
836|"'I should think not,' said the Phoenix, with pardonable pride. And the"|FALSE
836|"gentleman jumped."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, it's been taught to speak! Some sort of parrot, perhaps?'"|FALSE
836|"'I am,' said the bird, simply, 'the Head of your House, and I have come"|FALSE
836|"to my temple to receive your homage. I am no parrot'--its beak curved"|FALSE
836|"scornfully--'I am the one and only Phoenix, and I demand the homage of"|FALSE
836|"my High Priest.'"|FALSE
836|"'In the absence of our manager,' the gentleman began, exactly as though"|FALSE
836|"he were addressing a valued customer--'in the absence of our manager, I"|FALSE
836|"might perhaps be able--What am I saying?' He turned pale, and passed"|FALSE
836|"his hand across his brow. 'My dears,' he said, 'the weather is unusually"|FALSE
836|"warm for the time of year, and I don't feel quite myself. Do you know,"|FALSE
836|"for a moment I really thought that that remarkable bird of yours had"|FALSE
836|"spoken and said it was the Phoenix, and, what's more, that I'd believed"|FALSE
836|"it.'"|FALSE
836|"'So it did, sir,' said Cyril, 'and so did you.'"|FALSE
836|"'It really--Allow me.'"|FALSE
836|"A bell was rung. The porter appeared."|FALSE
836|"'Mackenzie,' said the gentleman, 'you see that golden bird?'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, sir.'"|FALSE
836|"The other breathed a sigh of relief."|FALSE
836|"'It IS real, then?'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, sir, of course, sir. You take it in your hand, sir,' said the"|FALSE
836|"porter, sympathetically, and reached out his hand to the Phoenix, who"|FALSE
836|"shrank back on toes curved with agitated indignation."|FALSE
836|"'Forbear!' it cried; 'how dare you seek to lay hands on me?'"|FALSE
836|"The porter saluted."|FALSE
836|"'Beg pardon, sir,' he said, 'I thought you was a bird.'"|FALSE
836|"'I AM a bird--THE bird--the Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"'Of course you are, sir,' said the porter. 'I see that the first minute,"|FALSE
836|"directly I got my breath, sir.'"|FALSE
836|"'That will do,' said the gentleman. 'Ask Mr Wilson and Mr Sterry to step"|FALSE
836|"up here for a moment, please.'"|FALSE
836|"Mr Sterry and Mr Wilson were in their turn overcome by"|FALSE
836|"amazement--quickly followed by conviction. To the surprise of the"|FALSE
836|"children every one in the office took the Phoenix at its word, and after"|FALSE
836|"the first shock of surprise it seemed to be perfectly natural to every"|FALSE
836|"one that the Phoenix should be alive, and that, passing through London,"|FALSE
836|"it should call at its temple."|FALSE
836|"'We ought to have some sort of ceremony,' said the nicest"|FALSE
836|"gentleman, anxiously. 'There isn't time to summon the directors and"|FALSE
836|"shareholders--we might do that tomorrow, perhaps. Yes, the board-room"|FALSE
836|"would be best. I shouldn't like it to feel we hadn't done everything in"|FALSE
836|"our power to show our appreciation of its condescension in looking in on"|FALSE
836|"us in this friendly way.'"|FALSE
836|"The children could hardly believe their ears, for they had never thought"|FALSE
836|"that any one but themselves would believe in the Phoenix. And yet every"|FALSE
836|"one did; all the men in the office were brought in by twos and threes,"|FALSE
836|"and the moment the Phoenix opened its beak it convinced the cleverest"|FALSE
836|"of them, as well as those who were not so clever. Cyril wondered how the"|FALSE
836|"story would look in the papers next day. He seemed to see the posters in"|FALSE
836|"the streets:"|FALSE
836|"    PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE"|FALSE
836|"    THE PHOENIX AT ITS TEMPLE"|FALSE
836|"    MEETING TO WELCOME IT"|FALSE
836|"    DELIGHT OF THE MANAGER AND EVERYBODY."|FALSE
836|"'Excuse our leaving you a moment,' said the nice gentleman, and he went"|FALSE
836|"away with the others; and through the half-closed door the children"|FALSE
836|"could hear the sound of many boots on stairs, the hum of excited voices"|FALSE
836|"explaining, suggesting, arguing, the thumpy drag of heavy furniture"|FALSE
836|"being moved about."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix strutted up and down the leather-covered table, looking over"|FALSE
836|"its shoulder at its pretty back."|FALSE
836|"'You see what a convincing manner I have,' it said proudly."|FALSE
836|"And now a new gentleman came in and said, bowing low--"|FALSE
836|"'Everything is prepared--we have done our best at so short a notice; the"|FALSE
836|"meeting--the ceremony--will be in the board-room. Will the Honourable"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix walk--it is only a few steps--or would it like to be--would it"|FALSE
836|"like some sort of conveyance?'"|FALSE
836|"'My Robert will bear me to the board-room, if that be the unlovely name"|FALSE
836|"of my temple's inmost court,' replied the bird."|FALSE
836|"So they all followed the gentleman. There was a big table in the"|FALSE
836|"board-room, but it had been pushed right up under the long windows at"|FALSE
836|"one side, and chairs were arranged in rows across the room--like those"|FALSE
836|"you have at schools when there is a magic lantern on 'Our Eastern"|FALSE
836|"Empire', or on 'The Way We Do in the Navy'. The doors were of carved"|FALSE
836|"wood, very beautiful, with a carved Phoenix above. Anthea noticed that"|FALSE
836|"the chairs in the front rows were of the kind that her mother so loved"|FALSE
836|"to ask the price of in old furniture shops, and never could buy, because"|FALSE
836|"the price was always nearly twenty pounds each. On the mantelpiece were"|FALSE
836|"some heavy bronze candlesticks and a clock, and on the top of the clock"|FALSE
836|"was another image of the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Remove that effigy,' said the Phoenix to the gentlemen who were there,"|FALSE
836|"and it was hastily taken down. Then the Phoenix fluttered to the middle"|FALSE
836|"of the mantelpiece and stood there, looking more golden than ever. Then"|FALSE
836|"every one in the house and the office came in--from the cashier to the"|FALSE
836|"women who cooked the clerks' dinners in the beautiful kitchen at the top"|FALSE
836|"of the house. And every one bowed to the Phoenix and then sat down in a"|FALSE
836|"chair."|FALSE
836|"'Gentlemen,' said the nicest gentleman, 'we have met here today--'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix was turning its golden beak from side to side."|FALSE
836|"'I don't notice any incense,' it said, with an injured sniff. A hurried"|FALSE
836|"consultation ended in plates being fetched from the kitchen. Brown"|FALSE
836|"sugar, sealing-wax, and tobacco were placed on these, and something from"|FALSE
836|"a square bottle was poured over it all. Then a match was applied. It was"|FALSE
836|"the only incense that was handy in the Phoenix office, and it certainly"|FALSE
836|"burned very briskly and smoked a great deal."|FALSE
836|"'We have met here today,' said the gentleman again, 'on an occasion"|FALSE
836|"unparalleled in the annals of this office. Our respected Phoenix--'"|FALSE
836|"'Head of the House,' said the Phoenix, in a hollow voice."|FALSE
836|"'I was coming to that. Our respected Phoenix, the Head of this ancient"|FALSE
836|"House, has at length done us the honour to come among us. I think I may"|FALSE
836|"say, gentlemen, that we are not insensible to this honour, and that we"|FALSE
836|"welcome with no uncertain voice one whom we have so long desired to see"|FALSE
836|"in our midst.'"|FALSE
836|"Several of the younger clerks thought of saying 'Hear, hear,' but they"|FALSE
836|"feared it might seem disrespectful to the bird."|FALSE
836|"'I will not take up your time,' the speaker went on, 'by recapitulating"|FALSE
836|"the advantages to be derived from a proper use of our system of fire"|FALSE
836|"insurance. I know, and you know, gentlemen, that our aim has ever been"|FALSE
836|"to be worthy of that eminent bird whose name we bear, and who now adorns"|FALSE
836|"our mantelpiece with his presence. Three cheers, gentlemen, for the"|FALSE
836|"winged Head of the House!'"|FALSE
836|"The cheers rose, deafening. When they had died away the Phoenix was"|FALSE
836|"asked to say a few words."|FALSE
836|"It expressed in graceful phrases the pleasure it felt in finding itself"|FALSE
836|"at last in its own temple."|FALSE
836|"'And,' it went on, 'You must not think me wanting in appreciation of"|FALSE
836|"your very hearty and cordial reception when I ask that an ode may be"|FALSE
836|"recited or a choric song sung. It is what I have always been accustomed"|FALSE
836|"to.'"|FALSE
836|"The four children, dumb witnesses of this wonderful scene, glanced a"|FALSE
836|"little nervously across the foam of white faces above the sea of black"|FALSE
836|"coats. It seemed to them that the Phoenix was really asking a little too"|FALSE
836|"much."|FALSE
836|"'Time presses,' said the Phoenix, 'and the original ode of invocation is"|FALSE
836|"long, as well as being Greek; and, besides, it's no use invoking me when"|FALSE
836|"here I am; but is there not a song in your own tongue for a great day"|FALSE
836|"such as this?'"|FALSE
836|"Absently the manager began to sing, and one by one the rest joined--"|FALSE
836|"     'Absolute security!"|FALSE
836|"     No liability!"|FALSE
836|"     All kinds of property"|FALSE
836|"     insured against fire."|FALSE
836|"     Terms most favourable,"|FALSE
836|"     Expenses reasonable,"|FALSE
836|"     Moderate rates for annual"|FALSE
836|"     Insurance.'"|FALSE
836|"'That one is NOT my favourite,' interrupted the Phoenix, 'and I think"|FALSE
836|"you've forgotten part of it.'"|FALSE
836|"The manager hastily began another--"|FALSE
836|"     'O Golden Phoenix, fairest bird,"|FALSE
836|"     The whole great world has often heard"|FALSE
836|"     Of all the splendid things we do,"|FALSE
836|"     Great Phoenix, just to honour you.'"|FALSE
836|"'That's better,' said the bird. And every one sang--"|FALSE
836|"     'Class one, for private dwelling-house,"|FALSE
836|"     For household goods and shops allows;"|FALSE
836|"     Provided these are built of brick"|FALSE
836|"     Or stone, and tiled and slated thick.'"|FALSE
836|"'Try another verse,' said the Phoenix, 'further on.'"|FALSE
836|"And again arose the voices of all the clerks and employees and managers"|FALSE
836|"and secretaries and cooks--"|FALSE
836|"    'In Scotland our insurance yields"|FALSE
836|"     The price of burnt-up stacks in fields.'"|FALSE
836|"'Skip that verse,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"     'Thatched dwellings and their whole contents"|FALSE
836|"     We deal with--also with their rents;"|FALSE
836|"     Oh, glorious Phoenix, look and see"|FALSE
836|"     That these are dealt with in class three."|FALSE
836|"     'The glories of your temple throng"|FALSE
836|"     Too thick to go in any song;"|FALSE
836|"     And we attend, O good and wise,"|FALSE
836|"     To \"days of grace\" and merchandise."|FALSE
836|"     'When people's homes are burned away"|FALSE
836|"     They never have a cent to pay"|FALSE
836|"     If they have done as all should do,"|FALSE
836|"     O Phoenix, and have honoured you."|FALSE
836|"     'So let us raise our voice and sing"|FALSE
836|"     The praises of the Phoenix King."|FALSE
836|"     In classes one and two and three,"|FALSE
836|"     Oh, trust to him, for kind is he!'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm sure YOU'RE very kind,' said the Phoenix; 'and now we must be"|FALSE
836|"going. An thank you very much for a very pleasant time. May you all"|FALSE
836|"prosper as you deserve to do, for I am sure a nicer, pleasanter-spoken"|FALSE
836|"lot of temple attendants I have never met, and never wish to meet. I"|FALSE
836|"wish you all good-day!'"|FALSE
836|"It fluttered to the wrist of Robert and drew the four children from the"|FALSE
836|"room. The whole of the office staff followed down the wide stairs and"|FALSE
836|"filed into their accustomed places, and the two most important officials"|FALSE
836|"stood on the steps bowing till Robert had buttoned the golden bird in"|FALSE
836|"his Norfolk bosom, and it and he and the three other children were lost"|FALSE
836|"in the crowd."|FALSE
836|"The two most important gentlemen looked at each other earnestly and"|FALSE
836|"strangely for a moment, and then retreated to those sacred inner rooms,"|FALSE
836|"where they toil without ceasing for the good of the House."|FALSE
836|"And the moment they were all in their places--managers, secretaries,"|FALSE
836|"clerks, and porters--they all started, and each looked cautiously round"|FALSE
836|"to see if any one was looking at him. For each thought that he had"|FALSE
836|"fallen asleep for a few minutes, and had dreamed a very odd dream about"|FALSE
836|"the Phoenix and the board-room. And, of course, no one mentioned it"|FALSE
836|"to any one else, because going to sleep at your office is a thing you"|FALSE
836|"simply MUST NOT do."|FALSE
836|"The extraordinary confusion of the board-room, with the remains of the"|FALSE
836|"incense in the plates, would have shown them at once that the visit of"|FALSE
836|"the Phoenix had been no dream, but a radiant reality, but no one went"|FALSE
836|"into the board-room again that day; and next day, before the office"|FALSE
836|"was opened, it was all cleaned and put nice and tidy by a lady whose"|FALSE
836|"business asking questions was not part of. That is why Cyril read"|FALSE
836|"the papers in vain on the next day and the day after that; because no"|FALSE
836|"sensible person thinks his dreams worth putting in the paper, and no one"|FALSE
836|"will ever own that he has been asleep in the daytime."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix was very pleased, but it decided to write an ode for itself."|FALSE
836|"It thought the ones it had heard at its temple had been too hastily"|FALSE
836|"composed. Its own ode began--"|FALSE
836|"     'For beauty and for modest worth"|FALSE
836|"     The Phoenix has not its equal on earth.'"|FALSE
836|"And when the children went to bed that night it was still trying to cut"|FALSE
836|"down the last line to the proper length without taking out any of what"|FALSE
836|"it wanted to say."|FALSE
836|"That is what makes poetry so difficult."|FALSE
836|"CHAPTER 6. DOING GOOD"|FALSE
836|"'We shan't be able to go anywhere on the carpet for a whole week,"|FALSE
836|"though,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'And I'm glad of it,' said Jane, unexpectedly."|FALSE
836|"'Glad?' said Cyril; 'GLAD?'"|FALSE
836|"It was breakfast-time, and mother's letter, telling them how they were"|FALSE
836|"all going for Christmas to their aunt's at Lyndhurst, and how father and"|FALSE
836|"mother would meet them there, having been read by every one, lay on the"|FALSE

836|"'That's being a hardened criminal, father says,' put in Cyril, and he"|FALSE

836|"difference."|FALSE
836|"'We're going to-morrow, anyhow,' said Robert. 'Don't,' he added, with"|FALSE

836|"'Yes,' said Cyril, 'let's. It's not really wrong.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, look here,' said Anthea. 'You know there's something about"|FALSE

836|"'I don't mind,' said Cyril. 'We shan't know where we're going, and"|FALSE

836|"tea, please,' said Robert, 'and we should see the old man hide it away"|FALSE
836|"in the secret cupboard; and then, after long years, when the rightful"|FALSE
836|"heir was in despair, we should lead him to the hidden panel and--'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' interrupted Anthea; 'or we might be taken to some freezing garret"|FALSE
836|"in a German town, where a poor little pale, sick child--'"|FALSE
836|"'We haven't any German money,' interrupted Cyril, 'so THAT'S no go. What"|FALSE
836|"I should like would be getting into the middle of a war and getting hold"|FALSE

836|"When breakfast was cleared away, Anthea swept the carpet, and the"|FALSE

836|"Robert, with modest pride. 'I knew we should want them some day. I kept"|FALSE
836|"the secret well, didn't I?'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, yes,' said Cyril, with fine scorn. 'I found them the Sunday after,"|FALSE
836|"when I was feeling in your Norfolks for the knife you borrowed off me."|FALSE
836|"But I thought you'd only sneaked them for Chinese lanterns, or reading"|FALSE
836|"in bed by.'"|FALSE
836|"'Bobs,' said Anthea, suddenly, 'do you know where we are? This is"|FALSE
836|"the underground passage, and look there--there's the money and the"|FALSE
836|"money-bags, and everything.'"|FALSE
836|"By this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles, and"|FALSE

836|"'There's no one to do them to.'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't you be too sure,' said Cyril; 'just round the next turning we"|FALSE

836|"we could take him out on our carpet and restore him to his sorrowing"|FALSE
836|"friends.'"|FALSE
836|"'Of course we could,' said Robert, standing up and holding the candle"|FALSE
836|"above his head to see further off; 'or we might find the bones of a"|FALSE
836|"poor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried properly--that's"|FALSE
836|"always a kind action in books, though I never could see what bones"|FALSE
836|"matter.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish you wouldn't,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'I know exactly where we shall find the bones, too,' Robert went on."|FALSE
836|"'You see that dark arch just along the passage? Well, just inside"|FALSE
836|"there--'"|FALSE
836|"'If you don't stop going on like that,' said Jane, firmly, 'I shall"|FALSE
836|"scream, and then I'll faint--so now then!'"|FALSE
836|"'And _I_ will, too,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"Robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy."|FALSE
836|"'You girls will never be great writers,' he said bitterly. 'They just"|FALSE
836|"love to think of things in dungeons, and chains, and knobbly bare human"|FALSE
836|"bones, and--'"|FALSE
836|"Jane had opened her mouth to scream, but before she could decide how you"|FALSE
836|"began when you wanted to faint, the golden voice of the Phoenix spoke"|FALSE
836|"through the gloom."|FALSE
836|"'Peace!' it said; 'there are no bones here except the small but useful"|FALSE
836|"sets that you have inside you. And you did not invite me to come out"|FALSE
836|"with you to hear you talk about bones, but to see you do some good and"|FALSE
836|"kind action.'"|FALSE
836|"'We can't do it here,' said Robert, sulkily."|FALSE
836|"'No,' rejoined the bird. 'The only thing we can do here, it seems, is to"|FALSE
836|"try to frighten our little sisters.'"|FALSE
836|"'He didn't, really, and I'm not so VERY little,' said Jane, rather"|FALSE
836|"ungratefully."|FALSE
836|"Robert was silent. It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they had"|FALSE
836|"better take the money and go."|FALSE
836|"'That wouldn't be a kind act, except to ourselves; and it wouldn't be"|FALSE
836|"good, whatever way you look at it,' said Anthea, 'to take money that's"|FALSE
836|"not ours.'"|FALSE
836|"'We might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and aged,'"|FALSE
836|"said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'That wouldn't make it right to steal,' said Anthea, stoutly."|FALSE
836|"'I don't know,' said Cyril. They were all standing up now. 'Stealing is"|FALSE
836|"taking things that belong to some one else, and there's no one else.'"|FALSE
836|"'It can't be stealing if--'"|FALSE
836|"'That's right,' said Robert, with ironical approval; 'stand here all day"|FALSE
836|"arguing while the candles burn out. You'll like it awfully when it's all"|FALSE
836|"dark again--and bony.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let's get out, then,' said Anthea. 'We can argue as we go.' So they"|FALSE
836|"rolled up the carpet and went. But when they had crept along to the"|FALSE
836|"place where the passage led into the topless tower they found the way"|FALSE
836|"blocked by a great stone, which they could not move."|FALSE
836|"'There!' said Robert. 'I hope you're satisfied!'"|FALSE
836|"'Everything has two ends,' said the Phoenix, softly; 'even a quarrel or"|FALSE
836|"a secret passage.'"|FALSE
836|"So they turned round and went back, and Robert was made to go first with"|FALSE
836|"one of the candles, because he was the one who had begun to talk about"|FALSE
836|"bones. And Cyril carried the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'I wish you hadn't put bones into our heads,' said Jane, as they went"|FALSE
836|"along."|FALSE
836|"'I didn't; you always had them. More bones than brains,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"The passage was long, and there were arches and steps and turnings and"|FALSE
836|"dark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing. The passage ended"|FALSE
836|"in a flight of steps. Robert went up them."|FALSE
836|"Suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of Jane, and"|FALSE
836|"everybody screamed, 'Oh! what is it?'"|FALSE
836|"'I've only bashed my head in,' said Robert, when he had groaned for some"|FALSE
836|"time; 'that's all. Don't mention it; I like it. The stairs just go right"|FALSE
836|"slap into the ceiling, and it's a stone ceiling. You can't do good and"|FALSE
836|"kind actions underneath a paving-stone.'"|FALSE
836|"'Stairs aren't made to lead just to paving-stones as a general rule,'"|FALSE
836|"said the Phoenix. 'Put your shoulder to the wheel.'"|FALSE
836|"'There isn't any wheel,' said the injured Robert, still rubbing his"|FALSE
836|"head."|FALSE
836|"But Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair, and was already shoving"|FALSE
836|"his hardest against the stone above. Of course, it did not give in the"|FALSE
836|"least."|FALSE
836|"'If it's a trap-door--' said Cyril. And he stopped shoving and began to"|FALSE
836|"feel about with his hands."|FALSE
836|"'Yes, there is a bolt. I can't move it.'"|FALSE
836|"By a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oil-can of his father's"|FALSE
836|"bicycle; he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs, and he lay"|FALSE
836|"on his back, with his head on the top step and his feet straggling down"|FALSE
836|"among his young relations, and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rust"|FALSE
836|"and oil fell down on his face. One even went into his mouth--open, as he"|FALSE
836|"panted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position. Then"|FALSE
836|"he tried again, but still the bolt would not move. So now he tied his"|FALSE
836|"handkerchief--the one with the bacon-fat and marmalade on it--to the"|FALSE
836|"bolt, and Robert's handkerchief to that, in a reef knot, which cannot"|FALSE
836|"come undone however much you pull, and, indeed, gets tighter and tighter"|FALSE
836|"the more you pull it. This must not be confused with a granny knot,"|FALSE
836|"which comes undone if you look at it. And then he and Robert pulled,"|FALSE
836|"and the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too, and"|FALSE
836|"suddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch, and they all rolled"|FALSE
836|"together to the bottom of the stairs--all but the Phoenix, which had"|FALSE
836|"taken to its wings when the pulling began."|FALSE
836|"Nobody was hurt much, because the rolled-up carpet broke their fall; and"|FALSE
836|"now, indeed, the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose, for"|FALSE
836|"the stone allowed them to heave it up. They felt it give; dust fell"|FALSE
836|"freely on them."|FALSE
836|"'Now, then,' cried Robert, forgetting his head and his temper, 'push all"|FALSE
836|"together. One, two, three!'"|FALSE
836|"The stone was heaved up. It swung up on a creaking, unwilling hinge, and"|FALSE
836|"showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight; and it fell back with a"|FALSE
836|"bang against something that kept it upright. Every one climbed out,"|FALSE
836|"but there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in the"|FALSE
836|"little paved house where they found themselves, so when the Phoenix had"|FALSE
836|"fluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down, and it closed"|FALSE
836|"like a trap-door, as indeed it was."|FALSE
836|"You can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were. Fortunately"|FALSE
836|"there was no one to see them but each other. The place they were in"|FALSE
836|"was a little shrine, built on the side of a road that went winding up"|FALSE
836|"through yellow-green fields to the topless tower. Below them were fields"|FALSE
836|"and orchards, all bare boughs and brown furrows, and little houses and"|FALSE
836|"gardens. The shrine was a kind of tiny chapel with no front wall--just a"|FALSE
836|"place for people to stop and rest in and wish to be good. So the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"told them. There was an image that had once been brightly coloured, but"|FALSE
836|"the rain and snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine,"|FALSE
836|"and the poor image was dull and weather-stained. Under it was written:"|FALSE
836|"'St Jean de Luz. Priez pour nous.' It was a sad little place, very"|FALSE
836|"neglected and lonely, and yet it was nice, Anthea thought, that poor"|FALSE
836|"travellers should come to this little rest-house in the hurry and worry"|FALSE
836|"of their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes, and think about"|FALSE
836|"being good. The thought of St Jean de Luz--who had, no doubt, in his"|FALSE
836|"time, been very good and kind--made Anthea want more than ever to do"|FALSE
836|"something kind and good."|FALSE
836|"'Tell us,' she said to the Phoenix, 'what is the good and kind action"|FALSE
836|"the carpet brought us here to do?'"|FALSE
836|"'I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tell"|FALSE
836|"them about it,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'And give it them ALL?' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Yes. But whose is it?'"|FALSE
836|"'I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of the"|FALSE
836|"castle,' said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a good one."|FALSE
836|"They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road. A"|FALSE
836|"little way on they found a tiny spring, bubbling out of the hillside and"|FALSE
836|"falling into a rough stone basin surrounded by draggled hart's-tongue"|FALSE
836|"ferns, now hardly green at all. Here the children washed their hands"|FALSE
836|"and faces and dried them on their pocket-handkerchiefs, which always,"|FALSE
836|"on these occasions, seem unnaturally small. Cyril's and Robert's"|FALSE
836|"handkerchiefs, indeed, rather undid the effects of the wash. But in"|FALSE
836|"spite of this the party certainly looked cleaner than before."|FALSE
836|"The first house they came to was a little white house with green"|FALSE
836|"shutters and a slate roof. It stood in a prim little garden, and down"|FALSE
836|"each side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers to grow"|FALSE
836|"in; but all the flowers were dead now."|FALSE
836|"Along one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda, built of poles"|FALSE
836|"and trellis-work, and a vine crawled all over it. It was wider than our"|FALSE
836|"English verandas, and Anthea thought it must look lovely when the"|FALSE
836|"green leaves and the grapes were there; but now there were only dry,"|FALSE
836|"reddish-brown stalks and stems, with a few withered leaves caught in"|FALSE
836|"them."|FALSE
836|"The children walked up to the front door. It was green and narrow. A"|FALSE
836|"chain with a handle hung beside it, and joined itself quite openly to a"|FALSE
836|"rusty bell that hung under the porch. Cyril had pulled the bell and"|FALSE
836|"its noisy clang was dying away before the terrible thought came to all."|FALSE
836|"Cyril spoke it."|FALSE
836|"'My hat!' he breathed. 'We don't know any French!'"|FALSE
836|"At this moment the door opened. A very tall, lean lady, with pale"|FALSE
836|"ringlets like whitey-brown paper or oak shavings, stood before them. She"|FALSE
836|"had an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron. Her eyes were small"|FALSE
836|"and grey and not pretty, and the rims were red, as though she had been"|FALSE
836|"crying."|FALSE
836|"She addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreign"|FALSE
836|"language, and ended with something which they were sure was a question."|FALSE
836|"Of course, no one could answer it."|FALSE
836|"'What does she say?' Robert asked, looking down into the hollow of his"|FALSE
836|"jacket, where the Phoenix was nestling. But before the Phoenix could"|FALSE
836|"answer, the whitey-brown lady's face was lighted up by a most charming"|FALSE
836|"smile."|FALSE
836|"'You--you ar-r-re fr-r-rom the England!' she cried. 'I love so much"|FALSE
836|"the England. Mais entrez--entrez donc tous! Enter, then--enter all. One"|FALSE
836|"essuyes his feet on the carpet.' She pointed to the mat."|FALSE
836|"'We only wanted to ask--'"|FALSE
836|"'I shall say you all that what you wish,' said the lady. 'Enter only!'"|FALSE
836|"So they all went in, wiping their feet on a very clean mat, and putting"|FALSE
836|"the carpet in a safe corner of the veranda."|FALSE
836|"'The most beautiful days of my life,' said the lady, as she shut the"|FALSE
836|"door, 'did pass themselves in England. And since long time I have not"|FALSE
836|"heard an English voice to repeal me the past.'"|FALSE
836|"This warm welcome embarrassed every one, but most the boys, for the"|FALSE
836|"floor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles, and"|FALSE
836|"the floor of the sitting-room so very shiny--like a black"|FALSE
836|"looking-glass--that each felt as though he had on far more boots than"|FALSE
836|"usual, and far noisier."|FALSE
836|"There was a wood fire, very small and very bright, on the hearth--neat"|FALSE
836|"little logs laid on brass fire-dogs. Some portraits of powdered ladies"|FALSE
836|"and gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale walls. There were silver"|FALSE
836|"candlesticks on the mantelpiece, and there were chairs and a table, very"|FALSE
836|"slim and polite, with slender legs. The room was extremely bare, but"|FALSE
836|"with a bright foreign bareness that was very cheerful, in an odd way of"|FALSE
836|"its own. At the end of the polished table a very un-English little boy"|FALSE
836|"sat on a footstool in a high-backed, uncomfortable-looking chair. He"|FALSE
836|"wore black velvet, and the kind of collar--all frills and lacey--that"|FALSE
836|"Robert would rather have died than wear; but then the little French boy"|FALSE
836|"was much younger than Robert."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, how pretty!' said every one. But no one meant the little French"|FALSE
836|"boy, with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety short hair."|FALSE
836|"What every one admired was a little, little Christmas-tree, very green,"|FALSE
836|"and standing in a very red little flower-pot, and hung round with very"|FALSE
836|"bright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper. There were tiny"|FALSE
836|"candles on the tree, but they were not lighted yet."|FALSE
836|"'But yes--is it not that it is genteel?' said the lady. 'Sit down you"|FALSE
836|"then, and let us see.'"|FALSE
836|"The children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the wall, and"|FALSE
836|"the lady lighted a long, slim red taper at the wood flame, and then she"|FALSE
836|"drew the curtains and lit the little candles, and when they were all"|FALSE
836|"lighted the little French boy suddenly shouted, 'Bravo, ma tante! Oh,"|FALSE
836|"que c'est gentil,' and the English children shouted 'Hooray!'"|FALSE
836|"Then there was a struggle in the breast of Robert, and out fluttered the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix--spread his gold wings, flew to the top of the Christmas-tree,"|FALSE
836|"and perched there."|FALSE
836|"'Ah! catch it, then,' cried the lady; 'it will itself burn--your genteel"|FALSE
836|"parrakeet!'"|FALSE
836|"'It won't,' said Robert, 'thank you.'"|FALSE
836|"And the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands; but the lady"|FALSE
836|"was so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up and down on"|FALSE
836|"the shiny walnut-wood table."|FALSE
836|"'Is it that it talks?' asked the lady."|FALSE
836|"And the Phoenix replied in excellent French. It said, 'Parfaitement,"|FALSE
836|"madame!'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, the pretty parrakeet,' said the lady. 'Can it say still of other"|FALSE
836|"things?'"|FALSE
836|"And the Phoenix replied, this time in English, 'Why are you sad so near"|FALSE
836|"Christmas-time?'"|FALSE
836|"The children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise, for"|FALSE
836|"the youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice that"|FALSE
836|"strangers have been crying, and much worse to ask them the reason of"|FALSE
836|"their tears. And, of course, the lady began to cry again, very much"|FALSE
836|"indeed, after calling the Phoenix a bird without a heart; and she could"|FALSE
836|"not find her handkerchief, so Anthea offered hers, which was still very"|FALSE
836|"damp and no use at all. She also hugged the lady, and this seemed to be"|FALSE
836|"of more use than the handkerchief, so that presently the lady stopped"|FALSE
836|"crying, and found her own handkerchief and dried her eyes, and called"|FALSE
836|"Anthea a cherished angel."|FALSE
836|"'I am sorry we came just when you were so sad,' said Anthea, 'but we"|FALSE
836|"really only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, my little angel,' said the poor lady, sniffing, 'to-day and for"|FALSE
836|"hundreds of years the castle is to us, to our family. To-morrow it must"|FALSE
836|"that I sell it to some strangers--and my little Henri, who ignores"|FALSE
836|"all, he will not have never the lands paternal. But what will you? His"|FALSE
836|"father, my brother--Mr the Marquis--has spent much of money, and it the"|FALSE
836|"must, despite the sentiments of familial respect, that I admit that my"|FALSE
836|"sainted father he also--'"|FALSE
836|"'How would you feel if you found a lot of money--hundreds and thousands"|FALSE
836|"of gold pieces?' asked Cyril."|FALSE
836|"The lady smiled sadly."|FALSE
836|"'Ah! one has already recounted to you the legend?' she said. 'It is"|FALSE
836|"true that one says that it is long time; oh! but long time, one of our"|FALSE
836|"ancestors has hid a treasure--of gold, and of gold, and of gold--enough"|FALSE
836|"to enrich my little Henri for the life. But all that, my children, it is"|FALSE
836|"but the accounts of fays--'"|FALSE
836|"'She means fairy stories,' whispered the Phoenix to Robert. 'Tell her"|FALSE
836|"what you have found.'"|FALSE
836|"So Robert told, while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she"|FALSE
836|"should faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her with the"|FALSE
836|"earnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight."|FALSE
836|"'It's no use explaining how we got in,' said Robert, when he had told"|FALSE
836|"of the finding of the treasure, 'because you would find it a little"|FALSE
836|"difficult to understand, and much more difficult to believe. But we can"|FALSE
836|"show you where the gold is and help you to fetch it away.'"|FALSE
836|"The lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the hugs"|FALSE
836|"of the girls."|FALSE
836|"'No, he's not making it up,' said Anthea; 'it's true, TRUE, TRUE!--and"|FALSE
836|"we are so glad.'"|FALSE
836|"'You would not be capable to torment an old woman?' she said; 'and it is"|FALSE
836|"not possible that it be a dream.'"|FALSE
836|"'It really IS true,' said Cyril; 'and I congratulate you very much.'"|FALSE
836|"His tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the raptures"|FALSE
836|"of the others."|FALSE
836|"'If I do not dream,' she said, 'Henri come to Manon--and you--you shall"|FALSE
836|"come all with me to Mr the Curate. Is it not?'"|FALSE
836|"Manon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchief"|FALSE
836|"twisted round her head. She took Henri, who was already sleepy with the"|FALSE
836|"excitement of his Christmas-tree and his visitors, and when the lady had"|FALSE
836|"put on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black silk bonnet and a pair"|FALSE
836|"of black wooden clogs over her black cashmere house-boots, the whole"|FALSE
836|"party went down the road to a little white house--very like the one they"|FALSE
836|"had left--where an old priest, with a good face, welcomed them with a"|FALSE
836|"politeness so great that it hid his astonishment."|FALSE
836|"The lady, with her French waving hands and her shrugging French"|FALSE
836|"shoulders and her trembling French speech, told the story. And now the"|FALSE
836|"priest, who knew no English, shrugged HIS shoulders and waved HIS hands"|FALSE
836|"and spoke also in French."|FALSE
836|"'He thinks,' whispered the Phoenix, 'that her troubles have turned her"|FALSE
836|"brain. What a pity you know no French!'"|FALSE
836|"'I do know a lot of French,' whispered Robert, indignantly; 'but it's"|FALSE
836|"all about the pencil of the gardener's son and the penknife of the"|FALSE
836|"baker's niece--nothing that anyone ever wants to say.'"|FALSE
836|"'If _I_ speak,' the bird whispered, 'he'll think HE'S mad, too.'"|FALSE
836|"'Tell me what to say.'"|FALSE
836|"'Say \"C'est vrai, monsieur. Venez donc voir,\"' said the Phoenix; and"|FALSE
836|"then Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly saying,"|FALSE
836|"very loudly and distinctly--"|FALSE
836|"'Say vray, mossoo; venny dong vwaw.'"|FALSE
836|"The priest was disappointed when he found that Robert's French began and"|FALSE
836|"ended with these useful words; but, at any rate, he saw that if the lady"|FALSE
836|"was mad she was not the only one, and he put on a big beavery hat, and"|FALSE
836|"got a candle and matches and a spade, and they all went up the hill to"|FALSE
836|"the wayside shrine of St John of Luz."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' said Robert, 'I will go first and show you where it is.'"|FALSE
836|"So they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade, and Robert did"|FALSE
836|"go first, and they all followed and found the golden treasure exactly as"|FALSE
836|"they had left it. And every one was flushed with the joy of performing"|FALSE
836|"such a wonderfully kind action."|FALSE
836|"Then the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy, as French"|FALSE
836|"people do, and knelt down and touched the money, and talked very fast"|FALSE
836|"and both together, and the lady embraced all the children three times"|FALSE
836|"each, and called them 'little garden angels,' and then she and the"|FALSE
836|"priest shook each other by both hands again, and talked, and talked, and"|FALSE
836|"talked, faster and more Frenchy than you would have believed possible."|FALSE
836|"And the children were struck dumb with joy and pleasure."|FALSE
836|"'Get away NOW,' said the Phoenix softly, breaking in on the radiant"|FALSE
836|"dream."|FALSE
836|"So the children crept away, and out through the little shrine, and the"|FALSE
836|"lady and the priest were so tearfully, talkatively happy that they never"|FALSE
836|"noticed that the guardian angels had gone."|FALSE
836|"The 'garden angels' ran down the hill to the lady's little house, where"|FALSE
836|"they had left the carpet on the veranda, and they spread it out and"|FALSE
836|"said 'Home,' and no one saw them disappear, except little Henri, who"|FALSE
836|"had flattened his nose into a white button against the window-glass, and"|FALSE
836|"when he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had been dreaming. So that"|FALSE
836|"was all right."|FALSE
836|"'It is much the best thing we've done,' said Anthea, when they talked"|FALSE
836|"it over at tea-time. 'In the future we'll only do kind actions with the"|FALSE
836|"carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'Ahem!' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'I beg your pardon?' said Anthea."|FALSE

836|"CHAPTER 7. MEWS FROM PERSIA"|FALSE
836|"When you hear that the four children found themselves at Waterloo"|FALSE
836|"Station quite un-taken-care-of, and with no one to meet them, it may"|FALSE
836|"make you think that their parents were neither kind nor careful. But if"|FALSE
836|"you think this you will be wrong. The fact is, mother arranged with Aunt"|FALSE
836|"Emma that she was to meet the children at Waterloo, when they went back"|FALSE
836|"from their Christmas holiday at Lyndhurst. The train was fixed, but not"|FALSE

836|"the others had wandered three times up and down the platform at"|FALSE
836|"Waterloo--which makes six in all--and had bumped against old gentlemen,"|FALSE
836|"and stared in the faces of ladies, and been shoved by people in a hurry,"|FALSE
836|"and 'by-your-leaved' by porters with trucks, and were quite, quite sure"|FALSE
836|"that Aunt Emma was not there. Then suddenly the true truth of what he"|FALSE
836|"had forgotten to do came home to Robert, and he said, 'Oh, crikey!' and"|FALSE
836|"stood still with his mouth open, and let a porter with a Gladstone bag"|FALSE
836|"in each hand and a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavily"|FALSE
836|"into him, and never so much as said, 'Where are you shoving to now?' or,"|FALSE
836|"'Look out where you're going, can't you?' The heavier bag smote him at"|FALSE
836|"the knee, and he staggered, but he said nothing."|FALSE
836|"When the others understood what was the matter I think they told Robert"|FALSE
836|"what they thought of him."|FALSE
836|"'We must take the train to Croydon,' said Anthea, 'and find Aunt Emma.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Cyril, 'and precious pleased those Jevonses would be to see"|FALSE
836|"us and our traps.'"|FALSE
836|"Aunt Emma, indeed, was staying with some Jevonses--very prim people."|FALSE
836|"They were middle-aged and wore very smart blouses, and they were fond of"|FALSE
836|"matinees and shopping, and they did not care about children."|FALSE
836|"'I know MOTHER would be pleased to see us if we went back,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Yes, she would, but she'd think it was not right to show she was"|FALSE
836|"pleased, because it's Bob's fault we're not met. Don't I know the sort"|FALSE
836|"of thing?' said Cyril. 'Besides, we've no tin. No; we've got enough for"|FALSE
836|"a growler among us, but not enough for tickets to the New Forest. We"|FALSE
836|"must just go home. They won't be so savage when they find we've really"|FALSE
836|"got home all right. You know auntie was only going to take us home in a"|FALSE
836|"cab.'"|FALSE
836|"'I believe we ought to go to Croydon,' Anthea insisted."|FALSE
836|"'Aunt Emma would be out to a dead cert,' said Robert. 'Those Jevonses go"|FALSE
836|"to the theatre every afternoon, I believe. Besides, there's the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"at home, AND the carpet. I votes we call a four-wheeled cabman.'"|FALSE
836|"A four-wheeled cabman was called--his cab was one of the old-fashioned"|FALSE
836|"kind with straw in the bottom--and he was asked by Anthea to drive them"|FALSE
836|"very carefully to their address. This he did, and the price he asked"|FALSE
836|"for doing so was exactly the value of the gold coin grandpapa had given"|FALSE
836|"Cyril for Christmas. This cast a gloom; but Cyril would never have"|FALSE
836|"stooped to argue about a cab-fare, for fear the cabman should think he"|FALSE
836|"was not accustomed to take cabs whenever he wanted them. For a reason"|FALSE
836|"that was something like this he told the cabman to put the luggage"|FALSE
836|"on the steps, and waited till the wheels of the growler had grittily"|FALSE
836|"retired before he rang the bell."|FALSE
836|"'You see,' he said, with his hand on the handle, 'we don't want cook"|FALSE
836|"and Eliza asking us before HIM how it is we've come home alone, as if we"|FALSE
836|"were babies.'"|FALSE
836|"Here he rang the bell; and the moment its answering clang was heard,"|FALSE
836|"every one felt that it would be some time before that bell was answered."|FALSE
836|"The sound of a bell is quite different, somehow, when there is anyone"|FALSE
836|"inside the house who hears it. I can't tell you why that is--but so it"|FALSE
836|"is."|FALSE
836|"'I expect they're changing their dresses,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Too late,' said Anthea, 'it must be past five. I expect Eliza's gone to"|FALSE
836|"post a letter, and cook's gone to see the time.'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril rang again. And the bell did its best to inform the listening"|FALSE
836|"children that there was really no one human in the house. They rang"|FALSE
836|"again and listened intently. The hearts of all sank low. It is a"|FALSE
836|"terrible thing to be locked out of your own house, on a dark, muggy"|FALSE
836|"January evening."|FALSE
836|"'There is no gas on anywhere,' said Jane, in a broken voice."|FALSE
836|"'I expect they've left the gas on once too often, and the draught blew"|FALSE
836|"it out, and they're suffocated in their beds. Father always said they"|FALSE
836|"would some day,' said Robert cheerfully."|FALSE
836|"'Let's go and fetch a policeman,' said Anthea, trembling."|FALSE
836|"'And be taken up for trying to be burglars--no, thank you,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'I heard father read out of the paper about a young man who got into his"|FALSE
836|"own mother's house, and they got him made a burglar only the other day.'"|FALSE
836|"'I only hope the gas hasn't hurt the Phoenix,' said Anthea. 'It said it"|FALSE
836|"wanted to stay in the bathroom cupboard, and I thought it would be all"|FALSE
836|"right, because the servants never clean that out. But if it's gone and"|FALSE
836|"got out and been choked by gas--And besides, directly we open the door"|FALSE
836|"we shall be choked, too. I KNEW we ought to have gone to Aunt Emma, at"|FALSE
836|"Croydon. Oh, Squirrel, I wish we had. Let's go NOW.'"|FALSE
836|"'Shut up,' said her brother, briefly. 'There's some one rattling the"|FALSE
836|"latch inside.' Every one listened with all its ears, and every one stood"|FALSE
836|"back as far from the door as the steps would allow."|FALSE
836|"The latch rattled, and clicked. Then the flap of the letter-box lifted"|FALSE
836|"itself--every one saw it by the flickering light of the gas-lamp that"|FALSE
836|"shone through the leafless lime-tree by the gate--a golden eye seemed to"|FALSE
836|"wink at them through the letter-slit, and a cautious beak whispered--"|FALSE
836|"'Are you alone?'"|FALSE
836|"'It's the Phoenix,' said every one, in a voice so joyous, and so full of"|FALSE
836|"relief, as to be a sort of whispered shout."|FALSE
836|"'Hush!' said the voice from the letter-box slit. 'Your slaves have gone"|FALSE
836|"a-merry-making. The latch of this portal is too stiff for my beak."|FALSE
836|"But at the side--the little window above the shelf whereon your bread"|FALSE
836|"lies--it is not fastened.'"|FALSE
836|"'Righto!' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"And Anthea added, 'I wish you'd meet us there, dear Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"The children crept round to the pantry window. It is at the side of the"|FALSE
836|"house, and there is a green gate labelled 'Tradesmen's Entrance', which"|FALSE
836|"is always kept bolted. But if you get one foot on the fence between you"|FALSE
836|"and next door, and one on the handle of the gate, you are over before"|FALSE
836|"you know where you are. This, at least, was the experience of Cyril and"|FALSE
836|"Robert, and even, if the truth must be told, of Anthea and Jane. So in"|FALSE
836|"almost no time all four were in the narrow gravelled passage that runs"|FALSE
836|"between that house and the next."|FALSE
836|"Then Robert made a back, and Cyril hoisted himself up and got his"|FALSE
836|"knicker-bockered knee on the concrete window-sill. He dived into the"|FALSE
836|"pantry head first, as one dives into water, and his legs waved in the"|FALSE
836|"air as he went, just as your legs do when you are first beginning"|FALSE
836|"to learn to dive. The soles of his boots--squarish muddy"|FALSE
836|"patches--disappeared."|FALSE
836|"'Give me a leg up,' said Robert to his sisters."|FALSE
836|"'No, you don't,' said Jane firmly. 'I'm not going to be left outside"|FALSE
836|"here with just Anthea, and have something creep up behind us out of the"|FALSE
836|"dark. Squirrel can go and open the back door.'"|FALSE
836|"A light had sprung awake in the pantry. Cyril always said the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"turned the gas on with its beak, and lighted it with a waft of its wing;"|FALSE
836|"but he was excited at the time, and perhaps he really did it himself"|FALSE
836|"with matches, and then forgot all about it. He let the others in by the"|FALSE
836|"back door. And when it had been bolted again the children went all over"|FALSE
836|"the house and lighted every single gas-jet they could find. For they"|FALSE
836|"couldn't help feeling that this was just the dark dreary winter's"|FALSE
836|"evening when an armed burglar might easily be expected to appear at any"|FALSE
836|"moment. There is nothing like light when you are afraid of burglars--or"|FALSE
836|"of anything else, for that matter."|FALSE
836|"And when all the gas-jets were lighted it was quite clear that the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix had made no mistake, and that Eliza and cook were really out,"|FALSE
836|"and that there was no one in the house except the four children, and the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix, and the carpet, and the blackbeetles who lived in the cupboards"|FALSE
836|"on each side of the nursery fire-place. These last were very pleased"|FALSE
836|"that the children had come home again, especially when Anthea had"|FALSE
836|"lighted the nursery fire. But, as usual, the children treated the loving"|FALSE
836|"little blackbeetles with coldness and disdain."|FALSE
836|"I wonder whether you know how to light a fire? I don't mean how to"|FALSE
836|"strike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a fire"|FALSE
836|"someone has laid ready, but how to lay and light a fire all by yourself."|FALSE
836|"I will tell you how Anthea did it, and if ever you have to light one"|FALSE
836|"yourself you may remember how it is done. First, she raked out the ashes"|FALSE
836|"of the fire that had burned there a week ago--for Eliza had actually"|FALSE
836|"never done this, though she had had plenty of time. In doing this Anthea"|FALSE
836|"knocked her knuckle and made it bleed. Then she laid the largest and"|FALSE
836|"handsomest cinders in the bottom of the grate. Then she took a sheet"|FALSE
836|"of old newspaper (you ought never to light a fire with to-day's"|FALSE
836|"newspaper--it will not burn well, and there are other reasons against"|FALSE
836|"it), and tore it into four quarters, and screwed each of these into a"|FALSE
836|"loose ball, and put them on the cinders; then she got a bundle of wood"|FALSE
836|"and broke the string, and stuck the sticks in so that their front ends"|FALSE
836|"rested on the bars, and the back ends on the back of the paper balls."|FALSE
836|"In doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string, and when she"|FALSE
836|"broke it, two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on the cheek. Then she"|FALSE
836|"put more cinders and some bits of coal--no dust. She put most of that"|FALSE
836|"on her hands, but there seemed to be enough left for her face. Then"|FALSE
836|"she lighted the edges of the paper balls, and waited till she heard the"|FALSE
836|"fizz-crack-crack-fizz of the wood as it began to burn. Then she went and"|FALSE
836|"washed her hands and face under the tap in the back kitchen."|FALSE
836|"Of course, you need not bark your knuckles, or cut your finger, or"|FALSE
836|"bruise your cheek with wood, or black yourself all over; but otherwise,"|FALSE
836|"this is a very good way to light a fire in London. In the real country"|FALSE
836|"fires are lighted in a different and prettier way."|FALSE
836|"But it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards, wherever"|FALSE
836|"you are."|FALSE
836|"While Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with the"|FALSE
836|"cheerful blaze, Jane had set the table for--I was going to say tea, but"|FALSE
836|"the meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea. Let us call it a"|FALSE
836|"tea-ish meal. There was tea, certainly, for Anthea's fire blazed and"|FALSE
836|"crackled so kindly that it really seemed to be affectionately inviting"|FALSE
836|"the kettle to come and sit upon its lap. So the kettle was brought and"|FALSE
836|"tea made. But no milk could be found--so every one had six lumps of"|FALSE
836|"sugar to each cup instead. The things to eat, on the other hand, were"|FALSE
836|"nicer than usual. The boys looked about very carefully, and found in"|FALSE
836|"the pantry some cold tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and part of a cold"|FALSE
836|"pudding--very much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home. And"|FALSE
836|"in the kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake, a pot of strawberry"|FALSE
836|"jam, and about a pound of mixed candied fruit, with soft crumbly slabs"|FALSE
836|"of delicious sugar in each cup of lemon, orange, or citron."|FALSE
836|"It was indeed, as Jane said, 'a banquet fit for an Arabian Knight.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix perched on Robert's chair, and listened kindly and"|FALSE
836|"politely to all they had to tell it about their visit to Lyndhurst,"|FALSE
836|"and underneath the table, by just stretching a toe down rather far, the"|FALSE
836|"faithful carpet could be felt by all--even by Jane, whose legs were very"|FALSE
836|"short."|FALSE
836|"'Your slaves will not return to-night,' said the Phoenix. 'They sleep"|FALSE
836|"under the roof of the cook's stepmother's aunt, who is, I gather,"|FALSE
836|"hostess to a large party to-night in honour of her husband's cousin's"|FALSE
836|"sister-in-law's mother's ninetieth birthday.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't think they ought to have gone without leave,' said Anthea,"|FALSE
836|"'however many relations they have, or however old they are; but I"|FALSE
836|"suppose we ought to wash up.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not our business about the leave,' said Cyril, firmly, 'but I"|FALSE
836|"simply won't wash up for them. We got it, and we'll clear it away; and"|FALSE
836|"then we'll go somewhere on the carpet. It's not often we get a chance"|FALSE
836|"of being out all night. We can go right away to the other side of the"|FALSE
836|"equator, to the tropical climes, and see the sun rise over the great"|FALSE
836|"Pacific Ocean.'"|FALSE
836|"'Right you are,' said Robert. 'I always did want to see the Southern"|FALSE
836|"Cross and the stars as big as gas-lamps.'"|FALSE
836|"'DON'T go,' said Anthea, very earnestly, 'because I COULDN'T. I'm SURE"|FALSE
836|"mother wouldn't like us to leave the house and I should hate to be left"|FALSE
836|"here alone.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'd stay with you,' said Jane loyally."|FALSE
836|"'I know you would,' said Anthea gratefully, 'but even with you I'd much"|FALSE
836|"rather not.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said Cyril, trying to be kind and amiable, 'I don't want you to"|FALSE
836|"do anything you think's wrong, BUT--'"|FALSE
836|"He was silent; this silence said many things."|FALSE
836|"'I don't see,' Robert was beginning, when Anthea interrupted--"|FALSE
836|"'I'm quite sure. Sometimes you just think a thing's wrong, and sometimes"|FALSE
836|"you KNOW. And this is a KNOW time.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix turned kind golden eyes on her and opened a friendly beak to"|FALSE
836|"say--"|FALSE
836|"'When it is, as you say, a \"know time\", there is no more to be said. And"|FALSE
836|"your noble brothers would never leave you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Of course not,' said Cyril rather quickly. And Robert said so too."|FALSE
836|"'I myself,' the Phoenix went on, 'am willing to help in any way"|FALSE
836|"possible. I will go personally--either by carpet or on the wing--and"|FALSE
836|"fetch you anything you can think of to amuse you during the evening. In"|FALSE
836|"order to waste no time I could go while you wash up.--Why,' it went on"|FALSE
836|"in a musing voice, 'does one wash up teacups and wash down the stairs?'"|FALSE
836|"'You couldn't wash stairs up, you know,' said Anthea, 'unless you began"|FALSE
836|"at the bottom and went up feet first as you washed. I wish cook would"|FALSE
836|"try that way for a change.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't,' said Cyril, briefly. 'I should hate the look of her"|FALSE
836|"elastic-side boots sticking up.'"|FALSE
836|"'This is mere trifling,' said the Phoenix. 'Come, decide what I shall"|FALSE
836|"fetch for you. I can get you anything you like.'"|FALSE
836|"But of course they couldn't decide. Many things were suggested--a"|FALSE
836|"rocking-horse, jewelled chessmen, an elephant, a bicycle, a motor-car,"|FALSE
836|"books with pictures, musical instruments, and many other things. But"|FALSE
836|"a musical instrument is agreeable only to the player, unless he has"|FALSE
836|"learned to play it really well; books are not sociable, bicycles cannot"|FALSE
836|"be ridden without going out of doors, and the same is true of motor-cars"|FALSE
836|"and elephants. Only two people can play chess at once with one set of"|FALSE
836|"chessmen (and anyway it's very much too much like lessons for a game),"|FALSE
836|"and only one can ride on a rocking-horse. Suddenly, in the midst of the"|FALSE
836|"discussion, the Phoenix spread its wings and fluttered to the floor, and"|FALSE
836|"from there it spoke."|FALSE
836|"'I gather,' it said, 'from the carpet, that it wants you to let it go"|FALSE
836|"to its old home, where it was born and brought up, and it will return"|FALSE
836|"within the hour laden with a number of the most beautiful and delightful"|FALSE
836|"products of its native land.'"|FALSE
836|"'What IS its native land?'"|FALSE
836|"'I didn't gather. But since you can't agree, and time is passing, and"|FALSE
836|"the tea-things are not washed down--I mean washed up--'"|FALSE
836|"'I votes we do,' said Robert. 'It'll stop all this jaw, anyway. And it's"|FALSE
836|"not bad to have surprises. Perhaps it's a Turkey carpet, and it might"|FALSE
836|"bring us Turkish delight.'"|FALSE
836|"'Or a Turkish patrol,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'Or a Turkish bath,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Or a Turkish towel,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Nonsense,' Robert urged, 'it said beautiful and delightful, and towels"|FALSE
836|"and baths aren't THAT, however good they may be for you. Let it go. I"|FALSE
836|"suppose it won't give us the slip,' he added, pushing back his chair and"|FALSE
836|"standing up."|FALSE
836|"'Hush!' said the Phoenix; 'how can you? Don't trample on its feelings"|FALSE
836|"just because it's only a carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'But how can it do it--unless one of us is on it to do the wishing?'"|FALSE
836|"asked Robert. He spoke with a rising hope that it MIGHT be necessary for"|FALSE
836|"one to go and why not Robert? But the Phoenix quickly threw cold water"|FALSE
836|"on his new-born dream."|FALSE
836|"'Why, you just write your wish on a paper, and pin it on the carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"So a leaf was torn from Anthea's arithmetic book, and on it Cyril wrote"|FALSE
836|"in large round-hand the following:"|FALSE
836|"We wish you to go to your dear native home, and bring back the most"|FALSE
836|"beautiful and delightful productions of it you can--and not to be gone"|FALSE
836|"long, please."|FALSE
836|"                    (Signed)  CYRIL."|FALSE
836|"                              ROBERT."|FALSE
836|"                              ANTHEA."|FALSE
836|"                              JANE."|FALSE
836|"Then the paper was laid on the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Writing down, please,' said the Phoenix; 'the carpet can't read a paper"|FALSE
836|"whose back is turned to it, any more than you can.'"|FALSE
836|"It was pinned fast, and the table and chairs having been moved, the"|FALSE
836|"carpet simply and suddenly vanished, rather like a patch of water on a"|FALSE
836|"hearth under a fierce fire. The edges got smaller and smaller, and then"|FALSE
836|"it disappeared from sight."|FALSE
836|"'It may take it some time to collect the beautiful and delightful"|FALSE
836|"things,' said the Phoenix. 'I should wash up--I mean wash down.'"|FALSE
836|"So they did. There was plenty of hot water left in the kettle, and every"|FALSE
836|"one helped--even the Phoenix, who took up cups by their handles with its"|FALSE
836|"clever claws and dipped them in the hot water, and then stood them on"|FALSE
836|"the table ready for Anthea to dry them. But the bird was rather slow,"|FALSE
836|"because, as it said, though it was not above any sort of honest work,"|FALSE
836|"messing about with dish-water was not exactly what it had been brought"|FALSE
836|"up to. Everything was nicely washed up, and dried, and put in its proper"|FALSE
836|"place, and the dish-cloth washed and hung on the edge of the copper"|FALSE
836|"to dry, and the tea-cloth was hung on the line that goes across the"|FALSE
836|"scullery. (If you are a duchess's child, or a king's, or a person of"|FALSE
836|"high social position's child, you will perhaps not know the difference"|FALSE
836|"between a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth; but in that case your nurse has"|FALSE
836|"been better instructed than you, and she will tell you all about it.)"|FALSE
836|"And just as eight hands and one pair of claws were being dried on the"|FALSE
836|"roller-towel behind the scullery door there came a strange sound from"|FALSE
836|"the other side of the kitchen wall--the side where the nursery was. It"|FALSE
836|"was a very strange sound, indeed--most odd, and unlike any other sounds"|FALSE
836|"the children had ever heard. At least, they had heard sounds as much"|FALSE
836|"like it as a toy engine's whistle is like a steam siren's."|FALSE
836|"'The carpet's come back,' said Robert; and the others felt that he was"|FALSE
836|"right."|FALSE
836|"'But what has it brought with it?' asked Jane. 'It sounds like"|FALSE
836|"Leviathan, that great beast.'"|FALSE
836|"'It couldn't have been made in India, and have brought elephants? Even"|FALSE
836|"baby ones would be rather awful in that room,' said Cyril. 'I vote we"|FALSE
836|"take it in turns to squint through the keyhole.'"|FALSE
836|"They did--in the order of their ages. The Phoenix, being the eldest by"|FALSE
836|"some thousands of years, was entitled to the first peep. But--"|FALSE
836|"'Excuse me,' it said, ruffling its golden feathers and sneezing softly;"|FALSE
836|"'looking through keyholes always gives me a cold in my golden eyes.'"|FALSE
836|"So Cyril looked."|FALSE
836|"'I see something grey moving,' said he."|FALSE
836|"'It's a zoological garden of some sort, I bet,' said Robert, when he had"|FALSE
836|"taken his turn. And the soft rustling, bustling, ruffling, scuffling,"|FALSE
836|"shuffling, fluffling noise went on inside."|FALSE
836|"'_I_ can't see anything,' said Anthea, 'my eye tickles so.'"|FALSE
836|"Then Jane's turn came, and she put her eye to the keyhole."|FALSE
836|"'It's a giant kitty-cat,' she said; 'and it's asleep all over the"|FALSE
836|"floor.'"|FALSE
836|"'Giant cats are tigers--father said so.'"|FALSE
836|"'No, he didn't. He said tigers were giant cats. It's not at all the same"|FALSE
836|"thing.'"|FALSE
836|"'It's no use sending the carpet to fetch precious things for you"|FALSE
836|"if you're afraid to look at them when they come,' said the Phoenix,"|FALSE
836|"sensibly. And Cyril, being the eldest, said--"|FALSE
836|"'Come on,' and turned the handle."|FALSE
836|"The gas had been left full on after tea, and everything in the room"|FALSE
836|"could be plainly seen by the ten eyes at the door. At least, not"|FALSE
836|"everything, for though the carpet was there it was invisible, because it"|FALSE
836|"was completely covered by the hundred and ninety-nine beautiful objects"|FALSE
836|"which it had brought from its birthplace."|FALSE
836|"'My hat!' Cyril remarked. 'I never thought about its being a PERSIAN"|FALSE
836|"carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"Yet it was now plain that it was so, for the beautiful objects which it"|FALSE
836|"had brought back were cats--Persian cats, grey Persian cats, and there"|FALSE
836|"were, as I have said, 199 of them, and they were sitting on the carpet"|FALSE
836|"as close as they could get to each other. But the moment the children"|FALSE
836|"entered the room the cats rose and stretched, and spread and overflowed"|FALSE
836|"from the carpet to the floor, and in an instant the floor was a sea of"|FALSE
836|"moving, mewing pussishness, and the children with one accord climbed to"|FALSE
836|"the table, and gathered up their legs, and the people next door knocked"|FALSE
836|"on the wall--and, indeed, no wonder, for the mews were Persian and"|FALSE
836|"piercing."|FALSE
836|"'This is pretty poor sport,' said Cyril. 'What's the matter with the"|FALSE
836|"bounders?'"|FALSE
836|"'I imagine that they are hungry,' said the Phoenix. 'If you were to feed"|FALSE
836|"them--'"|FALSE
836|"'We haven't anything to feed them with,' said Anthea in despair, and she"|FALSE
836|"stroked the nearest Persian back. 'Oh, pussies, do be quiet--we can't"|FALSE

836|"'Let's ask the carpet to take them away,' said Robert. But the girls"|FALSE
836|"said 'No.'"|FALSE
836|"'They are so soft and pussy,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"'And valuable,' said Anthea, hastily. 'We can sell them for lots and"|FALSE
836|"lots of money.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why not send the carpet to get food for them?' suggested the Phoenix,"|FALSE
836|"and its golden voice came harsh and cracked with the effort it had to be"|FALSE
836|"make to be heard above the increasing fierceness of the Persian mews."|FALSE
836|"So it was written that the carpet should bring food for 199 Persian"|FALSE
836|"cats, and the paper was pinned to the carpet as before."|FALSE
836|"The carpet seemed to gather itself together, and the cats dropped off"|FALSE
836|"it, as raindrops do from your mackintosh when you shake it. And the"|FALSE
836|"carpet disappeared."|FALSE
836|"Unless you have had one-hundred and ninety-nine well-grown Persian cats"|FALSE
836|"in one small room, all hungry, and all saying so in unmistakable mews,"|FALSE
836|"you can form but a poor idea of the noise that now deafened the children"|FALSE
836|"and the Phoenix. The cats did not seem to have been at all properly"|FALSE
836|"brought up. They seemed to have no idea of its being a mistake in"|FALSE
836|"manners to ask for meals in a strange house--let alone to howl for"|FALSE
836|"them--and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed,"|FALSE
836|"till the children poked their fingers into their ears and waited in"|FALSE
836|"silent agony, wondering why the whole of Camden Town did not come"|FALSE
836|"knocking at the door to ask what was the matter, and only hoping that"|FALSE
836|"the food for the cats would come before the neighbours did--and before"|FALSE
836|"all the secret of the carpet and the Phoenix had to be given away beyond"|FALSE
836|"recall to an indignant neighbourhood."|FALSE
836|"The cats mewed and mewed and twisted their Persian forms in and out and"|FALSE
836|"unfolded their Persian tails, and the children and the Phoenix huddled"|FALSE
836|"together on the table."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix, Robert noticed suddenly, was trembling."|FALSE
836|"'So many cats,' it said, 'and they might not know I was the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"These accidents happen so quickly. It quite un-mans me.'"|FALSE
836|"This was a danger of which the children had not thought."|FALSE
836|"'Creep in,' cried Robert, opening his jacket."|FALSE
836|"And the Phoenix crept in--only just in time, for green eyes had glared,"|FALSE
836|"pink noses had sniffed, white whiskers had twitched, and as Robert"|FALSE
836|"buttoned his coat he disappeared to the waist in a wave of eager grey"|FALSE
836|"Persian fur. And on the instant the good carpet slapped itself down on"|FALSE
836|"the floor. And it was covered with rats--three hundred and ninety-eight"|FALSE
836|"of them, I believe, two for each cat."|FALSE
836|"'How horrible!' cried Anthea. 'Oh, take them away!'"|FALSE
836|"'Take yourself away,' said the Phoenix, 'and me.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wish we'd never had a carpet,' said Anthea, in tears."|FALSE
836|"They hustled and crowded out of the door, and shut it, and locked it."|FALSE
836|"Cyril, with great presence of mind, lit a candle and turned off the gas"|FALSE
836|"at the main."|FALSE
836|"'The rats'll have a better chance in the dark,' he said."|FALSE
836|"The mewing had ceased. Every one listened in breathless silence. We all"|FALSE
836|"know that cats eat rats--it is one of the first things we read in our"|FALSE
836|"little brown reading books; but all those cats eating all those rats--it"|FALSE
836|"wouldn't bear thinking of."|FALSE
836|"Suddenly Robert sniffed, in the silence of the dark kitchen, where the"|FALSE
836|"only candle was burning all on one side, because of the draught."|FALSE
836|"'What a funny scent!' he said."|FALSE
836|"And as he spoke, a lantern flashed its light through the window of the"|FALSE
836|"kitchen, a face peered in, and a voice said--"|FALSE
836|"'What's all this row about? You let me in.'"|FALSE
836|"It was the voice of the police!"|FALSE
836|"Robert tip-toed to the window, and spoke through the pane that had"|FALSE
836|"been a little cracked since Cyril accidentally knocked it with a"|FALSE
836|"walking-stick when he was playing at balancing it on his nose. (It was"|FALSE
836|"after they had been to a circus.)"|FALSE
836|"'What do you mean?' he said. 'There's no row. You listen; everything's"|FALSE
836|"as quiet as quiet.' And indeed it was."|FALSE
836|"The strange sweet scent grew stronger, and the Phoenix put out its beak."|FALSE
836|"The policeman hesitated."|FALSE
836|"'They're MUSK-rats,' said the Phoenix. 'I suppose some cats eat"|FALSE
836|"them--but never Persian ones. What a mistake for a well-informed carpet"|FALSE
836|"to make! Oh, what a night we're having!'"|FALSE
836|"'Do go away,' said Robert, nervously. 'We're just going to bed--that's"|FALSE
836|"our bedroom candle; there isn't any row. Everything's as quiet as a"|FALSE
836|"mouse.'"|FALSE
836|"A wild chorus of mews drowned his words, and with the mews were mingled"|FALSE
836|"the shrieks of the musk-rats. What had happened? Had the cats tasted"|FALSE
836|"them before deciding that they disliked the flavour?"|FALSE
836|"'I'm a-coming in,' said the policeman. 'You've got a cat shut up there.'"|FALSE
836|"'A cat,' said Cyril. 'Oh, my only aunt! A cat!'"|FALSE
836|"'Come in, then,' said Robert. 'It's your own look out. I advise you not."|FALSE
836|"Wait a shake, and I'll undo the side gate.'"|FALSE
836|"He undid the side gate, and the policeman, very cautiously, came in. And"|FALSE
836|"there in the kitchen, by the light of one candle, with the mewing"|FALSE
836|"and the screaming going like a dozen steam sirens, twenty waiting on"|FALSE
836|"motor-cars, and half a hundred squeaking pumps, four agitated voices"|FALSE
836|"shouted to the policeman four mixed and wholly different explanations of"|FALSE
836|"the very mixed events of the evening."|FALSE
836|"Did you ever try to explain the simplest thing to a policeman?"|FALSE
836|"CHAPTER 8. THE CATS, THE COW, AND THE BURGLAR"|FALSE
836|"The nursery was full of Persian cats and musk-rats that had been brought"|FALSE
836|"there by the wishing carpet. The cats were mewing and the musk-rats were"|FALSE
836|"squeaking so that you could hardly hear yourself speak. In the kitchen"|FALSE
836|"were the four children, one candle, a concealed Phoenix, and a very"|FALSE
836|"visible policeman."|FALSE
836|"'Now then, look here,' said the Policeman, very loudly, and he pointed"|FALSE
836|"his lantern at each child in turn, 'what's the meaning of this here"|FALSE
836|"yelling and caterwauling. I tell you you've got a cat here, and some"|FALSE
836|"one's a ill-treating of it. What do you mean by it, eh?'"|FALSE
836|"It was five to one, counting the Phoenix; but the policeman, who was"|FALSE
836|"one, was of unusually fine size, and the five, including the Phoenix,"|FALSE
836|"were small. The mews and the squeaks grew softer, and in the comparative"|FALSE
836|"silence, Cyril said--"|FALSE
836|"'It's true. There are a few cats here. But we've not hurt them. It's"|FALSE
836|"quite the opposite. We've just fed them.'"|FALSE
836|"'It don't sound like it,' said the policeman grimly."|FALSE
836|"'I daresay they're not REAL cats,' said Jane madly, perhaps they're only"|FALSE
836|"dream-cats.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'll dream-cat you, my lady,' was the brief response of the force."|FALSE
836|"'If you understood anything except people who do murders and stealings"|FALSE
836|"and naughty things like that, I'd tell you all about it,' said Robert;"|FALSE
836|"'but I'm certain you don't. You're not meant to shove your oar into"|FALSE
836|"people's private cat-keepings. You're only supposed to interfere when"|FALSE
836|"people shout \"murder\" and \"stop thief\" in the street. So there!'"|FALSE
836|"The policeman assured them that he should see about that; and at this"|FALSE
836|"point the Phoenix, who had been making itself small on the pot-shelf"|FALSE
836|"under the dresser, among the saucepan lids and the fish-kettle, walked"|FALSE
836|"on tip-toed claws in a noiseless and modest manner, and left the room"|FALSE
836|"unnoticed by any one."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, don't be so horrid,' Anthea was saying, gently and earnestly. 'We"|FALSE
836|"LOVE cats--dear pussy-soft things. We wouldn't hurt them for worlds."|FALSE
836|"Would we, Pussy?'"|FALSE
836|"And Jane answered that of course they wouldn't. And still the policeman"|FALSE
836|"seemed unmoved by their eloquence."|FALSE
836|"'Now, look here,' he said, 'I'm a-going to see what's in that room"|FALSE
836|"beyond there, and--'"|FALSE
836|"His voice was drowned in a wild burst of mewing and squeaking. And as"|FALSE
836|"soon as it died down all four children began to explain at once; and"|FALSE
836|"though the squeaking and mewing were not at their very loudest, yet"|FALSE
836|"there was quite enough of both to make it very hard for the policeman"|FALSE
836|"to understand a single word of any of the four wholly different"|FALSE
836|"explanations now poured out to him."|FALSE
836|"'Stow it,' he said at last. 'I'm a-goin' into the next room in the"|FALSE
836|"execution of my duty. I'm a-goin' to use my eyes--my ears have gone off"|FALSE
836|"their chumps, what with you and them cats.'"|FALSE
836|"And he pushed Robert aside, and strode through the door."|FALSE
836|"'Don't say I didn't warn you,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'It's tigers REALLY,' said Jane. 'Father said so. I wouldn't go in, if I"|FALSE
836|"were you.'"|FALSE
836|"But the policeman was quite stony; nothing any one said seemed to make"|FALSE
836|"any difference to him. Some policemen are like this, I believe. He"|FALSE
836|"strode down the passage, and in another moment he would have been in the"|FALSE
836|"room with all the cats and all the rats (musk), but at that very instant"|FALSE
836|"a thin, sharp voice screamed from the street outside--"|FALSE
836|"'Murder--murder! Stop thief!'"|FALSE
836|"The policeman stopped, with one regulation boot heavily poised in the"|FALSE
836|"air."|FALSE
836|"'Eh?' he said."|FALSE
836|"And again the shrieks sounded shrilly and piercingly from the dark"|FALSE
836|"street outside."|FALSE
836|"'Come on,' said Robert. 'Come and look after cats while somebody's being"|FALSE
836|"killed outside.' For Robert had an inside feeling that told him quite"|FALSE
836|"plainly WHO it was that was screaming."|FALSE
836|"'You young rip,' said the policeman, 'I'll settle up with you bimeby.'"|FALSE
836|"And he rushed out, and the children heard his boots going weightily"|FALSE
836|"along the pavement, and the screams also going along, rather ahead of"|FALSE
836|"the policeman; and both the murder-screams and the policeman's boots"|FALSE
836|"faded away in the remote distance."|FALSE
836|"Then Robert smacked his knickerbocker loudly with his palm, and said--"|FALSE
836|"'Good old Phoenix! I should know its golden voice anywhere.'"|FALSE
836|"And then every one understood how cleverly the Phoenix had caught at"|FALSE
836|"what Robert had said about the real work of a policeman being to look"|FALSE
836|"after murderers and thieves, and not after cats, and all hearts were"|FALSE
836|"filled with admiring affection."|FALSE
836|"'But he'll come back,' said Anthea, mournfully, 'as soon as it finds the"|FALSE
836|"murderer is only a bright vision of a dream, and there isn't one at all"|FALSE
836|"really.'"|FALSE
836|"'No he won't,' said the soft voice of the clever Phoenix, as it flew"|FALSE
836|"in. 'HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS. I heard him own as much to a"|FALSE
836|"fellow mercenary. Oh! what a night we are having! Lock the door, and let"|FALSE
836|"us rid ourselves of this intolerable smell of the perfume peculiar"|FALSE
836|"to the musk-rat and to the house of the trimmers of beards. If you'll"|FALSE
836|"excuse me, I will go to bed. I am worn out.'"|FALSE
836|"It was Cyril who wrote the paper that told the carpet to take away the"|FALSE
836|"rats and bring milk, because there seemed to be no doubt in any breast"|FALSE
836|"that, however Persian cats may be, they must like milk."|FALSE
836|"'Let's hope it won't be musk-milk,' said Anthea, in gloom, as she pinned"|FALSE
836|"the paper face-downwards on the carpet. 'Is there such a thing as a"|FALSE
836|"musk-cow?' she added anxiously, as the carpet shrivelled and vanished."|FALSE
836|"'I do hope not. Perhaps really it WOULD have been wiser to let the"|FALSE
836|"carpet take the cats away. It's getting quite late, and we can't keep"|FALSE
836|"them all night.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, can't we?' was the bitter rejoinder of Robert, who had been"|FALSE
836|"fastening the side door. 'You might have consulted me,' he went on. 'I'm"|FALSE
836|"not such an idiot as some people.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why, whatever--'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't you see? We've jolly well GOT to keep the cats all night--oh, get"|FALSE
836|"down, you furry beasts!--because we've had three wishes out of the old"|FALSE
836|"carpet now, and we can't get any more till to-morrow.'"|FALSE
836|"The liveliness of Persian mews alone prevented the occurrence of a"|FALSE
836|"dismal silence."|FALSE
836|"Anthea spoke first."|FALSE
836|"'Never mind,' she said. 'Do you know, I really do think they're quieting"|FALSE
836|"down a bit. Perhaps they heard us say milk.'"|FALSE
836|"'They can't understand English,' said Jane. 'You forget they're Persian"|FALSE
836|"cats, Panther.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said Anthea, rather sharply, for she was tired and anxious, 'who"|FALSE
836|"told you \"milk\" wasn't Persian for milk. Lots of English words are"|FALSE
836|"just the same in French--at least I know \"miaw\" is, and \"croquet\", and"|FALSE
836|"\"fiance\". Oh, pussies, do be quiet! Let's stroke them as hard as we can"|FALSE
836|"with both hands, and perhaps they'll stop.'"|FALSE
836|"So every one stroked grey fur till their hands were tired, and as soon"|FALSE
836|"as a cat had been stroked enough to make it stop mewing it was pushed"|FALSE
836|"gently away, and another mewing mouser was approached by the hands of"|FALSE
836|"the strokers. And the noise was really more than half purr when the"|FALSE
836|"carpet suddenly appeared in its proper place, and on it, instead of rows"|FALSE
836|"of milk-cans, or even of milk-jugs, there was a COW. Not a Persian cow,"|FALSE
836|"either, nor, most fortunately, a musk-cow, if there is such a thing, but"|FALSE
836|"a smooth, sleek, dun-coloured Jersey cow, who blinked large soft eyes at"|FALSE
836|"the gas-light and mooed in an amiable if rather inquiring manner."|FALSE
836|"Anthea had always been afraid of cows; but now she tried to be brave."|FALSE
836|"'Anyway, it can't run after me,' she said to herself 'There isn't room"|FALSE
836|"for it even to begin to run.'"|FALSE
836|"The cow was perfectly placid. She behaved like a strayed duchess till"|FALSE
836|"some one brought a saucer for the milk, and some one else tried to milk"|FALSE
836|"the cow into it. Milking is very difficult. You may think it is easy,"|FALSE
836|"but it is not. All the children were by this time strung up to a pitch"|FALSE
836|"of heroism that would have been impossible to them in their ordinary"|FALSE
836|"condition. Robert and Cyril held the cow by the horns; and Jane, when"|FALSE
836|"she was quite sure that their end of the cow was quite secure, consented"|FALSE
836|"to stand by, ready to hold the cow by the tail should occasion arise."|FALSE
836|"Anthea, holding the saucer, now advanced towards the cow. She remembered"|FALSE
836|"to have heard that cows, when milked by strangers, are susceptible to"|FALSE
836|"the soothing influence of the human voice. So, clutching her saucer very"|FALSE
836|"tight, she sought for words to whose soothing influence the cow might be"|FALSE
836|"susceptible. And her memory, troubled by the events of the night, which"|FALSE
836|"seemed to go on and on for ever and ever, refused to help her with any"|FALSE
836|"form of words suitable to address a Jersey cow in."|FALSE
836|"'Poor pussy, then. Lie down, then, good dog, lie down!' was all that she"|FALSE
836|"could think of to say, and she said it."|FALSE
836|"And nobody laughed. The situation, full of grey mewing cats, was too"|FALSE
836|"serious for that. Then Anthea, with a beating heart, tried to milk the"|FALSE
836|"cow. Next moment the cow had knocked the saucer out of her hand and"|FALSE
836|"trampled on it with one foot, while with the other three she had walked"|FALSE
836|"on a foot each of Robert, Cyril, and Jane."|FALSE
836|"Jane burst into tears. 'Oh, how much too horrid everything is!' she"|FALSE
836|"cried. 'Come away. Let's go to bed and leave the horrid cats with the"|FALSE
836|"hateful cow. Perhaps somebody will eat somebody else. And serve them"|FALSE
836|"right.'"|FALSE
836|"They did not go to bed, but they had a shivering council in the"|FALSE
836|"drawing-room, which smelt of soot--and, indeed, a heap of this lay in"|FALSE
836|"the fender. There had been no fire in the room since mother went"|FALSE
836|"away, and all the chairs and tables were in the wrong places, and the"|FALSE
836|"chrysanthemums were dead, and the water in the pot nearly dried up."|FALSE
836|"Anthea wrapped the embroidered woolly sofa blanket round Jane and"|FALSE
836|"herself, while Robert and Cyril had a struggle, silent and brief, but"|FALSE
836|"fierce, for the larger share of the fur hearthrug."|FALSE
836|"'It is most truly awful,' said Anthea, 'and I am so tired. Let's let the"|FALSE
836|"cats loose.'"|FALSE
836|"'And the cow, perhaps?' said Cyril. 'The police would find us at once."|FALSE
836|"That cow would stand at the gate and mew--I mean moo--to come in. And so"|FALSE
836|"would the cats. No; I see quite well what we've got to do. We must"|FALSE
836|"put them in baskets and leave them on people's doorsteps, like orphan"|FALSE
836|"foundlings.'"|FALSE
836|"'We've got three baskets, counting mother's work one,' said Jane"|FALSE
836|"brightening."|FALSE
836|"'And there are nearly two hundred cats,' said Anthea, 'besides the"|FALSE
836|"cow--and it would have to be a different-sized basket for her; and then"|FALSE
836|"I don't know how you'd carry it, and you'd never find a doorstep big"|FALSE
836|"enough to put it on. Except the church one--and--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, well,' said Cyril, 'if you simply MAKE difficulties--'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm with you,' said Robert. 'Don't fuss about the cow, Panther. It's"|FALSE
836|"simply GOT to stay the night, and I'm sure I've read that the cow is a"|FALSE
836|"remunerating creature, and that means it will sit still and think"|FALSE
836|"for hours. The carpet can take it away in the morning. And as for the"|FALSE
836|"baskets, we'll do them up in dusters, or pillow-cases, or bath-towels."|FALSE
836|"Come on, Squirrel. You girls can be out of it if you like.'"|FALSE
836|"His tone was full of contempt, but Jane and Anthea were too tired and"|FALSE
836|"desperate to care; even being 'out of it', which at other times they"|FALSE
836|"could not have borne, now seemed quite a comfort. They snuggled down in"|FALSE
836|"the sofa blanket, and Cyril threw the fur hearthrug over them."|FALSE
836|"'Ah, he said, 'that's all women are fit for--to keep safe and warm,"|FALSE
836|"while the men do the work and run dangers and risks and things.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm not,' said Anthea, 'you know I'm not.' But Cyril was gone."|FALSE
836|"It was warm under the blanket and the hearthrug, and Jane snuggled up"|FALSE
836|"close to her sister; and Anthea cuddled Jane closely and kindly, and in"|FALSE
836|"a sort of dream they heard the rise of a wave of mewing as Robert opened"|FALSE
836|"the door of the nursery. They heard the booted search for baskets in"|FALSE
836|"the back kitchen. They heard the side door open and close, and they"|FALSE
836|"knew that each brother had gone out with at least one cat. Anthea's"|FALSE
836|"last thought was that it would take at least all night to get rid of"|FALSE
836|"one hundred and ninety-nine cats by twos. There would be ninety-nine"|FALSE
836|"journeys of two cats each, and one cat over."|FALSE
836|"'I almost think we might keep the one cat over,' said Anthea. 'I don't"|FALSE
836|"seem to care for cats just now, but I daresay I shall again some day.'"|FALSE
836|"And she fell asleep. Jane also was sleeping."|FALSE
836|"It was Jane who awoke with a start, to find Anthea still asleep. As, in"|FALSE
836|"the act of awakening, she kicked her sister, she wondered idly why"|FALSE
836|"they should have gone to bed in their boots; but the next moment she"|FALSE
836|"remembered where they were."|FALSE
836|"There was a sound of muffled, shuffled feet on the stairs. Like the"|FALSE
836|"heroine of the classic poem, Jane 'thought it was the boys', and as"|FALSE
836|"she felt quite wide awake, and not nearly so tired as before, she crept"|FALSE
836|"gently from Anthea's side and followed the footsteps. They went down"|FALSE
836|"into the basement; the cats, who seemed to have fallen into the sleep"|FALSE
836|"of exhaustion, awoke at the sound of the approaching footsteps and mewed"|FALSE
836|"piteously. Jane was at the foot of the stairs before she saw it was not"|FALSE
836|"her brothers whose coming had roused her and the cats, but a burglar."|FALSE
836|"She knew he was a burglar at once, because he wore a fur cap and a red"|FALSE
836|"and black charity-check comforter, and he had no business where he was."|FALSE
836|"If you had been stood in jane's shoes you would no doubt have run away"|FALSE
836|"in them, appealing to the police and neighbours with horrid screams. But"|FALSE
836|"Jane knew better. She had read a great many nice stories about burglars,"|FALSE
836|"as well as some affecting pieces of poetry, and she knew that no burglar"|FALSE
836|"will ever hurt a little girl if he meets her when burgling. Indeed, in"|FALSE
836|"all the cases Jane had read of, his burglarishness was almost at once"|FALSE
836|"forgotten in the interest he felt in the little girl's artless prattle."|FALSE
836|"So if Jane hesitated for a moment before addressing the burglar, it"|FALSE
836|"was only because she could not at once think of any remark sufficiently"|FALSE
836|"prattling and artless to make a beginning with. In the stories and the"|FALSE
836|"affecting poetry the child could never speak plainly, though it always"|FALSE
836|"looked old enough to in the pictures. And Jane could not make up her"|FALSE
836|"mind to lisp and 'talk baby', even to a burglar. And while she hesitated"|FALSE
836|"he softly opened the nursery door and went in."|FALSE
836|"Jane followed--just in time to see him sit down flat on the floor,"|FALSE
836|"scattering cats as a stone thrown into a pool splashes water."|FALSE
836|"She closed the door softly and stood there, still wondering whether she"|FALSE
836|"COULD bring herself to say, 'What's 'oo doing here, Mithter Wobber?' and"|FALSE
836|"whether any other kind of talk would do."|FALSE
836|"Then she heard the burglar draw a long breath, and he spoke."|FALSE
836|"'It's a judgement,' he said, 'so help me bob if it ain't. Oh, 'ere's a"|FALSE
836|"thing to 'appen to a chap! Makes it come 'ome to you, don't it neither?"|FALSE
836|"Cats an' cats an' cats. There couldn't be all them cats. Let alone the"|FALSE
836|"cow. If she ain't the moral of the old man's Daisy. She's a dream out of"|FALSE
836|"when I was a lad--I don't mind 'er so much. 'Ere, Daisy, Daisy?'"|FALSE
836|"The cow turned and looked at him."|FALSE
836|"'SHE'S all right,' he went on. 'Sort of company, too. Though them above"|FALSE
836|"knows how she got into this downstairs parlour. But them cats--oh, take"|FALSE
836|"'em away, take 'em away! I'll chuck the 'ole show--Oh, take 'em away.'"|FALSE
836|"'Burglar,' said Jane, close behind him, and he started convulsively,"|FALSE
836|"and turned on her a blank face, whose pale lips trembled. 'I can't take"|FALSE
836|"those cats away.'"|FALSE
836|"'Lor' lumme!' exclaimed the man; 'if 'ere ain't another on 'em. Are you"|FALSE
836|"real, miss, or something I'll wake up from presently?'"|FALSE
836|"'I am quite real,' said Jane, relieved to find that a lisp was not"|FALSE
836|"needed to make the burglar understand her. 'And so,' she added, 'are the"|FALSE
836|"cats.'"|FALSE
836|"'Then send for the police, send for the police, and I'll go quiet. If"|FALSE
836|"you ain't no realler than them cats, I'm done, spunchuck--out of time."|FALSE
836|"Send for the police. I'll go quiet. One thing, there'd not be room for"|FALSE

836|"'Burglar,' said Jane, kindly and softly, 'if you didn't like cats, what"|FALSE
836|"did you come here for?'"|FALSE
836|"'Send for the police,' was the unfortunate criminal's only reply. 'I'd"|FALSE
836|"rather you would--honest, I'd rather.'"|FALSE
836|"'I daren't,' said Jane, 'and besides, I've no one to send. I hate the"|FALSE
836|"police. I wish he'd never been born.'"|FALSE
836|"'You've a feeling 'art, miss,' said the burglar; 'but them cats is"|FALSE
836|"really a little bit too thick.'"|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Jane, 'I won't call the police. And I am quite a real"|FALSE
836|"little girl, though I talk older than the kind you've met before when"|FALSE
836|"you've been doing your burglings. And they are real cats--and they want"|FALSE
836|"real milk--and--Didn't you say the cow was like somebody's Daisy that"|FALSE
836|"you used to know?'"|FALSE
836|"'Wish I may die if she ain't the very spit of her,' replied the man."|FALSE
836|"'Well, then,' said Jane--and a thrill of joyful pride ran through"|FALSE
836|"her--'perhaps you know how to milk cows?'"|FALSE
836|"'Perhaps I does,' was the burglar's cautious rejoinder."|FALSE
836|"'Then,' said Jane, 'if you will ONLY milk ours--you don't know how we"|FALSE

836|"The burglar replied that loving was all very well."|FALSE
836|"'If those cats only had a good long, wet, thirsty drink of milk,' Jane"|FALSE

836|"you either.'"|FALSE
836|"This argument seemed to decide the criminal. Jane fetched the wash-bowl"|FALSE

836|"'It's all up,' said the man, desperately, 'this 'ere's a plant. 'ERE'S"|FALSE

836|"goodness it's only the boys!'"|FALSE
836|"It was; and their entrance had awakened Anthea, who, with her brothers,"|FALSE

836|"'This is a friend of mine,' said Jane; 'he's just called in, and he's"|FALSE
836|"going to milk the cow for us. ISN'T it good and kind of him?'"|FALSE
836|"She winked at the others, and though they did not understand they played"|FALSE

836|"milking.'"|FALSE
836|"'I shall 'ave a 'ead and a 'arf in the morning, and no bloomin' error,'"|FALSE
836|"remarked the burglar; but he began to milk the cow."|FALSE
836|"Robert was winked at to stay and see that he did not leave off milking"|FALSE
836|"or try to escape, and the others went to get things to put the milk in;"|FALSE
836|"for it was now spurting and foaming in the wash-bowl, and the cats had"|FALSE

836|"hope and anticipation on their whiskered faces."|FALSE
836|"'We can't get rid of any more cats,' said Cyril, as he and his sisters"|FALSE
836|"piled a tray high with saucers and soup-plates and platters and"|FALSE
836|"pie-dishes, 'the police nearly got us as it was. Not the same one--a"|FALSE
836|"much stronger sort. He thought it really was a foundling orphan we'd"|FALSE

836|"The gentle samishness of the milk swishing into the hand-bowl seemed"|FALSE

836|"into the pie-dishes and plates, and platters and saucers, and set them"|FALSE
836|"down to the music of Persian purrs and lappings."|FALSE
836|"'It makes me think of old times,' said the burglar, smearing his ragged"|FALSE

836|"pretty it was seeing the pigs killed.'"|FALSE
836|"Finding him in this softened mood, Jane said--"|FALSE

836|"that's the truth, young gents and ladies. And I don't know but what it"|FALSE

836|"own.'"|FALSE
836|"'I'm sure he would,' Jane agreed kindly; 'but what made you come here?'"|FALSE

836|"and trust to your noble 'earts. (You'd best bale out a bit, the pan's"|FALSE
836|"getting fullish.) I was a-selling oranges off of my barrow--for I ain't"|FALSE
836|"a burglar by trade, though you 'ave used the name so free--an' there was"|FALSE
836|"a lady bought three 'a'porth off me. An' while she was a-pickin' of them"|FALSE
836|"out--very careful indeed, and I'm always glad when them sort gets a few"|FALSE
836|"over-ripe ones--there was two other ladies talkin' over the fence. An'"|FALSE
836|"one on 'em said to the other on 'em just like this--"|FALSE
836|"\"'I've told both gells to come, and they can doss in with M'ria and"|FALSE
836|"Jane, 'cause their boss and his missis is miles away and the kids too."|FALSE
836|"So they can just lock up the 'ouse and leave the gas a-burning, so's"|FALSE
836|"no one won't know, and get back bright an' early by 'leven o'clock. And"|FALSE
836|"we'll make a night of it, Mrs Prosser, so we will. I'm just a-going"|FALSE
836|"to run out to pop the letter in the post.\" And then the lady what had"|FALSE
836|"chosen the three ha'porth so careful, she said: \"Lor, Mrs Wigson, I"|FALSE
836|"wonder at you, and your hands all over suds. This good gentleman'll slip"|FALSE
836|"it into the post for yer, I'll be bound, seeing I'm a customer of his.\""|FALSE
836|"So they give me the letter, and of course I read the direction what was"|FALSE
836|"written on it afore I shoved it into the post. And then when I'd sold"|FALSE
836|"my barrowful, I was a-goin' 'ome with the chink in my pocket, and I'm"|FALSE
836|"blowed if some bloomin' thievin' beggar didn't nick the lot whilst I was"|FALSE
836|"just a-wettin' of my whistle, for callin' of oranges is dry work. Nicked"|FALSE
836|"the bloomin' lot 'e did--and me with not a farden to take 'ome to my"|FALSE
836|"brother and his missus.'"|FALSE
836|"'How awful!' said Anthea, with much sympathy."|FALSE
836|"'Horful indeed, miss, I believe yer,' the burglar rejoined, with deep"|FALSE
836|"feeling. 'You don't know her temper when she's roused. An' I'm sure I"|FALSE
836|"'ope you never may, neither. And I'd 'ad all my oranges off of 'em."|FALSE
836|"So it came back to me what was wrote on the ongverlope, and I says to"|FALSE
836|"myself, \"Why not, seein' as I've been done myself, and if they keeps two"|FALSE
836|"slaveys there must be some pickings?\" An' so 'ere I am. But them cats,"|FALSE
836|"they've brought me back to the ways of honestness. Never no more.'"|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Cyril, 'these cats are very valuable--very indeed. And"|FALSE
836|"we will give them all to you, if only you will take them away.'"|FALSE
836|"'I see they're a breedy lot,' replied the burglar. 'But I don't want no"|FALSE
836|"bother with the coppers. Did you come by them honest now? Straight?'"|FALSE
836|"'They are all our very own,' said Anthea, 'we wanted them, but the"|FALSE
836|"confidement--'"|FALSE
836|"'Consignment,' whispered Cyril, 'was larger than we wanted, and they're"|FALSE
836|"an awful bother. If you got your barrow, and some sacks or baskets, your"|FALSE
836|"brother's missus would be awfully pleased. My father says Persian cats"|FALSE
836|"are worth pounds and pounds each.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said the burglar--and he was certainly moved by her remarks--'I"|FALSE
836|"see you're in a hole--and I don't mind lending a helping 'and. I don't"|FALSE
836|"ask 'ow you come by them. But I've got a pal--'e's a mark on cats. I'll"|FALSE

836|"'You won't go away and never come back,' said Jane, 'because I don't"|FALSE
836|"think I COULD bear that.'"|FALSE
836|"The burglar, quite touched by her emotion, swore sentimentally that,"|FALSE
836|"alive or dead, he would come back."|FALSE
836|"Then he went, and Cyril and Robert sent the girls to bed and sat up to"|FALSE
836|"wait for his return. It soon seemed absurd to await him in a state"|FALSE
836|"of wakefulness, but his stealthy tap on the window awoke them readily"|FALSE
836|"enough. For he did return, with the pal and the barrow and the sacks."|FALSE
836|"The pal approved of the cats, now dormant in Persian repletion, and"|FALSE
836|"they were bundled into the sacks, and taken away on the barrow--mewing,"|FALSE
836|"indeed, but with mews too sleepy to attract public attention."|FALSE
836|"'I'm a fence--that's what I am,' said the burglar gloomily. 'I never"|FALSE
836|"thought I'd come down to this, and all acause er my kind 'eart.'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril knew that a fence is a receiver of stolen goods, and he replied"|FALSE
836|"briskly--"|FALSE
836|"'I give you my sacred the cats aren't stolen. What do you make the"|FALSE
836|"time?'"|FALSE
836|"'I ain't got the time on me,' said the pal--'but it was just about"|FALSE
836|"chucking-out time as I come by the \"Bull and Gate\". I shouldn't wonder"|FALSE
836|"if it was nigh upon one now.'"|FALSE
836|"When the cats had been removed, and the boys and the burglar had parted"|FALSE
836|"with warm expressions of friendship, there remained only the cow."|FALSE
836|"'She must stay all night,' said Robert. 'Cook'll have a fit when she"|FALSE
836|"sees her.'"|FALSE
836|"'All night?' said Cyril. 'Why--it's tomorrow morning if it's one. We can"|FALSE
836|"have another wish!'"|FALSE
836|"So the carpet was urged, in a hastily written note, to remove the cow to"|FALSE
836|"wherever she belonged, and to return to its proper place on the nursery"|FALSE
836|"floor. But the cow could not be got to move on to the carpet. So Robert"|FALSE
836|"got the clothes line out of the back kitchen, and tied one end very"|FALSE
836|"firmly to the cow's horns, and the other end to a bunched-up corner of"|FALSE
836|"the carpet, and said 'Fire away.'"|FALSE
836|"And the carpet and cow vanished together, and the boys went to bed,"|FALSE
836|"tired out and only too thankful that the evening at last was over."|FALSE
836|"Next morning the carpet lay calmly in its place, but one corner was very"|FALSE
836|"badly torn. It was the corner that the cow had been tied on to."|FALSE
836|"CHAPTER 9. THE BURGLAR'S BRIDE"|FALSE
836|"The morning after the adventure of the Persian cats, the musk-rats, the"|FALSE
836|"common cow, and the uncommon burglar, all the children slept till it was"|FALSE
836|"ten o'clock; and then it was only Cyril who woke; but he attended to"|FALSE
836|"the others, so that by half past ten every one was ready to help to get"|FALSE
836|"breakfast. It was shivery cold, and there was but little in the house"|FALSE
836|"that was really worth eating."|FALSE
836|"Robert had arranged a thoughtful little surprise for the absent"|FALSE
836|"servants. He had made a neat and delightful booby trap over the kitchen"|FALSE
836|"door, and as soon as they heard the front door click open and knew the"|FALSE
836|"servants had come back, all four children hid in the cupboard under"|FALSE
836|"the stairs and listened with delight to the entrance--the tumble, the"|FALSE
836|"splash, the scuffle, and the remarks of the servants. They heard the"|FALSE
836|"cook say it was a judgement on them for leaving the place to itself;"|FALSE
836|"she seemed to think that a booby trap was a kind of plant that was quite"|FALSE
836|"likely to grow, all by itself, in a dwelling that was left shut up. But"|FALSE
836|"the housemaid, more acute, judged that someone must have been in the"|FALSE
836|"house--a view confirmed by the sight of the breakfast things on the"|FALSE
836|"nursery table."|FALSE
836|"The cupboard under the stairs was very tight and paraffiny, however, and"|FALSE
836|"a silent struggle for a place on top ended in the door bursting open"|FALSE
836|"and discharging Jane, who rolled like a football to the feet of the"|FALSE
836|"servants."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' said Cyril, firmly, when the cook's hysterics had become quieter,"|FALSE
836|"and the housemaid had time to say what she thought of them, 'don't you"|FALSE
836|"begin jawing us. We aren't going to stand it. We know too much. You'll"|FALSE
836|"please make an extra special treacle roley for dinner, and we'll have a"|FALSE
836|"tinned tongue.'"|FALSE
836|"'I daresay,' said the housemaid, indignant, still in her outdoor things"|FALSE
836|"and with her hat very much on one side. 'Don't you come a-threatening"|FALSE
836|"me, Master Cyril, because I won't stand it, so I tell you. You tell"|FALSE
836|"your ma about us being out? Much I care! She'll be sorry for me when she"|FALSE
836|"hears about my dear great-aunt by marriage as brought me up from a child"|FALSE
836|"and was a mother to me. She sent for me, she did, she wasn't expected"|FALSE
836|"to last the night, from the spasms going to her legs--and cook was that"|FALSE
836|"kind and careful she couldn't let me go alone, so--'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't,' said Anthea, in real distress. 'You know where liars go to,"|FALSE
836|"Eliza--at least if you don't--'"|FALSE
836|"'Liars indeed!' said Eliza, 'I won't demean myself talking to you.'"|FALSE
836|"'How's Mrs Wigson?' said Robert, 'and DID you keep it up last night?'"|FALSE
836|"The mouth of the housemaid fell open."|FALSE
836|"'Did you doss with Maria or Emily?' asked Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'How did Mrs Prosser enjoy herself?' asked Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Forbear,' said Cyril, 'they've had enough. Whether we tell or not"|FALSE
836|"depends on your later life,' he went on, addressing the servants. 'If"|FALSE
836|"you are decent to us we'll be decent to you. You'd better make that"|FALSE
836|"treacle roley--and if I were you, Eliza, I'd do a little housework and"|FALSE
836|"cleaning, just for a change.'"|FALSE
836|"The servants gave in once and for all."|FALSE
836|"'There's nothing like firmness,' Cyril went on, when the breakfast"|FALSE
836|"things were cleared away and the children were alone in the nursery."|FALSE
836|"'People are always talking of difficulties with servants. It's quite"|FALSE
836|"simple, when you know the way. We can do what we like now and they won't"|FALSE
836|"peach. I think we've broken THEIR proud spirit. Let's go somewhere by"|FALSE
836|"carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'I wouldn't if I were you,' said the Phoenix, yawning, as it swooped"|FALSE
836|"down from its roost on the curtain pole. 'I've given you one or two"|FALSE
836|"hints, but now concealment is at an end, and I see I must speak out.'"|FALSE
836|"It perched on the back of a chair and swayed to and fro, like a parrot"|FALSE
836|"on a swing."|FALSE
836|"'What's the matter now?' said Anthea. She was not quite so gentle as"|FALSE
836|"usual, because she was still weary from the excitement of last night's"|FALSE
836|"cats. 'I'm tired of things happening. I shan't go anywhere on the"|FALSE
836|"carpet. I'm going to darn my stockings.'"|FALSE
836|"'Darn!' said the Phoenix, 'darn! From those young lips these strange"|FALSE
836|"expressions--'"|FALSE
836|"'Mend, then,' said Anthea, 'with a needle and wool.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix opened and shut its wings thoughtfully."|FALSE
836|"'Your stockings,' it said, 'are much less important than they now appear"|FALSE
836|"to you. But the carpet--look at the bare worn patches, look at the great"|FALSE
836|"rent at yonder corner. The carpet has been your faithful friend--your"|FALSE
836|"willing servant. How have you requited its devoted service?'"|FALSE
836|"'Dear Phoenix,' Anthea urged, 'don't talk in that horrid lecturing tone."|FALSE
836|"You make me feel as if I'd done something wrong. And really it is a"|FALSE
836|"wishing carpet, and we haven't done anything else to it--only wishes.'"|FALSE
836|"'Only wishes,' repeated the Phoenix, ruffling its neck feathers angrily,"|FALSE
836|"'and what sort of wishes? Wishing people to be in a good temper, for"|FALSE
836|"instance. What carpet did you ever hear of that had such a wish asked"|FALSE
836|"of it? But this noble fabric, on which you trample so recklessly' (every"|FALSE
836|"one removed its boots from the carpet and stood on the linoleum), 'this"|FALSE
836|"carpet never flinched. It did what you asked, but the wear and tear must"|FALSE
836|"have been awful. And then last night--I don't blame you about the cats"|FALSE
836|"and the rats, for those were its own choice; but what carpet could stand"|FALSE
836|"a heavy cow hanging on to it at one corner?'"|FALSE
836|"'I should think the cats and rats were worse,' said Robert, 'look at all"|FALSE
836|"their claws.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said the bird, 'eleven thousand nine hundred and forty of them--I"|FALSE
836|"daresay you noticed? I should be surprised if these had not left their"|FALSE
836|"mark.'"|FALSE
836|"'Good gracious,' said Jane, sitting down suddenly on the floor, and"|FALSE
836|"patting the edge of the carpet softly; 'do you mean it's WEARING OUT?'"|FALSE
836|"'Its life with you has not been a luxurious one,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'French mud twice. Sand of sunny shores twice. Soaking in southern seas"|FALSE
836|"once. India once. Goodness knows where in Persia once. Musk-rat-land"|FALSE
836|"once. And once, wherever the cow came from. Hold your carpet up to the"|FALSE
836|"light, and with cautious tenderness, if YOU please.'"|FALSE
836|"With cautious tenderness the boys held the carpet up to the light; the"|FALSE
836|"girls looked, and a shiver of regret ran through them as they saw how"|FALSE
836|"those eleven thoousand nine hundred and forty claws had run through the"|FALSE
836|"carpet. It was full of little holes: there were some large ones, and"|FALSE
836|"more than one thin place. At one corner a strip of it was torn, and hung"|FALSE
836|"forlornly."|FALSE
836|"'We must mend it,' said Anthea; 'never mind about my stockings. I can"|FALSE
836|"sew them up in lumps with sewing cotton if there's no time to do them"|FALSE
836|"properly. I know it's awful and no girl would who respected herself,"|FALSE
836|"and all that; but the poor dear carpet's more important than my silly"|FALSE
836|"stockings. Let's go out now this very minute.'"|FALSE
836|"So out they all went, and bought wool to mend the carpet; but there"|FALSE
836|"is no shop in Camden Town where you can buy wishing-wool, no, nor in"|FALSE
836|"Kentish Town either. However, ordinary Scotch heather-mixture fingering"|FALSE
836|"seemed good enough, and this they bought, and all that day Jane and"|FALSE
836|"Anthea darned and darned and darned. The boys went out for a walk in"|FALSE
836|"the afternoon, and the gentle Phoenix paced up and down the table--for"|FALSE
836|"exercise, as it said--and talked to the industrious girls about their"|FALSE
836|"carpet."|FALSE
836|"'It is not an ordinary, ignorant, innocent carpet from Kidderminster,'"|FALSE
836|"it said, 'it is a carpet with a past--a Persian past. Do you know that"|FALSE
836|"in happier years, when that carpet was the property of caliphs, viziers,"|FALSE
836|"kings, and sultans, it never lay on a floor?'"|FALSE
836|"'I thought the floor was the proper home of a carpet,' Jane interrupted."|FALSE
836|"'Not of a MAGIC carpet,' said the Phoenix; 'why, if it had been allowed"|FALSE
836|"to lie about on floors there wouldn't be much of it left now. No,"|FALSE
836|"indeed! It has lived in chests of cedarwood, inlaid with pearl and"|FALSE
836|"ivory, wrapped in priceless tissues of cloth of gold, embroidered with"|FALSE
836|"gems of fabulous value. It has reposed in the sandal-wood caskets of"|FALSE
836|"princesses, and in the rose-attar-scented treasure-houses of kings."|FALSE
836|"Never, never, had any one degraded it by walking on it--except in the"|FALSE
836|"way of business, when wishes were required, and then they always took"|FALSE
836|"their shoes off. And YOU--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, DON'T!' said Jane, very near tears. 'You know you'd never have been"|FALSE
836|"hatched at all if it hadn't been for mother wanting a carpet for us to"|FALSE
836|"walk on.'"|FALSE
836|"'You needn't have walked so much or so hard!' said the bird, 'but"|FALSE
836|"come, dry that crystal tear, and I will relate to you the story of the"|FALSE
836|"Princess Zulieka, the Prince of Asia, and the magic carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'Relate away,' said Anthea--'I mean, please do.'"|FALSE
836|"'The Princess Zulieka, fairest of royal ladies,' began the bird, 'had in"|FALSE
836|"her cradle been the subject of several enchantments. Her grandmother had"|FALSE
836|"been in her day--'"|FALSE
836|"But what in her day Zulieka's grandmother had been was destined never to"|FALSE
836|"be revealed, for Cyril and Robert suddenly burst into the room, and on"|FALSE
836|"each brow were the traces of deep emotion. On Cyril's pale brow stood"|FALSE
836|"beads of agitation and perspiration, and on the scarlet brow of Robert"|FALSE
836|"was a large black smear."|FALSE
836|"'What ails ye both?' asked the Phoenix, and it added tartly that"|FALSE
836|"story-telling was quite impossible if people would come interrupting"|FALSE
836|"like that."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, do shut up, for any sake!' said Cyril, sinking into a chair."|FALSE
836|"Robert smoothed the ruffled golden feathers, adding kindly--"|FALSE
836|"'Squirrel doesn't mean to be a beast. It's only that the MOST AWFUL"|FALSE
836|"thing has happened, and stories don't seem to matter so much. Don't be"|FALSE
836|"cross. You won't be when you've heard what's happened.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, what HAS happened?' said the bird, still rather crossly; and"|FALSE
836|"Anthea and Jane paused with long needles poised in air, and long"|FALSE
836|"needlefuls of Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool drooping from them."|FALSE
836|"'The most awful thing you can possibly think of,' said Cyril. 'That nice"|FALSE
836|"chap--our own burglar--the police have got him, on suspicion of stolen"|FALSE

836|"'Oh, begin at the beginning!' cried Anthea impatiently."|FALSE
836|"'Well, then, we went out, and down by where the undertaker's is, with"|FALSE
836|"the china flowers in the window--you know. There was a crowd, and of"|FALSE

836|"'Don't be a pudding-head,' Cyril advised. 'A fat lot of good it would"|FALSE

836|"'At the police-station,' said Robert, for Cyril was out of breath. 'The"|FALSE

836|"'There must be something we could do,' said Jane, sniffing very"|FALSE
836|"much--'my own dear pet burglar! I can't bear it. And he was so nice,"|FALSE

836|"'That would be ages and ages,' said Cyril, 'and we couldn't conceal him"|FALSE
836|"here. Father might come home at any moment, and if he found the burglar"|FALSE
836|"here HE wouldn't believe the true truth any more than the police would."|FALSE
836|"That's the worst of the truth. Nobody ever believes it. Couldn't we take"|FALSE
836|"him somewhere else?'"|FALSE
836|"Jane clapped her hands."|FALSE
836|"'The sunny southern shore!' she cried, 'where the cook is being queen."|FALSE
836|"He and she would be company for each other!'"|FALSE
836|"And really the idea did not seem bad, if only he would consent to go."|FALSE

836|"sunny southern sea."|FALSE
836|"The servants were tired after Mrs Wigson's party, so every one went to"|FALSE
836|"bed early, and when the Phoenix reported that both servants were snoring"|FALSE
836|"in a heartfelt and candid manner, the children got up--they had never"|FALSE
836|"undressed; just putting their nightgowns on over their things had been"|FALSE
836|"enough to deceive Eliza when she came to turn out the gas. So they were"|FALSE
836|"ready for anything, and they stood on the carpet and said--"|FALSE
836|"'I wish we were in our burglar's lonely cell.' and instantly they were."|FALSE
836|"I think every one had expected the cell to be the 'deepest dungeon below"|FALSE
836|"the castle moat'. I am sure no one had doubted that the burglar, chained"|FALSE
836|"by heavy fetters to a ring in the damp stone wall, would be tossing"|FALSE
836|"uneasily on a bed of straw, with a pitcher of water and a mouldering"|FALSE
836|"crust, untasted, beside him. Robert, remembering the underground passage"|FALSE
836|"and the treasure, had brought a candle and matches, but these were not"|FALSE
836|"needed."|FALSE
836|"The cell was a little white-washed room about twelve feet long and"|FALSE
836|"six feet wide. On one side of it was a sort of shelf sloping a little"|FALSE
836|"towards the wall. On this were two rugs, striped blue and yellow, and a"|FALSE
836|"water-proof pillow. Rolled in the rugs, and with his head on the pillow,"|FALSE
836|"lay the burglar, fast asleep. (He had had his tea, though this the"|FALSE
836|"children did not know--it had come from the coffee-shop round the"|FALSE
836|"corner, in very thick crockery.) The scene was plainly revealed by the"|FALSE
836|"light of a gas-lamp in the passage outside, which shone into the cell"|FALSE
836|"through a pane of thick glass over the door."|FALSE
836|"'I shall gag him,' said Cyril, 'and Robert will hold him down. Anthea"|FALSE
836|"and Jane and the Phoenix can whisper soft nothings to him while he"|FALSE
836|"gradually awakes.'"|FALSE
836|"This plan did not have the success it deserved, because the burglar,"|FALSE
836|"curiously enough, was much stronger, even in his sleep, than Robert and"|FALSE
836|"Cyril, and at the first touch of their hands he leapt up and shouted out"|FALSE
836|"something very loud indeed."|FALSE
836|"Instantly steps were heard outside. Anthea threw her arms round the"|FALSE
836|"burglar and whispered--"|FALSE
836|"'It's us--the ones that gave you the cats. We've come to save you, only"|FALSE
836|"don't let on we're here. Can't we hide somewhere?'"|FALSE
836|"Heavy boots sounded on the flagged passage outside, and a firm voice"|FALSE
836|"shouted--"|FALSE
836|"'Here--you--stop that row, will you?'"|FALSE
836|"'All right, governor,' replied the burglar, still with Anthea's arms"|FALSE
836|"round him; 'I was only a-talking in my sleep. No offence.'"|FALSE
836|"It was an awful moment. Would the boots and the voice come in. Yes! No!"|FALSE
836|"The voice said--"|FALSE
836|"'Well, stow it, will you?'"|FALSE
836|"And the boots went heavily away, along the passage and up some sounding"|FALSE
836|"stone stairs."|FALSE
836|"'Now then,' whispered Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'How the blue Moses did you get in?' asked the burglar, in a hoarse"|FALSE
836|"whisper of amazement."|FALSE
836|"'On the carpet,' said Jane, truly."|FALSE
836|"'Stow that,' said the burglar. 'One on you I could 'a' swallowed, but"|FALSE
836|"four--AND a yellow fowl.'"|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Cyril, sternly, 'you wouldn't have believed any one if"|FALSE
836|"they'd told you beforehand about your finding a cow and all those cats"|FALSE
836|"in our nursery.'"|FALSE
836|"'That I wouldn't,' said the burglar, with whispered fervour, 'so help me"|FALSE
836|"Bob, I wouldn't.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, then,' Cyril went on, ignoring this appeal to his brother, 'just"|FALSE
836|"try to believe what we tell you and act accordingly. It can't do you any"|FALSE
836|"HARM, you know,' he went on in hoarse whispered earnestness. 'You can't"|FALSE
836|"be very much worse off than you are now, you know. But if you'll just"|FALSE
836|"trust to us we'll get you out of this right enough. No one saw us come"|FALSE
836|"in. The question is, where would you like to go?'"|FALSE
836|"'I'd like to go to Boolong,' was the instant reply of the burglar. 'I've"|FALSE
836|"always wanted to go on that there trip, but I've never 'ad the ready at"|FALSE
836|"the right time of the year.'"|FALSE
836|"'Boolong is a town like London,' said Cyril, well meaning, but"|FALSE
836|"inaccurate, 'how could you get a living there?'"|FALSE
836|"The burglar scratched his head in deep doubt."|FALSE
836|"'It's 'ard to get a 'onest living anywheres nowadays,' he said, and his"|FALSE
836|"voice was sad."|FALSE
836|"'Yes, isn't it?' said Jane, sympathetically; 'but how about a sunny"|FALSE
836|"southern shore, where there's nothing to do at all unless you want to.'"|FALSE
836|"'That's my billet, miss,' replied the burglar. 'I never did care about"|FALSE
836|"work--not like some people, always fussing about.'"|FALSE
836|"'Did you never like any sort of work?' asked Anthea, severely."|FALSE
836|"'Lor', lumme, yes,' he answered, 'gardening was my 'obby, so it was. But"|FALSE
836|"father died afore 'e could bind me to a nurseryman, an'--'"|FALSE
836|"'We'll take you to the sunny southern shore,' said Jane; 'you've no idea"|FALSE
836|"what the flowers are like.'"|FALSE
836|"'Our old cook's there,' said Anthea. 'She's queen--'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, chuck it,' the burglar whispered, clutching at his head with both"|FALSE
836|"hands. 'I knowed the first minute I see them cats and that cow as it was"|FALSE
836|"a judgement on me. I don't know now whether I'm a-standing on my hat or"|FALSE
836|"my boots, so help me I don't. If you CAN get me out, get me, and if you"|FALSE
836|"can't, get along with you for goodness' sake, and give me a chanst"|FALSE
836|"to think about what'll be most likely to go down with the Beak in the"|FALSE
836|"morning.'"|FALSE
836|"'Come on to the carpet, then,' said Anthea, gently shoving. The others"|FALSE
836|"quietly pulled, and the moment the feet of the burglar were planted on"|FALSE
836|"the carpet Anthea wished:"|FALSE
836|"'I wish we were all on the sunny southern shore where cook is.'"|FALSE
836|"And instantly they were. There were the rainbow sands, the tropic"|FALSE
836|"glories of leaf and flower, and there, of course, was the cook, crowned"|FALSE
836|"with white flowers, and with all the wrinkles of crossness and tiredness"|FALSE
836|"and hard work wiped out of her face."|FALSE
836|"'Why, cook, you're quite pretty!' Anthea said, as soon as she had got"|FALSE
836|"her breath after the tumble-rush-whirl of the carpet. The burglar stood"|FALSE
836|"rubbing his eyes in the brilliant tropic sunlight, and gazing wildly"|FALSE
836|"round him on the vivid hues of the tropic land."|FALSE
836|"'Penny plain and tuppence coloured!' he exclaimed pensively, 'and well"|FALSE
836|"worth any tuppence, however hard-earned.'"|FALSE
836|"The cook was seated on a grassy mound with her court of copper-coloured"|FALSE
836|"savages around her. The burglar pointed a grimy finger at these."|FALSE
836|"'Are they tame?' he asked anxiously. 'Do they bite or scratch, or do"|FALSE
836|"anything to yer with poisoned arrows or oyster shells or that?'"|FALSE
836|"'Don't you be so timid,' said the cook. 'Look'e 'ere, this 'ere's only"|FALSE
836|"a dream what you've come into, an' as it's only a dream there's no"|FALSE
836|"nonsense about what a young lady like me ought to say or not, so I'll"|FALSE
836|"say you're the best-looking fellow I've seen this many a day. And the"|FALSE
836|"dream goes on and on, seemingly, as long as you behaves. The things what"|FALSE
836|"you has to eat and drink tastes just as good as real ones, and--'"|FALSE
836|"'Look 'ere,' said the burglar, 'I've come 'ere straight outer the pleece"|FALSE
836|"station. These 'ere kids'll tell you it ain't no blame er mine.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, you WERE a burglar, you know,' said the truthful Anthea gently."|FALSE
836|"'Only because I was druv to it by dishonest blokes, as well you knows,"|FALSE

836|"as I've known for years.'"|FALSE
836|"'Wouldn't you like a bath?' asked the queen, 'and some white clothes"|FALSE
836|"like me?'"|FALSE
836|"'I should only look a juggins in 'em, miss, thanking you all the same,'"|FALSE
836|"was the reply; 'but a bath I wouldn't resist, and my shirt was only"|FALSE
836|"clean on week before last.'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril and Robert led him to a rocky pool, where he bathed luxuriously."|FALSE
836|"Then, in shirt and trousers he sat on the sand and spoke."|FALSE
836|"'That cook, or queen, or whatever you call her--her with the white bokay"|FALSE
836|"on her 'ed--she's my sort. Wonder if she'd keep company!'"|FALSE
836|"'I should ask her.'"|FALSE
836|"'I was always a quick hitter,' the man went on; 'it's a word and a blow"|FALSE
836|"with me. I will.'"|FALSE
836|"In shirt and trousers, and crowned with a scented flowery wreath which"|FALSE
836|"Cyril hastily wove as they returned to the court of the queen, the"|FALSE
836|"burglar stood before the cook and spoke."|FALSE
836|"'Look 'ere, miss,' he said. 'You an' me being' all forlorn-like, both on"|FALSE
836|"us, in this 'ere dream, or whatever you calls it, I'd like to tell you"|FALSE
836|"straight as I likes yer looks.'"|FALSE
836|"The cook smiled and looked down bashfully."|FALSE
836|"'I'm a single man--what you might call a batcheldore. I'm mild in my"|FALSE
836|"'abits, which these kids'll tell you the same, and I'd like to 'ave the"|FALSE
836|"pleasure of walkin' out with you next Sunday.'"|FALSE
836|"'Lor!' said the queen cook, ''ow sudden you are, mister.'"|FALSE
836|"'Walking out means you're going to be married,' said Anthea. 'Why not"|FALSE
836|"get married and have done with it? _I_ would.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't mind if I do,' said the burglar. But the cook said--"|FALSE
836|"'No, miss. Not me, not even in a dream. I don't say anythink ag'in the"|FALSE
836|"young chap's looks, but I always swore I'd be married in church, if at"|FALSE
836|"all--and, anyway, I don't believe these here savages would know how"|FALSE
836|"to keep a registering office, even if I was to show them. No, mister,"|FALSE
836|"thanking you kindly, if you can't bring a clergyman into the dream I'll"|FALSE
836|"live and die like what I am.'"|FALSE
836|"'Will you marry her if we get a clergyman?' asked the match-making"|FALSE

836|"'I'm agreeable, miss, I'm sure,' said he, pulling his wreath straight."|FALSE
836|"''Ow this 'ere bokay do tiddle a chap's ears to be sure!'"|FALSE
836|"So, very hurriedly, the carpet was spread out, and instructed to fetch"|FALSE
836|"a clergyman. The instructions were written on the inside of Cyril's cap"|FALSE
836|"with a piece of billiard chalk Robert had got from the marker at the"|FALSE
836|"hotel at Lyndhurst. The carpet disappeared, and more quickly than you"|FALSE
836|"would have thought possible it came back, bearing on its bosom the"|FALSE
836|"Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop."|FALSE
836|"The Reverend Septimus was rather a nice young man, but very much mazed"|FALSE
836|"and muddled, because when he saw a strange carpet laid out at his feet,"|FALSE
836|"in his own study, he naturally walked on it to examine it more closely."|FALSE
836|"And he happened to stand on one of the thin places that Jane and Anthea"|FALSE
836|"had darned, so that he was half on wishing carpet and half on plain"|FALSE
836|"Scotch heather-mixture fingering, which has no magic properties at all."|FALSE
836|"The effect of this was that he was only half there--so that the children"|FALSE
836|"could just see through him, as though he had been a ghost. And as for"|FALSE
836|"him, he saw the sunny southern shore, the cook and the burglar and the"|FALSE
836|"children quite plainly; but through them all he saw, quite plainly also,"|FALSE
836|"his study at home, with the books and the pictures and the marble clock"|FALSE
836|"that had been presented to him when he left his last situation."|FALSE
836|"He seemed to himself to be in a sort of insane fit, so that it did not"|FALSE
836|"matter what he did--and he married the burglar to the cook. The cook"|FALSE
836|"said that she would rather have had a solider kind of a clergyman, one"|FALSE
836|"that you couldn't see through so plain, but perhaps this was real enough"|FALSE
836|"for a dream."|FALSE
836|"And of course the clergyman, though misty, was really real, and able"|FALSE
836|"to marry people, and he did. When the ceremony was over the clergyman"|FALSE
836|"wandered about the island collecting botanical specimens, for he was a"|FALSE
836|"great botanist, and the ruling passion was strong even in an insane fit."|FALSE
836|"There was a splendid wedding feast. Can you fancy Jane and Anthea,"|FALSE
836|"and Robert and Cyril, dancing merrily in a ring, hand-in-hand with"|FALSE
836|"copper-coloured savages, round the happy couple, the queen cook and the"|FALSE
836|"burglar consort? There were more flowers gathered and thrown than you"|FALSE
836|"have ever even dreamed of, and before the children took carpet for home"|FALSE
836|"the now married-and-settled burglar made a speech."|FALSE
836|"'Ladies and gentlemen,' he said, 'and savages of both kinds, only I know"|FALSE
836|"you can't understand what I'm a saying of, but we'll let that pass."|FALSE
836|"If this is a dream, I'm on. If it ain't, I'm onner than ever. If it's"|FALSE
836|"betwixt and between--well, I'm honest, and I can't say more. I don't"|FALSE
836|"want no more 'igh London society--I've got some one to put my arm around"|FALSE
836|"of; and I've got the whole lot of this 'ere island for my allotment, and"|FALSE
836|"if I don't grow some broccoli as'll open the judge's eye at the cottage"|FALSE

836|"fourpence or fippence for mixed kale, only I ain't got a brown, so I"|FALSE
836|"don't deceive you. And there's one thing more, you might take away the"|FALSE
836|"parson. I don't like things what I can see 'alf through, so here's how!'"|FALSE
836|"He drained a coconut-shell of palm wine."|FALSE
836|"It was now past midnight--though it was tea-time on the island."|FALSE
836|"With all good wishes the children took their leave. They also collected"|FALSE
836|"the clergyman and took him back to his study and his presentation clock."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix kindly carried the seeds next day to the burglar and his"|FALSE

836|"mystery."|FALSE
836|"As for the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop, he felt that he had had a"|FALSE
836|"very insane fit indeed, and he was sure it was due to over-study. So he"|FALSE
836|"planned a little dissipation, and took his two maiden aunts to Paris,"|FALSE
836|"where they enjoyed a dazzling round of museums and picture galleries,"|FALSE
836|"and came back feeling that they had indeed seen life. He never told his"|FALSE

836|"Pole, or somewhere really interesting.'"|FALSE
836|"'No,' said the girls together, 'there must be SOME way.'"|FALSE
836|"'Wait a sec,' Anthea added. 'I've got an idea coming. Don't speak.'"|FALSE
836|"There was a silence as she paused with the darning-needle in the air!"|FALSE
836|"Suddenly she spoke:"|FALSE
836|"'I see. Let's tell the carpet to take us somewhere where we can get the"|FALSE
836|"money for mother's present, and--and--and get it some way that she'll"|FALSE
836|"believe in and not think wrong.'"|FALSE
836|"'Well, I must say you are learning the way to get the most out of the"|FALSE
836|"carpet,' said Cyril. He spoke more heartily and kindly than usual,"|FALSE
836|"because he remembered how Anthea had refrained from snarking him about"|FALSE
836|"tearing the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said the Phoenix, 'you certainly are. And you have to remember"|FALSE
836|"that if you take a thing out it doesn't stay in.'"|FALSE
836|"No one paid any attention to this remark at the time, but afterwards"|FALSE
836|"every one thought of it."|FALSE
836|"'Do hurry up, Panther,' said Robert; and that was why Anthea did hurry"|FALSE
836|"up, and why the big darn in the middle of the carpet was all open and"|FALSE
836|"webby like a fishing net, not tight and close like woven cloth, which is"|FALSE
836|"what a good, well-behaved darn should be."|FALSE
836|"Then every one put on its outdoor things, the Phoenix fluttered on to"|FALSE
836|"the mantelpiece and arranged its golden feathers in the glass, and all"|FALSE
836|"was ready. Every one got on to the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Please go slowly, dear carpet,' Anthea began; we like to see where"|FALSE
836|"we're going.' And then she added the difficult wish that had been"|FALSE
836|"decided on."|FALSE
836|"Next moment the carpet, stiff and raftlike, was sailing over the roofs"|FALSE
836|"of Kentish Town."|FALSE
836|"'I wish--No, I don't mean that. I mean it's a PITY we aren't higher up,'"|FALSE
836|"said Anthea, as the edge of the carpet grazed a chimney-pot."|FALSE
836|"'That's right. Be careful,' said the Phoenix, in warning tones. 'If you"|FALSE
836|"wish when you're on a wishing carpet, you DO wish, and there's an end of"|FALSE
836|"it.'"|FALSE
836|"So for a short time no one spoke, and the carpet sailed on in calm"|FALSE
836|"magnificence over St Pancras and King's Cross stations and over the"|FALSE
836|"crowded streets of Clerkenwell."|FALSE
836|"'We're going out Greenwich way,' said Cyril, as they crossed the streak"|FALSE
836|"of rough, tumbled water that was the Thames. 'We might go and have a"|FALSE
836|"look at the Palace.'"|FALSE
836|"On and on the carpet swept, still keeping much nearer to the"|FALSE
836|"chimney-pots than the children found at all comfortable. And then, just"|FALSE
836|"over New Cross, a terrible thing happened."|FALSE
836|"Jane and Robert were in the middle of the carpet. Part of them was"|FALSE
836|"on the carpet, and part of them--the heaviest part--was on the great"|FALSE
836|"central darn."|FALSE
836|"'It's all very misty,' said Jane; 'it looks partly like out of doors"|FALSE
836|"and partly like in the nursery at home. I feel as if I was going to have"|FALSE
836|"measles; everything looked awfully rum then, remember.'"|FALSE
836|"'I feel just exactly the same,' Robert said."|FALSE
836|"'It's the hole,' said the Phoenix; 'it's not measles whatever that"|FALSE
836|"possession may be.'"|FALSE
836|"And at that both Robert and Jane suddenly, and at once, made a bound to"|FALSE
836|"try and get on to the safer part of the carpet, and the darn gave way"|FALSE
836|"and their boots went up, and the heavy heads and bodies of them went"|FALSE
836|"down through the hole, and they landed in a position something between"|FALSE
836|"sitting and sprawling on the flat leads on the top of a high, grey,"|FALSE
836|"gloomy, respectable house whose address was 705, Amersham Road, New"|FALSE
836|"Cross."|FALSE
836|"The carpet seemed to awaken to new energy as soon as it had got rid of"|FALSE
836|"their weight, and it rose high in the air. The others lay down flat and"|FALSE
836|"peeped over the edge of the rising carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Are you hurt?' cried Cyril, and Robert shouted 'No,' and next moment"|FALSE
836|"the carpet had sped away, and Jane and Robert were hidden from the sight"|FALSE
836|"of the others by a stack of smoky chimneys."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, how awful!' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'It might have been worse,' said the Phoenix. 'What would have been"|FALSE
836|"the sentiments of the survivors if that darn had given way when we were"|FALSE
836|"crossing the river?'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, there's that,' said Cyril, recovering himself. 'They'll be all"|FALSE
836|"right. They'll howl till some one gets them down, or drop tiles into"|FALSE
836|"the front garden to attract attention of passersby. Bobs has got my"|FALSE
836|"one-and-fivepence--lucky you forgot to mend that hole in my pocket,"|FALSE
836|"Panther, or he wouldn't have had it. They can tram it home.'"|FALSE
836|"But Anthea would not be comforted."|FALSE
836|"'It's all my fault,' she said. 'I KNEW the proper way to darn, and I"|FALSE
836|"didn't do it. It's all my fault. Let's go home and patch the carpet with"|FALSE
836|"your Etons--something really strong--and send it to fetch them.'"|FALSE
836|"'All right,' said Cyril; 'but your Sunday jacket is stronger than my"|FALSE
836|"Etons. We must just chuck mother's present, that's all. I wish--'"|FALSE
836|"'Stop!' cried the Phoenix; 'the carpet is dropping to earth.'"|FALSE
836|"And indeed it was."|FALSE
836|"It sank swiftly, yet steadily, and landed on the pavement of the"|FALSE
836|"Deptford Road. It tipped a little as it landed, so that Cyril and Anthea"|FALSE
836|"naturally walked off it, and in an instant it had rolled itself up and"|FALSE
836|"hidden behind a gate-post. It did this so quickly that not a single"|FALSE
836|"person in the Deptford Road noticed it. The Phoenix rustled its way into"|FALSE
836|"the breast of Cyril's coat, and almost at the same moment a well-known"|FALSE
836|"voice remarked--"|FALSE
836|"'Well, I never! What on earth are you doing here?'"|FALSE
836|"They were face to face with their pet uncle--their Uncle Reginald."|FALSE
836|"'We DID think of going to Greenwich Palace and talking about Nelson,'"|FALSE
836|"said Cyril, telling as much of the truth as he thought his uncle could"|FALSE
836|"believe."|FALSE
836|"'And where are the others?' asked Uncle Reginald."|FALSE
836|"'I don't exactly know,' Cyril replied, this time quite truthfully."|FALSE
836|"'Well,' said Uncle Reginald, 'I must fly. I've a case in the County"|FALSE
836|"Court. That's the worst of being a beastly solicitor. One can't take the"|FALSE
836|"chances of life when one gets them. If only I could come with you to the"|FALSE
836|"Painted Hall and give you lunch at the \"Ship\" afterwards! But, alas! it"|FALSE
836|"may not be.'"|FALSE
836|"The uncle felt in his pocket."|FALSE
836|"'_I_ mustn't enjoy myself,' he said, 'but that's no reason why you"|FALSE
836|"shouldn't. Here, divide this by four, and the product ought to give you"|FALSE
836|"some desired result. Take care of yourselves. Adieu.'"|FALSE
836|"And waving a cheery farewell with his neat umbrella, the good and"|FALSE
836|"high-hatted uncle passed away, leaving Cyril and Anthea to exchange"|FALSE
836|"eloquent glances over the shining golden sovereign that lay in Cyril's"|FALSE
836|"hand."|FALSE
836|"'Well!' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'Well!' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'Well!' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'Good old carpet!' said Cyril, joyously."|FALSE
836|"'It WAS clever of it--so adequate and yet so simple,' said the Phoenix,"|FALSE
836|"with calm approval."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, come on home and let's mend the carpet. I am a beast. I'd forgotten"|FALSE
836|"the others just for a minute,' said the conscience-stricken Anthea."|FALSE
836|"They unrolled the carpet quickly and slyly--they did not want to attract"|FALSE
836|"public attention--and the moment their feet were on the carpet Anthea"|FALSE
836|"wished to be at home, and instantly they were."|FALSE
836|"The kindness of their excellent uncle had made it unnecessary for them"|FALSE
836|"to go to such extremes as Cyril's Etons or Anthea's Sunday jacket for"|FALSE
836|"the patching of the carpet."|FALSE
836|"Anthea set to work at once to draw the edges of the broken darn"|FALSE
836|"together, and Cyril hastily went out and bought a large piece of the"|FALSE
836|"marble-patterned American oil-cloth which careful house-wives use to"|FALSE
836|"cover dressers and kitchen tables. It was the strongest thing he could"|FALSE
836|"think of."|FALSE
836|"Then they set to work to line the carpet throughout with the oil-cloth."|FALSE
836|"The nursery felt very odd and empty without the others, and Cyril did"|FALSE
836|"not feel so sure as he had done about their being able to 'tram it'"|FALSE
836|"home. So he tried to help Anthea, which was very good of him, but not"|FALSE
836|"much use to her."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix watched them for a time, but it was plainly growing more and"|FALSE
836|"more restless. It fluffed up its splendid feathers, and stood first on"|FALSE
836|"one gilded claw and then on the other, and at last it said--"|FALSE
836|"'I can bear it no longer. This suspense! My Robert--who set my egg to"|FALSE
836|"hatch--in the bosom of whose Norfolk raiment I have nestled so often and"|FALSE
836|"so pleasantly! I think, if you'll excuse me--'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes--DO,' cried Anthea, 'I wish we'd thought of asking you before.'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril opened the window. The Phoenix flapped its sunbright wings and"|FALSE
836|"vanished."|FALSE
836|"'So THAT'S all right,' said Cyril, taking up his needle and instantly"|FALSE
836|"pricking his hand in a new place."|FALSE
836|"Of course I know that what you have really wanted to know about all this"|FALSE
836|"time is not what Anthea and Cyril did, but what happened to Jane and"|FALSE
836|"Robert after they fell through the carpet on to the leads of the house"|FALSE
836|"which was called number 705, Amersham Road."|FALSE
836|"But I had to tell you the other first. That is one of the most annoying"|FALSE
836|"things about stories, you cannot tell all the different parts of them at"|FALSE
836|"the same time."|FALSE
836|"Robert's first remark when he found himself seated on the damp, cold,"|FALSE
836|"sooty leads was--"|FALSE
836|"'Here's a go!'"|FALSE
836|"Jane's first act was tears."|FALSE
836|"'Dry up, Pussy; don't be a little duffer,' said her brother, kindly,"|FALSE
836|"'it'll be all right.'"|FALSE
836|"And then he looked about, just as Cyril had known he would, for"|FALSE
836|"something to throw down, so as to attract the attention of the wayfarers"|FALSE
836|"far below in the street. He could not find anything. Curiously enough,"|FALSE
836|"there were no stones on the leads, not even a loose tile. The roof was"|FALSE
836|"of slate, and every single slate knew its place and kept it. But, as so"|FALSE
836|"often happens, in looking for one thing he found another. There was a"|FALSE
836|"trap-door leading down into the house."|FALSE
836|"And that trap-door was not fastened."|FALSE
836|"'Stop snivelling and come here, Jane,' he cried, encouragingly. 'Lend a"|FALSE
836|"hand to heave this up. If we can get into the house, we might sneak down"|FALSE
836|"without meeting any one, with luck. Come on.'"|FALSE
836|"They heaved up the door till it stood straight up, and, as they bent to"|FALSE
836|"look into the hole below, the door fell back with a hollow clang on the"|FALSE
836|"leads behind, and with its noise was mingled a blood-curdling scream"|FALSE
836|"from underneath."|FALSE
836|"'Discovered!' hissed Robert. 'Oh, my cats alive!'"|FALSE
836|"They were indeed discovered."|FALSE
836|"They found themselves looking down into an attic, which was also"|FALSE
836|"a lumber-room. It had boxes and broken chairs, old fenders and"|FALSE
836|"picture-frames, and rag-bags hanging from nails."|FALSE
836|"In the middle of the floor was a box, open, half full of clothes. Other"|FALSE
836|"clothes lay on the floor in neat piles. In the middle of the piles of"|FALSE
836|"clothes sat a lady, very fat indeed, with her feet sticking out straight"|FALSE
836|"in front of her. And it was she who had screamed, and who, in fact, was"|FALSE
836|"still screaming."|FALSE
836|"'Don't!' cried Jane, 'please don't! We won't hurt you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Where are the rest of your gang?' asked the lady, stopping short in the"|FALSE
836|"middle of a scream."|FALSE
836|"'The others have gone on, on the wishing carpet,' said Jane truthfully."|FALSE
836|"'The wishing carpet?' said the lady."|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Jane, before Robert could say 'You shut up!' 'You must have"|FALSE
836|"read about it. The Phoenix is with them.'"|FALSE
836|"Then the lady got up, and picking her way carefully between the piles of"|FALSE
836|"clothes she got to the door and through it. She shut it behind her, and"|FALSE
836|"the two children could hear her calling 'Septimus! Septimus!' in a loud"|FALSE
836|"yet frightened way."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' said Robert quickly; 'I'll drop first.'"|FALSE
836|"He hung by his hands and dropped through the trap-door."|FALSE
836|"'Now you. Hang by your hands. I'll catch you. Oh, there's no time for"|FALSE
836|"jaw. Drop, I say.'"|FALSE
836|"Jane dropped."|FALSE
836|"Robert tried to catch her, and even before they had finished the"|FALSE
836|"breathless roll among the piles of clothes, which was what his catching"|FALSE
836|"ended in, he whispered--"|FALSE
836|"'We'll hide--behind those fenders and things; they'll think we've gone"|FALSE
836|"along the roofs. Then, when all is calm, we'll creep down the stairs and"|FALSE
836|"take our chance.'"|FALSE
836|"They hastily hid. A corner of an iron bedstead stuck into Robert's side,"|FALSE
836|"and Jane had only standing room for one foot--but they bore it--and when"|FALSE
836|"the lady came back, not with Septimus, but with another lady, they held"|FALSE
836|"their breath and their hearts beat thickly."|FALSE
836|"'Gone!' said the first lady; 'poor little things--quite mad, my"|FALSE
836|"dear--and at large! We must lock this room and send for the police.'"|FALSE
836|"'Let me look out,' said the second lady, who was, if possible, older"|FALSE
836|"and thinner and primmer than the first. So the two ladies dragged a box"|FALSE
836|"under the trap-door and put another box on the top of it, and then they"|FALSE
836|"both climbed up very carefully and put their two trim, tidy heads out of"|FALSE
836|"the trap-door to look for the 'mad children'."|FALSE
836|"'Now,' whispered Robert, getting the bedstead leg out of his side."|FALSE
836|"They managed to creep out from their hiding-place and out through the"|FALSE
836|"door before the two ladies had done looking out of the trap-door on to"|FALSE
836|"the empty leads."|FALSE
836|"Robert and Jane tiptoed down the stairs--one flight, two flights. Then"|FALSE
836|"they looked over the banisters. Horror! a servant was coming up with a"|FALSE
836|"loaded scuttle."|FALSE
836|"The children with one consent crept swiftly through the first open door."|FALSE
836|"The room was a study, calm and gentlemanly, with rows of books, a"|FALSE
836|"writing table, and a pair of embroidered slippers warming themselves in"|FALSE
836|"the fender. The children hid behind the window-curtains. As they passed"|FALSE
836|"the table they saw on it a missionary-box with its bottom label torn"|FALSE
836|"off, open and empty."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, how awful!' whispered Jane. 'We shall never get away alive.'"|FALSE
836|"'Hush!' said Robert, not a moment too soon, for there were steps on the"|FALSE
836|"stairs, and next instant the two ladies came into the room. They did not"|FALSE
836|"see the children, but they saw the empty missionary box."|FALSE
836|"'I knew it,' said one. 'Selina, it WAS a gang. I was certain of it from"|FALSE
836|"the first. The children were not mad. They were sent to distract our"|FALSE
836|"attention while their confederates robbed the house.'"|FALSE
836|"'I am afraid you are right,' said Selina; 'and WHERE ARE THEY NOW?'"|FALSE
836|"'Downstairs, no doubt, collecting the silver milk-jug and sugar-basin"|FALSE
836|"and the punch-ladle that was Uncle Joe's, and Aunt Jerusha's teaspoons."|FALSE
836|"I shall go down.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, don't be so rash and heroic,' said Selina. 'Amelia, we must call"|FALSE
836|"the police from the window. Lock the door. I WILL--I will--'"|FALSE
836|"The words ended in a yell as Selina, rushing to the window, came face to"|FALSE
836|"face with the hidden children."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, don't!' said Jane; 'how can you be so unkind? We AREN'T burglars,"|FALSE
836|"and we haven't any gang, and we didn't open your missionary-box."|FALSE
836|"We opened our own once, but we didn't have to use the money, so our"|FALSE
836|"consciences made us put it back and--DON'T! Oh, I wish you wouldn't--'"|FALSE
836|"Miss Selina had seized Jane and Miss Amelia captured Robert. The"|FALSE
836|"children found themselves held fast by strong, slim hands, pink at the"|FALSE
836|"wrists and white at the knuckles."|FALSE
836|"'We've got YOU, at any rate,' said Miss Amelia. 'Selina, your captive"|FALSE
836|"is smaller than mine. You open the window at once and call \"Murder!\" as"|FALSE
836|"loud as you can."|FALSE
836|"Selina obeyed; but when she had opened the window, instead of calling"|FALSE
836|"'Murder!' she called 'Septimus!' because at that very moment she saw her"|FALSE
836|"nephew coming in at the gate."|FALSE
836|"In another minute he had let himself in with his latch-key and had"|FALSE
836|"mounted the stairs. As he came into the room Jane and Robert each"|FALSE
836|"uttered a shriek of joy so loud and so sudden that the ladies leaped"|FALSE
836|"with surprise, and nearly let them go."|FALSE
836|"'It's our own clergyman,' cried Jane."|FALSE
836|"'Don't you remember us?' asked Robert. 'You married our burglar for"|FALSE
836|"us--don't you remember?'"|FALSE
836|"'I KNEW it was a gang,' said Amelia. 'Septimus, these abandoned children"|FALSE
836|"are members of a desperate burgling gang who are robbing the house. They"|FALSE
836|"have already forced the missionary-box and purloined its contents.'"|FALSE
836|"The Reverend Septimus passed his hand wearily over his brow."|FALSE
836|"'I feel a little faint,' he said, 'running upstairs so quickly.'"|FALSE
836|"'We never touched the beastly box,' said Robert."|FALSE
836|"'Then your confederates did,' said Miss Selina."|FALSE
836|"'No, no,' said the curate, hastily. '_I_ opened the box myself."|FALSE
836|"This morning I found I had not enough small change for the Mothers'"|FALSE
836|"Independent Unity Measles and Croup Insurance payments. I suppose this"|FALSE
836|"is NOT a dream, is it?'"|FALSE
836|"'Dream? No, indeed. Search the house. I insist upon it.'"|FALSE
836|"The curate, still pale and trembling, searched the house, which, of"|FALSE
836|"course, was blamelessly free of burglars."|FALSE
836|"When he came back he sank wearily into his chair."|FALSE
836|"'Aren't you going to let us go?' asked Robert, with furious indignation,"|FALSE
836|"for there is something in being held by a strong lady that sets the"|FALSE
836|"blood of a boy boiling in his veins with anger and despair. 'We've never"|FALSE
836|"done anything to you. It's all the carpet. It dropped us on the leads."|FALSE
836|"WE couldn't help it. You know how it carried you over to the island, and"|FALSE
836|"you had to marry the burglar to the cook.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, my head!' said the curate."|FALSE
836|"'Never mind your head just now,' said Robert; 'try to be honest and"|FALSE
836|"honourable, and do your duty in that state of life!'"|FALSE
836|"'This is a judgement on me for something, I suppose,' said the Reverend"|FALSE
836|"Septimus, wearily, 'but I really cannot at the moment remember what.'"|FALSE
836|"'Send for the police,' said Miss Selina."|FALSE
836|"'Send for a doctor,' said the curate."|FALSE
836|"'Do you think they ARE mad, then,' said Miss Amelia."|FALSE
836|"'I think I am,' said the curate."|FALSE
836|"Jane had been crying ever since her capture. Now she said-- 'You aren't"|FALSE
836|"now, but perhaps you will be, if--And it would serve you jolly well"|FALSE
836|"right, too.'"|FALSE
836|"'Aunt Selina,' said the curate, 'and Aunt Amelia, believe me, this is"|FALSE
836|"only an insane dream. You will realize it soon. It has happened to me"|FALSE
836|"before. But do not let us be unjust, even in a dream. Do not hold the"|FALSE
836|"children; they have done no harm. As I said before, it was I who opened"|FALSE
836|"the box.'"|FALSE
836|"The strong, bony hands unwillingly loosened their grasp. Robert shook"|FALSE
836|"himself and stood in sulky resentment. But Jane ran to the curate and"|FALSE
836|"embraced him so suddenly that he had not time to defend himself."|FALSE
836|"'You're a dear,' she said. 'It IS like a dream just at first, but you"|FALSE
836|"get used to it. Now DO let us go. There's a good, kind, honourable"|FALSE
836|"clergyman.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't know,' said the Reverend Septimus; 'it's a difficult problem."|FALSE
836|"It is such a very unusual dream. Perhaps it's only a sort of other"|FALSE
836|"life--quite real enough for you to be mad in. And if you're mad, there"|FALSE
836|"might be a dream-asylum where you'd be kindly treated, and in time"|FALSE
836|"restored, cured, to your sorrowing relatives. It is very hard to see"|FALSE
836|"your duty plainly, even in ordinary life, and these dream-circumstances"|FALSE
836|"are so complicated--'"|FALSE
836|"'If it's a dream,' said Robert, 'you will wake up directly, and then"|FALSE
836|"you'd be sorry if you'd sent us into a dream-asylum, because you might"|FALSE
836|"never get into the same dream again and let us out, and so we might stay"|FALSE
836|"there for ever, and then what about our sorrowing relatives who aren't"|FALSE
836|"in the dreams at all?'"|FALSE
836|"But all the curate could now say was, 'Oh, my head!'"|FALSE
836|"And Jane and Robert felt quite ill with helplessness and hopelessness. A"|FALSE
836|"really conscientious curate is a very difficult thing to manage."|FALSE
836|"And then, just as the hopelessness and the helplessness were getting to"|FALSE
836|"be almost more than they could bear, the two children suddenly felt that"|FALSE
836|"extraordinary shrinking feeling that you always have when you are just"|FALSE
836|"going to vanish. And the next moment they had vanished, and the Reverend"|FALSE
836|"Septimus was left alone with his aunts."|FALSE
836|"'I knew it was a dream,' he cried, wildly. 'I've had something like"|FALSE
836|"it before. Did you dream it too, Aunt Selina, and you, Aunt Amelia? I"|FALSE
836|"dreamed that you did, you know.'"|FALSE
836|"Aunt Selina looked at him and then at Aunt Amelia. Then she said"|FALSE
836|"boldly--"|FALSE
836|"'What do you mean? WE haven't been dreaming anything. You must have"|FALSE
836|"dropped off in your chair.'"|FALSE
836|"The curate heaved a sigh of relief."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, if it's only _I_,' he said; 'if we'd all dreamed it I could never"|FALSE
836|"have believed it, never!'"|FALSE
836|"Afterwards Aunt Selina said to the other aunt--"|FALSE
836|"'Yes, I know it was an untruth, and I shall doubtless be punished for it"|FALSE
836|"in due course. But I could see the poor dear fellow's brain giving way"|FALSE
836|"before my very eyes. He couldn't have stood the strain of three dreams."|FALSE
836|"It WAS odd, wasn't it? All three of us dreaming the same thing at the"|FALSE
836|"same moment. We must never tell dear Seppy. But I shall send an account"|FALSE
836|"of it to the Psychical Society, with stars instead of names, you know.'"|FALSE
836|"And she did. And you can read all about it in one of the society's fat"|FALSE
836|"Blue-books."|FALSE
836|"Of course, you understand what had happened? The intelligent Phoenix had"|FALSE
836|"simply gone straight off to the Psammead, and had wished Robert and Jane"|FALSE
836|"at home. And, of course, they were at home at once. Cyril and Anthea had"|FALSE
836|"not half finished mending the carpet."|FALSE
836|"When the joyful emotions of reunion had calmed down a little, they"|FALSE
836|"all went out and spent what was left of Uncle Reginald's sovereign in"|FALSE
836|"presents for mother. They bought her a pink silk handkerchief, a pair of"|FALSE

836|"so like an orange that almost any one you had given it to would have"|FALSE
836|"tried to peel it--if they liked oranges, of course. Also they bought a"|FALSE
836|"cake with icing on, and the rest of the money they spent on flowers to"|FALSE
836|"put in the vases."|FALSE
836|"When they had arranged all the things on a table, with the candles stuck"|FALSE
836|"up on a plate ready to light the moment mother's cab was heard, they"|FALSE

836|"'Ah!' said the Phoenix, 'it is perhaps fortunate for you that I am such"|FALSE

836|"'Well, I MUST say,' mother said, looking at the wishing carpet as it"|FALSE
836|"lay, all darned and mended and backed with shiny American cloth, on the"|FALSE
836|"floor of the nursery--'I MUST say I've never in my life bought such a"|FALSE
836|"bad bargain as that carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"A soft 'Oh!' of contradiction sprang to the lips of Cyril, Robert, Jane,"|FALSE
836|"and Anthea. Mother looked at them quickly, and said--"|FALSE
836|"'Well, of course, I see you've mended it very nicely, and that was sweet"|FALSE
836|"of you, dears.'"|FALSE
836|"'The boys helped too,' said the dears, honourably."|FALSE
836|"'But, still--twenty-two and ninepence! It ought to have lasted for"|FALSE
836|"years. It's simply dreadful now. Well, never mind, darlings, you've"|FALSE
836|"done your best. I think we'll have coconut matting next time. A carpet"|FALSE
836|"doesn't have an easy life of it in this room, does it?'"|FALSE
836|"'It's not our fault, mother, is it, that our boots are the really"|FALSE
836|"reliable kind?' Robert asked the question more in sorrow than in anger."|FALSE
836|"'No, dear, we can't help our boots,' said mother, cheerfully, 'but we"|FALSE
836|"might change them when we come in, perhaps. It's just an idea of mine."|FALSE
836|"I wouldn't dream of scolding on the very first morning after I've come"|FALSE
836|"home. Oh, my Lamb, how could you?'"|FALSE
836|"This conversation was at breakfast, and the Lamb had been beautifully"|FALSE
836|"good until every one was looking at the carpet, and then it was for him"|FALSE
836|"but the work of a moment to turn a glass dish of syrupy blackberry jam"|FALSE
836|"upside down on his young head. It was the work of a good many minutes"|FALSE
836|"and several persons to get the jam off him again, and this interesting"|FALSE
836|"work took people's minds off the carpet, and nothing more was said just"|FALSE
836|"then about its badness as a bargain and about what mother hoped for from"|FALSE
836|"coconut matting."|FALSE
836|"When the Lamb was clean again he had to be taken care of while mother"|FALSE
836|"rumpled her hair and inked her fingers and made her head ache over the"|FALSE
836|"difficult and twisted house-keeping accounts which cook gave her on"|FALSE
836|"dirty bits of paper, and which were supposed to explain how it was that"|FALSE
836|"cook had only fivepence-half-penny and a lot of unpaid bills left out"|FALSE
836|"of all the money mother had sent her for house-keeping. Mother was very"|FALSE
836|"clever, but even she could not quite understand the cook's accounts."|FALSE
836|"The Lamb was very glad to have his brothers and sisters to play with"|FALSE

836|"In this game the baby walks up you, and when he is standing on your"|FALSE

836|"him there, which is the destruction of Pompeii."|FALSE
836|"'All the same, I wish we could decide what we'd better say next time"|FALSE

836|"'Well, you see,' Cyril was saying; 'it's just the old bother. Mother"|FALSE
836|"can't believe the real true truth about the carpet, and--'"|FALSE
836|"'You speak sooth, O Cyril,' remarked the Phoenix, coming out from the"|FALSE
836|"cupboard where the blackbeetles lived, and the torn books, and the"|FALSE
836|"broken slates, and odd pieces of toys that had lost the rest of"|FALSE
836|"themselves. 'Now hear the wisdom of Phoenix, the son of the Phoenix--'"|FALSE
836|"'There is a society called that,' said Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'Where is it? And what is a society?' asked the bird."|FALSE
836|"'It's a sort of joined-together lot of people--a sort of brotherhood--a"|FALSE
836|"kind of--well, something very like your temple, you know, only quite"|FALSE
836|"different.'"|FALSE

836|"'Pretty Polly!' remarked the Lamb, reaching his hands towards the golden"|FALSE

836|"     Of paddling out among the rocks"|FALSE
836|"     And soaking both his bunny socks.'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't think you'd care about the sons of the Phoenix, really,' said"|FALSE
836|"Robert. 'I have heard that they don't do anything fiery. They only drink"|FALSE
836|"a great deal. Much more than other people, because they drink lemonade"|FALSE
836|"and fizzy things, and the more you drink of those the more good you"|FALSE
836|"get.'"|FALSE
836|"'In your mind, perhaps,' said Jane; 'but it wouldn't be good in your"|FALSE
836|"body. You'd get too balloony.'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix yawned."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Anthea; 'I really have an idea. This isn't like a"|FALSE
836|"common carpet. It's very magic indeed. Don't you think, if we put Tatcho"|FALSE
836|"on it, and then gave it a rest, the magic part of it might grow, like"|FALSE
836|"hair is supposed to do?'"|FALSE
836|"'It might,' said Robert; 'but I should think paraffin would do as"|FALSE
836|"well--at any rate as far as the smell goes, and that seems to be the"|FALSE
836|"great thing about Tatcho.'"|FALSE
836|"But with all its faults Anthea's idea was something to do, and they did"|FALSE
836|"it."|FALSE
836|"It was Cyril who fetched the Tatcho bottle from father's washhand-stand."|FALSE
836|"But the bottle had not much in it."|FALSE
836|"'We mustn't take it all,' Jane said, 'in case father's hair began to"|FALSE
836|"come off suddenly. If he hadn't anything to put on it, it might all"|FALSE
836|"drop off before Eliza had time to get round to the chemist's for another"|FALSE
836|"bottle. It would be dreadful to have a bald father, and it would all be"|FALSE
836|"our fault.'"|FALSE
836|"'And wigs are very expensive, I believe,' said Anthea. 'Look here, leave"|FALSE
836|"enough in the bottle to wet father's head all over with in case any"|FALSE
836|"emergency emerges--and let's make up with paraffin. I expect it's the"|FALSE
836|"smell that does the good really--and the smell's exactly the same.'"|FALSE
836|"So a small teaspoonful of the Tatcho was put on the edges of the worst"|FALSE
836|"darn in the carpet and rubbed carefully into the roots of the hairs of"|FALSE
836|"it, and all the parts that there was not enough Tatcho for had paraffin"|FALSE
836|"rubbed into them with a piece of flannel. Then the flannel was burned."|FALSE
836|"It made a gay flame, which delighted the Phoenix and the Lamb."|FALSE
836|"'How often,' said mother, opening the door--'how often am I to tell you"|FALSE
836|"that you are NOT to play with paraffin? What have you been doing?'"|FALSE
836|"'We have burnt a paraffiny rag,' Anthea answered."|FALSE
836|"It was no use telling mother what they had done to the carpet. She did"|FALSE
836|"not know it was a magic carpet, and no one wants to be laughed at for"|FALSE
836|"trying to mend an ordinary carpet with lamp-oil."|FALSE
836|"'Well, don't do it again,' said mother. 'And now, away with melancholy!"|FALSE
836|"Father has sent a telegram. Look!' She held it out, and the children,"|FALSE
836|"holding it by its yielding corners, read--"|FALSE
836|"'Box for kiddies at Garrick. Stalls for us, Haymarket. Meet Charing"|FALSE
836|"Cross, 6.30.'"|FALSE
836|"'That means,' said mother, 'that you're going to see \"The Water Babies\""|FALSE
836|"all by your happy selves, and father and I will take you and fetch you."|FALSE
836|"Give me the Lamb, dear, and you and Jane put clean lace in your red"|FALSE
836|"evening frocks, and I shouldn't wonder if you found they wanted ironing."|FALSE
836|"This paraffin smell is ghastly. Run and get out your frocks.'"|FALSE
836|"The frocks did want ironing--wanted it rather badly, as it happened;"|FALSE
836|"for, being of tomato-Coloured Liberty silk, they had been found very"|FALSE
836|"useful for tableaux vivants when a red dress was required for Cardinal"|FALSE
836|"Richelieu. They were very nice tableaux, these, and I wish I could tell"|FALSE
836|"you about them; but one cannot tell everything in a story. You would"|FALSE
836|"have been specially interested in hearing about the tableau of the"|FALSE
836|"Princes in the Tower, when one of the pillows burst, and the youthful"|FALSE
836|"Princes were so covered with feathers that the picture might very well"|FALSE
836|"have been called 'Michaelmas Eve; or, Plucking the Geese'."|FALSE
836|"Ironing the dresses and sewing the lace in occupied some time, and no"|FALSE
836|"one was dull, because there was the theatre to look forward to, and also"|FALSE
836|"the possible growth of hairs on the carpet, for which every one kept"|FALSE
836|"looking anxiously. By four o'clock Jane was almost sure that several"|FALSE
836|"hairs were beginning to grow."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix perched on the fender, and its conversation, as usual, was"|FALSE
836|"entertaining and instructive--like school prizes are said to be. But it"|FALSE
836|"seemed a little absent-minded, and even a little sad."|FALSE
836|"'Don't you feel well, Phoenix, dear?' asked Anthea, stooping to take an"|FALSE
836|"iron off the fire."|FALSE
836|"'I am not sick,' replied the golden bird, with a gloomy shake of the"|FALSE
836|"head; 'but I am getting old.'"|FALSE
836|"'Why, you've hardly been hatched any time at all.'"|FALSE
836|"'Time,' remarked the Phoenix, 'is measured by heartbeats. I'm sure the"|FALSE
836|"palpitations I've had since I've known you are enough to blanch the"|FALSE
836|"feathers of any bird.'"|FALSE
836|"'But I thought you lived 500 years,' said Robert, and you've hardly"|FALSE
836|"begun this set of years. Think of all the time that's before you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Time,' said the Phoenix, 'is, as you are probably aware, merely a"|FALSE
836|"convenient fiction. There is no such thing as time. I have lived in"|FALSE
836|"these two months at a pace which generously counterbalances 500 years of"|FALSE
836|"life in the desert. I am old, I am weary. I feel as if I ought to lay my"|FALSE
836|"egg, and lay me down to my fiery sleep. But unless I'm careful I shall"|FALSE
836|"be hatched again instantly, and that is a misfortune which I really"|FALSE
836|"do not think I COULD endure. But do not let me intrude these desperate"|FALSE
836|"personal reflections on your youthful happiness. What is the show at the"|FALSE
836|"theatre to-night? Wrestlers? Gladiators? A combat of cameleopards and"|FALSE
836|"unicorns?'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't think so,' said Cyril; 'it's called \"The Water Babies\", and"|FALSE
836|"if it's like the book there isn't any gladiating in it. There are"|FALSE
836|"chimney-sweeps and professors, and a lobster and an otter and a salmon,"|FALSE
836|"and children living in the water.'"|FALSE
836|"'It sounds chilly.' The Phoenix shivered, and went to sit on the tongs."|FALSE
836|"'I don't suppose there will be REAL water,' said Jane. 'And theatres are"|FALSE
836|"very warm and pretty, with a lot of gold and lamps. Wouldn't you like to"|FALSE
836|"come with us?'"|FALSE
836|"'_I_ was just going to say that,' said Robert, in injured tones, 'only"|FALSE
836|"I know how rude it is to interrupt. Do come, Phoenix, old chap; it will"|FALSE
836|"cheer you up. It'll make you laugh like any thing. Mr Bourchier always"|FALSE
836|"makes ripping plays. You ought to have seen \"Shock-headed Peter\" last"|FALSE
836|"year.'"|FALSE
836|"'Your words are strange,' said the Phoenix, 'but I will come with you."|FALSE
836|"The revels of this Bourchier, of whom you speak, may help me to forget"|FALSE
836|"the weight of my years.' So that evening the Phoenix snugged inside the"|FALSE
836|"waistcoat of Robert's Etons--a very tight fit it seemed both to Robert"|FALSE
836|"and to the Phoenix--and was taken to the play."|FALSE
836|"Robert had to pretend to be cold at the glittering, many-mirrored"|FALSE
836|"restaurant where they ate dinner, with father in evening dress, with"|FALSE
836|"a very shiny white shirt-front, and mother looking lovely in her grey"|FALSE
836|"evening dress, that changes into pink and green when she moves. Robert"|FALSE
836|"pretended that he was too cold to take off his great-coat, and so sat"|FALSE
836|"sweltering through what would otherwise have been a most thrilling meal."|FALSE
836|"He felt that he was a blot on the smart beauty of the family, and he"|FALSE
836|"hoped the Phoenix knew what he was suffering for its sake. Of course,"|FALSE
836|"we are all pleased to suffer for the sake of others, but we like them"|FALSE
836|"to know it unless we are the very best and noblest kind of people, and"|FALSE
836|"Robert was just ordinary."|FALSE
836|"Father was full of jokes and fun, and every one laughed all the time,"|FALSE
836|"even with their mouths full, which is not manners. Robert thought father"|FALSE
836|"would not have been quite so funny about his keeping his over-coat on if"|FALSE
836|"father had known all the truth. And there Robert was probably right."|FALSE
836|"When dinner was finished to the last grape and the last paddle in the"|FALSE
836|"finger glasses--for it was a really truly grown-up dinner--the children"|FALSE
836|"were taken to the theatre, guided to a box close to the stage, and left."|FALSE
836|"Father's parting words were: 'Now, don't you stir out of this box,"|FALSE
836|"whatever you do. I shall be back before the end of the play. Be good"|FALSE
836|"and you will be happy. Is this zone torrid enough for the abandonment of"|FALSE
836|"great-coats, Bobs? No? Well, then, I should say you were sickening for"|FALSE
836|"something--mumps or measles or thrush or teething. Goodbye.'"|FALSE
836|"He went, and Robert was at last able to remove his coat, mop his"|FALSE
836|"perspiring brow, and release the crushed and dishevelled Phoenix. Robert"|FALSE
836|"had to arrange his damp hair at the looking-glass at the back of the"|FALSE
836|"box, and the Phoenix had to preen its disordered feathers for some time"|FALSE
836|"before either of them was fit to be seen."|FALSE
836|"They were very, very early. When the lights went up fully, the Phoenix,"|FALSE
836|"balancing itself on the gilded back of a chair, swayed in ecstasy."|FALSE
836|"'How fair a scene is this!' it murmured; 'how far fairer than my temple!"|FALSE
836|"Or have I guessed aright? Have you brought me hither to lift up my heart"|FALSE
836|"with emotions of joyous surprise? Tell me, my Robert, is it not that"|FALSE
836|"this, THIS is my true temple, and the other was but a humble shrine"|FALSE
836|"frequented by outcasts?'"|FALSE
836|"'I don't know about outcasts,' said Robert, 'but you can call this your"|FALSE
836|"temple if you like. Hush! the music is beginning.'"|FALSE
836|"I am not going to tell you about the play. As I said before, one can't"|FALSE
836|"tell everything, and no doubt you saw 'The Water Babies' yourselves. If"|FALSE
836|"you did not it was a shame, or, rather, a pity."|FALSE
836|"What I must tell you is that, though Cyril and Jane and Robert and"|FALSE
836|"Anthea enjoyed it as much as any children possibly could, the pleasure"|FALSE
836|"of the Phoenix was far, far greater than theirs."|FALSE
836|"'This is indeed my temple,' it said again and again. 'What radiant"|FALSE
836|"rites! And all to do honour to me!'"|FALSE
836|"The songs in the play it took to be hymns in its honour. The choruses"|FALSE
836|"were choric songs in its praise. The electric lights, it said, were"|FALSE
836|"magic torches lighted for its sake, and it was so charmed with the"|FALSE
836|"footlights that the children could hardly persuade it to sit still. But"|FALSE
836|"when the limelight was shown it could contain its approval no longer. It"|FALSE
836|"flapped its golden wings, and cried in a voice that could be heard all"|FALSE
836|"over the theatre:"|FALSE
836|"'Well done, my servants! Ye have my favour and my countenance!'"|FALSE
836|"Little Tom on the stage stopped short in what he was saying. A deep"|FALSE
836|"breath was drawn by hundreds of lungs, every eye in the house turned to"|FALSE
836|"the box where the luckless children cringed, and most people hissed, or"|FALSE
836|"said 'Shish!' or 'Turn them out!'"|FALSE
836|"Then the play went on, and an attendant presently came to the box and"|FALSE
836|"spoke wrathfully."|FALSE
836|"'It wasn't us, indeed it wasn't,' said Anthea, earnestly; 'it was the"|FALSE
836|"bird.'"|FALSE
836|"The man said well, then, they must keep their bird very quiet."|FALSE
836|"'Disturbing every one like this,' he said."|FALSE
836|"'It won't do it again,' said Robert, glancing imploringly at the golden"|FALSE
836|"bird; 'I'm sure it won't.'"|FALSE
836|"'You have my leave to depart,' said the Phoenix gently."|FALSE
836|"'Well, he is a beauty, and no mistake,' said the attendant, 'only I'd"|FALSE
836|"cover him up during the acts. It upsets the performance.'"|FALSE
836|"And he went."|FALSE
836|"'Don't speak again, there's a dear,' said Anthea; 'you wouldn't like to"|FALSE
836|"interfere with your own temple, would you?'"|FALSE
836|"So now the Phoenix was quiet, but it kept whispering to the children. It"|FALSE
836|"wanted to know why there was no altar, no fire, no incense, and became"|FALSE
836|"so excited and fretful and tiresome that four at least of the party of"|FALSE
836|"five wished deeply that it had been left at home."|FALSE
836|"What happened next was entirely the fault of the Phoenix. It was not"|FALSE
836|"in the least the fault of the theatre people, and no one could ever"|FALSE
836|"understand afterwards how it did happen. No one, that is, except the"|FALSE
836|"guilty bird itself and the four children. The Phoenix was balancing"|FALSE
836|"itself on the gilt back of the chair, swaying backwards and forwards and"|FALSE
836|"up and down, as you may see your own domestic parrot do. I mean the grey"|FALSE
836|"one with the red tail. All eyes were on the stage, where the lobster"|FALSE
836|"was delighting the audience with that gem of a song, 'If you can't walk"|FALSE
836|"straight, walk sideways!' when the Phoenix murmured warmly--"|FALSE
836|"'No altar, no fire, no incense!' and then, before any of the children"|FALSE
836|"could even begin to think of stopping it, it spread its bright wings and"|FALSE
836|"swept round the theatre, brushing its gleaming feathers against delicate"|FALSE
836|"hangings and gilded woodwork."|FALSE
836|"It seemed to have made but one circular wing-sweep, such as you may see"|FALSE
836|"a gull make over grey water on a stormy day. Next moment it was perched"|FALSE
836|"again on the chair-back--and all round the theatre, where it had passed,"|FALSE
836|"little sparks shone like tinsel seeds, then little smoke wreaths curled"|FALSE
836|"up like growing plants--little flames opened like flower-buds. People"|FALSE
836|"whispered--then people shrieked."|FALSE
836|"'Fire! Fire!' The curtain went down--the lights went up."|FALSE
836|"'Fire!' cried every one, and made for the doors."|FALSE
836|"'A magnificent idea!' said the Phoenix, complacently. 'An enormous"|FALSE
836|"altar--fire supplied free of charge. Doesn't the incense smell"|FALSE
836|"delicious?'"|FALSE
836|"The only smell was the stifling smell of smoke, of burning silk, or"|FALSE
836|"scorching varnish."|FALSE
836|"The little flames had opened now into great flame-flowers. The people in"|FALSE
836|"the theatre were shouting and pressing towards the doors."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, how COULD you!' cried Jane. 'Let's get out.'"|FALSE
836|"'Father said stay here,' said Anthea, very pale, and trying to speak in"|FALSE
836|"her ordinary voice."|FALSE
836|"'He didn't mean stay and be roasted,' said Robert. 'No boys on burning"|FALSE
836|"decks for me, thank you.'"|FALSE
836|"'Not much,' said Cyril, and he opened the door of the box."|FALSE
836|"But a fierce waft of smoke and hot air made him shut it again. It was"|FALSE
836|"not possible to get out that way."|FALSE
836|"They looked over the front of the box. Could they climb down?"|FALSE
836|"It would be possible, certainly; but would they be much better off?"|FALSE
836|"'Look at the people,' moaned Anthea; 'we couldn't get through.'"|FALSE
836|"And, indeed, the crowd round the doors looked as thick as flies in the"|FALSE
836|"jam-making season."|FALSE
836|"'I wish we'd never seen the Phoenix,' cried Jane."|FALSE
836|"Even at that awful moment Robert looked round to see if the bird"|FALSE
836|"had overheard a speech which, however natural, was hardly polite or"|FALSE
836|"grateful."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix was gone."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Cyril, 'I've read about fires in papers; I'm sure it's"|FALSE
836|"all right. Let's wait here, as father said.'"|FALSE
836|"'We can't do anything else,' said Anthea bitterly."|FALSE
836|"'Look here,' said Robert, 'I'm NOT frightened--no, I'm not. The Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"has never been a skunk yet, and I'm certain it'll see us through"|FALSE
836|"somehow. I believe in the Phoenix!'"|FALSE
836|"'The Phoenix thanks you, O Robert,' said a golden voice at his feet, and"|FALSE
836|"there was the Phoenix itself, on the Wishing Carpet."|FALSE
836|"'Quick!' it said. 'Stand on those portions of the carpet which are truly"|FALSE
836|"antique and authentic--and--'"|FALSE
836|"A sudden jet of flame stopped its words. Alas! the Phoenix had"|FALSE
836|"unconsciously warmed to its subject, and in the unintentional heat of"|FALSE
836|"the moment had set fire to the paraffin with which that morning the"|FALSE
836|"children had anointed the carpet. It burned merrily. The children tried"|FALSE
836|"in vain to stamp it out. They had to stand back and let it burn itself"|FALSE
836|"out. When the paraffin had burned away it was found that it had taken"|FALSE
836|"with it all the darns of Scotch heather-mixture fingering. Only the"|FALSE
836|"fabric of the old carpet was left--and that was full of holes."|FALSE

836|"The four children got on to what was left of the carpet. Very careful"|FALSE
836|"they were not to leave a leg or a hand hanging over one of the holes. It"|FALSE
836|"was very hot--the theatre was a pit of fire. Every one else had got out."|FALSE
836|"Jane had to sit on Anthea's lap."|FALSE
836|"'Home!' said Cyril, and instantly the cool draught from under the"|FALSE
836|"nursery door played upon their legs as they sat. They were all on"|FALSE
836|"the carpet still, and the carpet was lying in its proper place on the"|FALSE
836|"nursery floor, as calm and unmoved as though it had never been to the"|FALSE
836|"theatre or taken part in a fire in its life."|FALSE
836|"Four long breaths of deep relief were instantly breathed. The draught"|FALSE
836|"which they had never liked before was for the moment quite pleasant. And"|FALSE
836|"they were safe. And every one else was safe. The theatre had been quite"|FALSE
836|"empty when they left. Every one was sure of that."|FALSE
836|"They presently found themselves all talking at once. Somehow none of"|FALSE

836|"'Did you notice--?' they said, and 'Do you remember--?'"|FALSE
836|"When suddenly Anthea's face turned pale under the dirt which it had"|FALSE
836|"collected on it during the fire."|FALSE
836|"'Oh,' she cried, 'mother and father! Oh, how awful! They'll think we're"|FALSE
836|"burned to cinders. Oh, let's go this minute and tell them we aren't.'"|FALSE
836|"'We should only miss them,' said the sensible Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'Well--YOU go then,' said Anthea, 'or I will. Only do wash your face"|FALSE
836|"first. Mother will be sure to think you are burnt to a cinder if she"|FALSE
836|"sees you as black as that, and she'll faint or be ill or something. Oh,"|FALSE
836|"I wish we'd never got to know that Phoenix.'"|FALSE
836|"'Hush!' said Robert; 'it's no use being rude to the bird. I suppose it"|FALSE
836|"can't help its nature. Perhaps we'd better wash too. Now I come to think"|FALSE
836|"of it my hands are rather--'"|FALSE
836|"No one had noticed the Phoenix since it had bidden them to step on the"|FALSE
836|"carpet. And no one noticed that no one had noticed."|FALSE
836|"All were partially clean, and Cyril was just plunging into his"|FALSE
836|"great-coat to go and look for his parents--he, and not unjustly, called"|FALSE
836|"it looking for a needle in a bundle of hay--when the sound of father's"|FALSE
836|"latchkey in the front door sent every one bounding up the stairs."|FALSE
836|"'Are you all safe?' cried mother's voice; 'are you all safe?' and the"|FALSE
836|"next moment she was kneeling on the linoleum of the hall, trying to"|FALSE
836|"kiss four damp children at once, and laughing and crying by turns, while"|FALSE
836|"father stood looking on and saying he was blessed or something."|FALSE
836|"'But how did you guess we'd come home,' said Cyril, later, when every"|FALSE
836|"one was calm enough for talking."|FALSE
836|"'Well, it was rather a rum thing. We heard the Garrick was on fire, and"|FALSE
836|"of course we went straight there,' said father, briskly. 'We couldn't"|FALSE
836|"find you, of course--and we couldn't get in--but the firemen told"|FALSE
836|"us every one was safely out. And then I heard a voice at my ear say,"|FALSE
836|"\"Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane\"--and something touched me on the"|FALSE
836|"shoulder. It was a great yellow pigeon, and it got in the way of my"|FALSE
836|"seeing who'd spoken. It fluttered off, and then some one said in the"|FALSE
836|"other ear, \"They're safe at home\"; and when I turned again, to see who"|FALSE
836|"it was speaking, hanged if there wasn't that confounded pigeon on my"|FALSE
836|"other shoulder. Dazed by the fire, I suppose. Your mother said it was"|FALSE
836|"the voice of--'"|FALSE
836|"'I said it was the bird that spoke,' said mother, 'and so it was. Or at"|FALSE
836|"least I thought so then. It wasn't a pigeon. It was an orange-coloured"|FALSE

836|"safe.'"|FALSE
836|"Mother began to cry again, and father said bed was a good place after"|FALSE

836|"It flew out."|FALSE
836|"That was why the papers said next day that the fire at the theatre had"|FALSE

836|"How the management accounted for this, and how many of the theatre"|FALSE
836|"officials still believe that they were mad on that night will never be"|FALSE
836|"known."|FALSE
836|"Next day mother saw the burnt holes in the carpet."|FALSE
836|"'It caught where it was paraffiny,' said Anthea."|FALSE
836|"'I must get rid of that carpet at once,' said mother."|FALSE

836|"'Egg, toast, tea, milk, tea-cup and saucer, egg-spoon, knife,"|FALSE
836|"butter--that's all, I think,' remarked Anthea, as she put the last"|FALSE
836|"touches to mother's breakfast-tray, and went, very carefully up the"|FALSE
836|"stairs, feeling for every step with her toes, and holding on to the tray"|FALSE
836|"with all her fingers. She crept into mother's room and set the tray on a"|FALSE
836|"chair. Then she pulled one of the blinds up very softly."|FALSE
836|"'Is your head better, mammy dear?' she asked, in the soft little voice"|FALSE
836|"that she kept expressly for mother's headaches. 'I've brought your"|FALSE
836|"brekkie, and I've put the little cloth with clover-leaves on it, the one"|FALSE
836|"I made you.'"|FALSE
836|"'That's very nice,' said mother sleepily."|FALSE
836|"Anthea knew exactly what to do for mothers with headaches who had"|FALSE
836|"breakfast in bed. She fetched warm water and put just enough eau de"|FALSE
836|"Cologne in it, and bathed mother's face and hands with the sweet-scented"|FALSE
836|"water. Then mother was able to think about breakfast."|FALSE
836|"'But what's the matter with my girl?' she asked, when her eyes got used"|FALSE
836|"to the light."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, I'm so sorry you're ill,' Anthea said. 'It's that horrible fire and"|FALSE
836|"you being so frightened. Father said so. And we all feel as if it was"|FALSE
836|"our faults. I can't explain, but--'"|FALSE
836|"'It wasn't your fault a bit, you darling goosie,' mother said. 'How"|FALSE
836|"could it be?'"|FALSE
836|"'That's just what I can't tell you,' said Anthea. 'I haven't got"|FALSE
836|"a futile brain like you and father, to think of ways of explaining"|FALSE
836|"everything.'"|FALSE
836|"Mother laughed."|FALSE
836|"'My futile brain--or did you mean fertile?--anyway, it feels very stiff"|FALSE
836|"and sore this morning--but I shall be quite all right by and by. And"|FALSE
836|"don't be a silly little pet girl. The fire wasn't your faults. No; I"|FALSE
836|"don't want the egg, dear. I'll go to sleep again, I think. Don't you"|FALSE
836|"worry. And tell cook not to bother me about meals. You can order what"|FALSE
836|"you like for lunch.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea closed the door very mousily, and instantly went downstairs and"|FALSE
836|"ordered what she liked for lunch. She ordered a pair of turkeys, a large"|FALSE
836|"plum-pudding, cheese-cakes, and almonds and raisins."|FALSE
836|"Cook told her to go along, do. And she might as well not have ordered"|FALSE

836|"When Anthea rejoined the others she found them all plunged in the gloom"|FALSE

836|"numbered its threads."|FALSE
836|"So that now, after nearly a month of magic happenings, the time was at"|FALSE

836|"be sorry we haven't got.'"|FALSE
836|"'Mother's going to send away the carpet as soon as she's well enough to"|FALSE
836|"see about that coconut matting. Fancy us with coconut-matting--us! And"|FALSE

836|"They were all talking about the carpet, but what they were all thinking"|FALSE

836|"The golden bird had been so kind, so friendly, so polite, so"|FALSE
836|"instructive--and now it had set fire to a theatre and made mother ill."|FALSE
836|"Nobody blamed the bird. It had acted in a perfectly natural manner. But"|FALSE
836|"every one saw that it must not be asked to prolong its visit. Indeed, in"|FALSE
836|"plain English it must be asked to go!"|FALSE
836|"The four children felt like base spies and treacherous friends; and each"|FALSE
836|"in its mind was saying who ought not to be the one to tell the Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"that there could no longer be a place for it in that happy home in"|FALSE
836|"Camden Town. Each child was quite sure that one of them ought to speak"|FALSE
836|"out in a fair and manly way, but nobody wanted to be the one."|FALSE
836|"They could not talk the whole thing over as they would have liked to do,"|FALSE
836|"because the Phoenix itself was in the cupboard, among the blackbeetles"|FALSE
836|"and the odd shoes and the broken chessmen."|FALSE
836|"But Anthea tried."|FALSE
836|"'It's very horrid. I do hate thinking things about people, and not being"|FALSE
836|"able to say the things you're thinking because of the way they would"|FALSE

836|"what they'd done to make you think things like that, and why you were"|FALSE
836|"thinking them.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea was so anxious that the Phoenix should not understand what she"|FALSE

836|"Cyril understood."|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' he said, while Jane and Robert were trying to tell each other how"|FALSE

836|"eventfulnesses a new leaf has to be turned over, and, after all,"|FALSE
836|"mother is more important than the feelings of any of the lower forms of"|FALSE
836|"creation, however unnatural.'"|FALSE
836|"'How beautifully you do do it,' said Anthea, absently beginning to build"|FALSE
836|"a card-house for the Lamb--'mixing up what you're saying, I mean. We"|FALSE
836|"ought to practise doing it so as to be ready for mysterious occasions."|FALSE
836|"We're talking about THAT,' she said to Jane and Robert, frowning, and"|FALSE
836|"nodding towards the cupboard where the Phoenix was. Then Robert and Jane"|FALSE
836|"understood, and each opened its mouth to speak."|FALSE
836|"'Wait a minute,' said Anthea quickly; 'the game is to twist up what you"|FALSE
836|"want to say so that no one can understand what you're saying except the"|FALSE
836|"people you want to understand it, and sometimes not them.'"|FALSE
836|"'The ancient philosophers,' said a golden voice, 'Well understood the"|FALSE
836|"art of which you speak.'"|FALSE
836|"Of course it was the Phoenix, who had not been in the cupboard at all,"|FALSE
836|"but had been cocking a golden eye at them from the cornice during the"|FALSE
836|"whole conversation."|FALSE
836|"'Pretty dickie!' remarked the Lamb. 'CANARY dickie!'"|FALSE
836|"'Poor misguided infant,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"There was a painful pause; the four could not but think it likely that"|FALSE
836|"the Phoenix had understood their very veiled allusions, accompanied as"|FALSE
836|"they had been by gestures indicating the cupboard. For the Phoenix was"|FALSE
836|"not wanting in intelligence."|FALSE
836|"'We were just saying--' Cyril began, and I hope he was not going to"|FALSE
836|"say anything but the truth. Whatever it was he did not say it, for the"|FALSE
836|"Phoenix interrupted him, and all breathed more freely as it spoke."|FALSE
836|"'I gather,' it said, 'that you have some tidings of a fatal nature to"|FALSE
836|"communicate to our degraded black brothers who run to and fro for ever"|FALSE
836|"yonder.' It pointed a claw at the cupboard, where the blackbeetles"|FALSE
836|"lived."|FALSE
836|"'Canary TALK,' said the Lamb joyously; 'go and show mammy.'"|FALSE
836|"He wriggled off Anthea's lap."|FALSE
836|"'Mammy's asleep,' said Jane, hastily. 'Come and be wild beasts in a cage"|FALSE
836|"under the table.'"|FALSE
836|"But the Lamb caught his feet and hands, and even his head, so often and"|FALSE
836|"so deeply in the holes of the carpet that the cage, or table, had to be"|FALSE
836|"moved on to the linoleum, and the carpet lay bare to sight with all its"|FALSE
836|"horrid holes."|FALSE
836|"'Ah,' said the bird, 'it isn't long for this world.'"|FALSE
836|"'No,' said Robert; 'everything comes to an end. It's awful.'"|FALSE
836|"'Sometimes the end is peace,' remarked the Phoenix. 'I imagine that"|FALSE
836|"unless it comes soon the end of your carpet will be pieces.'"|FALSE
836|"'Yes,' said Cyril, respectfully kicking what was left of the carpet. The"|FALSE
836|"movement of its bright colours caught the eye of the Lamb, who went down"|FALSE
836|"on all fours instantly and began to pull at the red and blue threads."|FALSE
836|"'Aggedydaggedygaggedy,' murmured the Lamb; 'daggedy ag ag ag!'"|FALSE
836|"And before any one could have winked (even if they had wanted to, and it"|FALSE
836|"would not have been of the slightest use) the middle of the floor showed"|FALSE
836|"bare, an island of boards surrounded by a sea of linoleum. The magic"|FALSE
836|"carpet was gone, AND SO WAS THE LAMB!"|FALSE
836|"There was a horrible silence. The Lamb--the baby, all alone--had been"|FALSE
836|"wafted away on that untrustworthy carpet, so full of holes and magic."|FALSE
836|"And no one could know where he was. And no one could follow him because"|FALSE
836|"there was now no carpet to follow on."|FALSE
836|"Jane burst into tears, but Anthea, though pale and frantic, was"|FALSE
836|"dry-eyed."|FALSE
836|"'It MUST be a dream,' she said."|FALSE
836|"'That's what the clergyman said,' remarked Robert forlornly; 'but it"|FALSE
836|"wasn't, and it isn't.'"|FALSE
836|"'But the Lamb never wished,' said Cyril; 'he was only talking Bosh.'"|FALSE
836|"'The carpet understands all speech,' said the Phoenix, 'even Bosh. I"|FALSE
836|"know not this Boshland, but be assured that its tongue is not unknown to"|FALSE
836|"the carpet.'"|FALSE
836|"'Do you mean, then,' said Anthea, in white terror, 'that when he was"|FALSE
836|"saying \"Agglety dag,\" or whatever it was, that he meant something by"|FALSE
836|"it?'"|FALSE
836|"'All speech has meaning,' said the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"'There I think you're wrong,' said Cyril; 'even people who talk English"|FALSE
836|"sometimes say things that don't mean anything in particular.'"|FALSE
836|"'Oh, never mind that now,' moaned Anthea; 'you think \"Aggety dag\" meant"|FALSE
836|"something to him and the carpet?'"|FALSE
836|"'Beyond doubt it held the same meaning to the carpet as to the luckless"|FALSE
836|"infant,' the Phoenix said calmly."|FALSE
836|"'And WHAT did it mean? Oh WHAT?'"|FALSE
836|"'Unfortunately,' the bird rejoined, 'I never studied Bosh.'"|FALSE
836|"Jane sobbed noisily, but the others were calm with what is sometimes"|FALSE
836|"called the calmness of despair. The Lamb was gone--the Lamb, their own"|FALSE
836|"precious baby brother--who had never in his happy little life been for a"|FALSE
836|"moment out of the sight of eyes that loved him--he was gone. He had gone"|FALSE
836|"alone into the great world with no other companion and protector than a"|FALSE
836|"carpet with holes in it. The children had never really understood"|FALSE
836|"before what an enormously big place the world is. And the Lamb might be"|FALSE
836|"anywhere in it!"|FALSE
836|"'And it's no use going to look for him.' Cyril, in flat and wretched"|FALSE
836|"tones, only said what the others were thinking."|FALSE
836|"'Do you wish him to return?' the Phoenix asked; it seemed to speak with"|FALSE
836|"some surprise."|FALSE
836|"'Of course we do!' cried everybody."|FALSE
836|"'Isn't he more trouble than he's worth?' asked the bird doubtfully."|FALSE
836|"'No, no. Oh, we do want him back! We do!'"|FALSE
836|"'Then,' said the wearer of gold plumage, 'if you'll excuse me, I'll just"|FALSE
836|"pop out and see what I can do.'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril flung open the window, and the Phoenix popped out."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, if only mother goes on sleeping! Oh, suppose she wakes up and wants"|FALSE
836|"the Lamb! Oh, suppose the servants come! Stop crying, Jane. It's no"|FALSE
836|"earthly good. No, I'm not crying myself--at least I wasn't till you said"|FALSE
836|"so, and I shouldn't anyway if--if there was any mortal thing we could"|FALSE
836|"do. Oh, oh, oh!'"|FALSE
836|"Cyril and Robert were boys, and boys never cry, of course. Still, the"|FALSE
836|"position was a terrible one, and I do not wonder that they made faces in"|FALSE
836|"their efforts to behave in a really manly way."|FALSE
836|"And at this awful moment mother's bell rang."|FALSE
836|"A breathless stillness held the children. Then Anthea dried her eyes."|FALSE
836|"She looked round her and caught up the poker. She held it out to Cyril."|FALSE
836|"'Hit my hand hard,' she said; 'I must show mother some reason for my"|FALSE
836|"eyes being like they are. Harder,' she cried as Cyril gently tapped her"|FALSE
836|"with the iron handle. And Cyril, agitated and trembling, nerved himself"|FALSE
836|"to hit harder, and hit very much harder than he intended."|FALSE
836|"Anthea screamed."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, Panther, I didn't mean to hurt, really,' cried Cyril, clattering"|FALSE
836|"the poker back into the fender."|FALSE
836|"'It's--all--right,' said Anthea breathlessly, clasping the hurt hand"|FALSE
836|"with the one that wasn't hurt; 'it's--getting--red.'"|FALSE
836|"It was--a round red and blue bump was rising on the back of it. 'Now,"|FALSE
836|"Robert,' she said, trying to breathe more evenly, 'you go out--oh, I"|FALSE
836|"don't know where--on to the dustbin--anywhere--and I shall tell mother"|FALSE
836|"you and the Lamb are out.'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea was now ready to deceive her mother for as long as ever she"|FALSE
836|"could. Deceit is very wrong, we know, but it seemed to Anthea that it"|FALSE
836|"was her plain duty to keep her mother from being frightened about the"|FALSE
836|"Lamb as long as possible. And the Phoenix might help."|FALSE
836|"'It always has helped,' Robert said; 'it got us out of the tower, and"|FALSE
836|"even when it made the fire in the theatre it got us out all right. I'm"|FALSE
836|"certain it will manage somehow.'"|FALSE
836|"Mother's bell rang again."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, Eliza's never answered it,' cried Anthea; 'she never does. Oh, I"|FALSE
836|"must go.'"|FALSE
836|"And she went."|FALSE
836|"Her heart beat bumpingly as she climbed the stairs. Mother would be"|FALSE
836|"certain to notice her eyes--well, her hand would account for that. But"|FALSE
836|"the Lamb--"|FALSE
836|"'No, I must NOT think of the Lamb, she said to herself, and bit her"|FALSE
836|"tongue till her eyes watered again, so as to give herself something"|FALSE
836|"else to think of. Her arms and legs and back, and even her tear-reddened"|FALSE
836|"face, felt stiff with her resolution not to let mother be worried if she"|FALSE
836|"could help it."|FALSE
836|"She opened the door softly."|FALSE
836|"'Yes, mother?' she said."|FALSE
836|"'Dearest,' said mother, 'the Lamb--'"|FALSE
836|"Anthea tried to be brave. She tried to say that the Lamb and Robert were"|FALSE
836|"out. Perhaps she tried too hard. Anyway, when she opened her mouth no"|FALSE
836|"words came. So she stood with it open. It seemed easier to keep from"|FALSE
836|"crying with one's mouth in that unusual position."|FALSE
836|"'The Lamb,' mother went on; 'he was very good at first, but he's pulled"|FALSE
836|"the toilet-cover off the dressing-table with all the brushes and"|FALSE
836|"pots and things, and now he's so quiet I'm sure he's in some dreadful"|FALSE

836|"'Of course he's here,' said mother, a little impatiently. 'Where did you"|FALSE

836|"Anthea went round the foot of the big mahogany bed. There was a pause."|FALSE
836|"'He's not here NOW,' she said."|FALSE
836|"That he had been there was plain, from the toilet-cover on the floor,"|FALSE

836|"by his brothers and by Jane, sat the Lamb. He had covered his face and"|FALSE
836|"clothes with vaseline and violet powder, but he was easily recognizable"|FALSE
836|"in spite of this disguise."|FALSE
836|"'You are right,' said the Phoenix, who was also present; 'it is evident"|FALSE

836|"you darling! Shut up, Jane! I don't care HOW much he comes off on"|FALSE

836|"I must leave you. I have sought to prepare you for this. Ah, do not give"|FALSE
836|"way!'"|FALSE
836|"'Must you really go--so soon?' murmured Anthea. It was what she had"|FALSE
836|"often heard her mother say to calling ladies in the afternoon."|FALSE
836|"'I must, really; thank you so much, dear,' replied the bird, just as"|FALSE

836|"'Any little thing we can do,' said Robert."|FALSE

836|"The children spread out what was left of the carpet. And, after all,"|FALSE
836|"though this was just what they would have wished to have happened, all"|FALSE

836|"went out, closing the door on the Phoenix--left, at last, alone with the"|FALSE
836|"carpet."|FALSE
836|"'One of us must keep watch,' said Robert, excitedly, as soon as they"|FALSE

836|"Don't let's stand to a threepence or so. I want it to have a jolly good"|FALSE

836|"'I'll keep watch if you like,' said Cyril. 'I don't mind. And, besides,"|FALSE

836|"So they left Cyril, standing like a Roman sentinel outside the door"|FALSE
836|"inside which the Phoenix was getting ready for the great change, and"|FALSE
836|"they all went out to buy the precious things for the last sad rites."|FALSE
836|"'Robert is right,' Anthea said; 'this is no time for being careful about"|FALSE
836|"our money. Let's go to the stationer's first, and buy a whole packet of"|FALSE
836|"lead-pencils. They're cheaper if you buy them by the packet.'"|FALSE
836|"This was a thing that they had always wanted to do, but it needed the"|FALSE
836|"great excitement of a funeral pyre and a parting from a beloved Phoenix"|FALSE
836|"to screw them up to the extravagance."|FALSE
836|"The people at the stationer's said that the pencils were real"|FALSE
836|"cedar-wood, so I hope they were, for stationers should always speak"|FALSE
836|"the truth. At any rate they cost one-and-fourpence. Also they spent"|FALSE
836|"sevenpence three-farthings on a little sandal-wood box inlaid with"|FALSE
836|"ivory."|FALSE
836|"'Because,' said Anthea, 'I know sandalwood smells sweet, and when it's"|FALSE
836|"burned it smells very sweet indeed.'"|FALSE
836|"'Ivory doesn't smell at all,' said Robert, 'but I expect when you burn"|FALSE
836|"it it smells most awful vile, like bones.'"|FALSE
836|"At the grocer's they bought all the spices they could remember the names"|FALSE
836|"of--shell-like mace, cloves like blunt nails, peppercorns, the long"|FALSE
836|"and the round kind; ginger, the dry sort, of course; and the beautiful"|FALSE
836|"bloom-covered shells of fragrant cinnamon. Allspice too, and caraway"|FALSE
836|"seeds (caraway seeds that smelt most deadly when the time came for"|FALSE
836|"burning them)."|FALSE
836|"Camphor and oil of lavender were bought at the chemist's, and also a"|FALSE
836|"little scent sachet labelled 'Violettes de Parme'."|FALSE
836|"They took the things home and found Cyril still on guard. When they had"|FALSE
836|"knocked and the golden voice of the Phoenix had said 'Come in,' they"|FALSE
836|"went in."|FALSE
836|"There lay the carpet--or what was left of it--and on it lay an egg,"|FALSE
836|"exactly like the one out of which the Phoenix had been hatched."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix was walking round and round the egg, clucking with joy and"|FALSE
836|"pride."|FALSE
836|"'I've laid it, you see,' it said, 'and as fine an egg as ever I laid in"|FALSE
836|"all my born days.'"|FALSE
836|"Every one said yes, it was indeed a beauty."|FALSE
836|"The things which the children had bought were now taken out of their"|FALSE
836|"papers and arranged on the table, and when the Phoenix had been"|FALSE
836|"persuaded to leave its egg for a moment and look at the materials for"|FALSE
836|"its last fire it was quite overcome."|FALSE
836|"'Never, never have I had a finer pyre than this will be. You shall not"|FALSE
836|"regret it,' it said, wiping away a golden tear. 'Write quickly: \"Go and"|FALSE
836|"tell the Psammead to fulfil the last wish of the Phoenix, and return"|FALSE
836|"instantly\".'"|FALSE
836|"But Robert wished to be polite and he wrote--"|FALSE
836|"'Please go and ask the Psammead to be so kind as to fulfil the Phoenix's"|FALSE
836|"last wish, and come straight back, if you please.' The paper was pinned"|FALSE
836|"to the carpet, which vanished and returned in the flash of an eye."|FALSE
836|"Then another paper was written ordering the carpet to take the egg"|FALSE
836|"somewhere where it wouldn't be hatched for another two thousand years."|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix tore itself away from its cherished egg, which it watched"|FALSE
836|"with yearning tenderness till, the paper being pinned on, the carpet"|FALSE
836|"hastily rolled itself up round the egg, and both vanished for ever from"|FALSE
836|"the nursery of the house in Camden Town."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!' said everybody."|FALSE
836|"'Bear up,' said the bird; 'do you think _I_ don't suffer, being parted"|FALSE
836|"from my precious new-laid egg like this? Come, conquer your emotions and"|FALSE
836|"build my fire.'"|FALSE
836|"'OH!' cried Robert, suddenly, and wholly breaking down, 'I can't BEAR"|FALSE
836|"you to go!'"|FALSE
836|"The Phoenix perched on his shoulder and rubbed its beak softly against"|FALSE
836|"his ear."|FALSE
836|"'The sorrows of youth soon appear but as dreams,' it said. 'Farewell,"|FALSE
836|"Robert of my heart. I have loved you well.'"|FALSE
836|"The fire had burnt to a red glow. One by one the spices and sweet woods"|FALSE
836|"were laid on it. Some smelt nice and some--the caraway seeds and the"|FALSE
836|"Violettes de Parme sachet among them--smelt worse than you would think"|FALSE
836|"possible."|FALSE
836|"'Farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell!' said the Phoenix, in a"|FALSE
836|"far-away voice."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, GOOD-BYE,' said every one, and now all were in tears."|FALSE
836|"The bright bird fluttered seven times round the room and settled in the"|FALSE
836|"hot heart of the fire. The sweet gums and spices and woods flared and"|FALSE
836|"flickered around it, but its golden feathers did not burn. It seemed to"|FALSE
836|"grow red-hot to the very inside heart of it--and then before the eight"|FALSE
836|"eyes of its friends it fell together, a heap of white ashes, and the"|FALSE
836|"flames of the cedar pencils and the sandal-wood box met and joined above"|FALSE
836|"it."|FALSE
836|"'Whatever have you done with the carpet?' asked mother next day."|FALSE
836|"'We gave it to some one who wanted it very much. The name began with a"|FALSE
836|"P,' said Jane."|FALSE
836|"The others instantly hushed her."|FALSE
836|"'Oh, well, it wasn't worth twopence,' said mother."|FALSE
836|"'The person who began with P said we shouldn't lose by it,' Jane went on"|FALSE
836|"before she could be stopped."|FALSE
836|"'I daresay!' said mother, laughing."|FALSE
836|"But that very night a great box came, addressed to the children by all"|FALSE
836|"their names. Eliza never could remember the name of the carrier who"|FALSE
836|"brought it. It wasn't Carter Paterson or the Parcels Delivery."|FALSE
836|"It was instantly opened. It was a big wooden box, and it had to"|FALSE
836|"be opened with a hammer and the kitchen poker; the long nails came"|FALSE
836|"squeaking out, and boards scrunched as they were wrenched off. Inside"|FALSE
836|"the box was soft paper, with beautiful Chinese patterns on it--blue and"|FALSE
836|"green and red and violet. And under the paper--well, almost everything"|FALSE
836|"lovely that you can think of. Everything of reasonable size, I mean;"|FALSE
836|"for, of course, there were no motors or flying machines or thoroughbred"|FALSE
836|"chargers. But there really was almost everything else. Everything that"|FALSE
836|"the children had always wanted--toys and games and books, and chocolate"|FALSE
836|"and candied cherries and paint-boxes and photographic cameras, and all"|FALSE
836|"the presents they had always wanted to give to father and mother and the"|FALSE
836|"Lamb, only they had never had the money for them. At the very bottom"|FALSE
836|"of the box was a tiny golden feather. No one saw it but Robert, and he"|FALSE
836|"picked it up and hid it in the breast of his jacket, which had been"|FALSE
836|"so often the nesting-place of the golden bird. When he went to bed the"|FALSE
836|"feather was gone. It was the last he ever saw of the Phoenix."|FALSE
836|"Pinned to the lovely fur cloak that mother had always wanted was a"|FALSE
836|"paper, and it said--"|FALSE
836|"'In return for the carpet. With gratitude.--P.'"|FALSE
836|"You may guess how father and mother talked it over. They decided at"|FALSE
836|"last the person who had had the carpet, and whom, curiously enough, the"|FALSE
836|"children were quite unable to describe, must be an insane millionaire"|FALSE
836|"who amused himself by playing at being a rag-and-bone man. But the"|FALSE
836|"children knew better."|FALSE
836|"They knew that this was the fulfilment, by the powerful Psammead, of the"|FALSE
