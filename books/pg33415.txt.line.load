33415|"GESCHWITZ. I beg of you, don't speak!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Hold my tongue, with a head as full of thoughts as mine"|FALSE
33415|"is!--I absolutely can't believe she's changed so awfully much to her"|FALSE
33415|"advantage there!"|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. She is more glorious to look at than I have ever seen her!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. God preserve me from founding my life-happiness on your"|FALSE
33415|"taste and judgment! If the sickness has hit her as it has you, I'm"|FALSE
33415|"smashed and thru! You're leaving the contagious ward like an"|FALSE
33415|"acrobat-lady who's had an accident after giving herself up to art."|FALSE
33415|"You can scarcely blow your nose any more. First you need a"|FALSE
33415|"quarter-hour to sort your fingers, and then you have to be mighty"|FALSE
33415|"careful not to break off the tip."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. What puts *us* under the ground gives *her* health and"|FALSE
33415|"strength again."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. That's all right and fine enough. But I don't think I'll be"|FALSE
33415|"travelling off with her this evening."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. You will let your bride journey all alone, after all?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. In the first place, the old fellow's going with her to"|FALSE
33415|"protect her in case anything serious--. My escort could only be"|FALSE
33415|"suspicious. And secondly, I must wait here till my costumes are"|FALSE
33415|"ready. I'll get across the frontier soon enough alright,--and I hope"|FALSE
33415|"in the meantime she'll put on a little embonpoint, too. Then we'll"|FALSE
33415|"get married, provided I can present her before a respectable public."|FALSE
33415|"I love the practical in a woman: what theories they make up for"|FALSE
33415|"themselves are all the same to me. Aren't they to you too, doctor?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. I haven't heard what you were saying."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I'd never have got my person mixed up in this plot if she"|FALSE
33415|"hadn't kept tickling my bare pate, before her sentence. If only she"|FALSE
33415|"doesn't start doing too much as soon as she's out of Germany! I'd"|FALSE
33415|"like best to take her to London for six months, and let her fill up"|FALSE
33415|"on plum-cakes. In London one expands just from the sea air. And then,"|FALSE
33415|"too, in London one doesn't feel with every swallow of beer as if the"|FALSE
33415|"hand of fate were at one's throat."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. I've been asking myself for a week whether a person who'd been"|FALSE
33415|"sentenced to prison could still be made to go as the chief figure in"|FALSE
33415|"a modern drama."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. If the man would only come, now!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I've still got to redeem my properties out of the pawn-shop"|FALSE
33415|"here, too. Six hundred kilos of the best iron. The baggage-rate on"|FALSE
33415|"'em is always three times as much as my own ticket, so that the whole"|FALSE
33415|"junket isn't worth a trowser's button. When I went into the pawn-shop"|FALSE
33415|"with 'em, dripping with sweat, they asked me if the things were"|FALSE
33415|"genuine!--I'd have really done better to have had the costumes made"|FALSE
33415|"abroad. In Paris, for instance, they see at the first glance where"|FALSE
33415|"one's best points are, and bravely lay them bare. But you can't learn"|FALSE
33415|"that with bow-legs; it's got to be studied on classically shaped"|FALSE
33415|"people. In this country they're as scared of naked skin as they are"|FALSE
33415|"abroad of dynamite bombs. A couple of years ago I was fined fifty"|FALSE
33415|"marks at the Alhambra Theater, because people could see I had a few"|FALSE
33415|"hairs on my chest, not enough to make a respectable tooth-brush! But"|FALSE
33415|"the Fine Arts Minister opined that the little school-girls might lose"|FALSE
33415|"their joy in knitting stockings because of it; and since then I have"|FALSE
33415|"myself shaved once a month."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. If I didn't need every bit of my creative power now for the"|FALSE
33415|"\"World-conqueror,\" I might like to test the problem and see what"|FALSE
33415|"could be done with it. That's the curse of our young literature:"|FALSE
33415|"we're so much too literary. We know only such questions and problems"|FALSE
33415|"as come up among writers and cultured people. We cannot see beyond"|FALSE
33415|"the limits of our own professional interests. In order to get back on"|FALSE
33415|"the trail of a great and powerful art we must move as much as"|FALSE
33415|"possible among men who've never read a book in their lives, whom the"|FALSE
33415|"simplest animal instincts direct in all they do. I've tried already,"|FALSE
33415|"with all my might, to work according to those principles--in my"|FALSE
33415|"\"Earth-spirit.\" The woman who was my model for the chief figure in"|FALSE
33415|"that, breathes to-day--and has for a year--behind barred windows; and"|FALSE
33415|"on that account for some incomprehensible reason the play was only"|FALSE
33415|"brought to performance by the Society for Free Literature. As long as"|FALSE
33415|"my father was alive, all the stages of Germany stood open to my"|FALSE
33415|"creations. That has been vastly changed."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I've had a pair of tights made of the tenderest blue-green."|FALSE
33415|"If *they* don't make a success abroad, I'll sell mouse-traps! The"|FALSE
33415|"trunks are so delicate I can't sit on the edge of a table in 'em. The"|FALSE
33415|"only thing that will disturb the good impression is my awful bald"|FALSE
33415|"head, which I owe to my active participation in this great"|FALSE
33415|"conspiracy. To lie in the hospital in perfect health for three months"|FALSE
33415|"would make a fat pig of the most run-down old hobo. Since coming out"|FALSE
33415|"I've fed on nothing but Karlsbad pills. Day and night I have"|FALSE
33415|"orchestra rehearsals in my intestines. I'll be so washed out before I"|FALSE
33415|"get across the frontier that I won't be able to lift a bottle-cork."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. How the attendants in the hospital got out of her way"|FALSE
33415|"yesterday! That was a refreshing sight. The garden was still as the"|FALSE
33415|"grave: in the loveliest noon sunlight the convalescents didn't"|FALSE
33415|"venture out of doors. Away back by the contagious ward she stepped"|FALSE
33415|"out under the mulberry trees and swayed on her ankles on the gravel."|FALSE
33415|"The door-keeper had recognized me, and a young doctor who met me in"|FALSE
33415|"the corridor shrunk up as tho a revolver shot had struck him. The"|FALSE
33415|"Sisters vanished into the big rooms or stayed stuck against the"|FALSE
33415|"walls. When I came back there was not a soul to be seen in the garden"|FALSE
33415|"or at the gate. No better chance could have been found, if we had had"|FALSE
33415|"the curséd passports. And now the fellow says he isn't going with"|FALSE
33415|"her!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I understand the poor hospital-brothers. One has a bad foot"|FALSE
33415|"and another has a swollen cheek, and there appears in the midst of"|FALSE
33415|"them the incarnate death-insurance-agentess! In the Hall of the"|FALSE
33415|"Knights, as the blessed division was called from which I organized my"|FALSE
33415|"spying, when the news got around there that Sister Theophila had"|FALSE
33415|"departed this life, not one of the fellows could be kept in bed. They"|FALSE
33415|"scrambled up to the window-bars, if they had to drag their pains"|FALSE
33415|"along with them by the hundred-weight. I never heard such swearing in"|FALSE
33415|"my life!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Allow me, Fräulein von Geschwitz, to come back to my"|FALSE
33415|"proposition once more. Tho my father was shot in this room, still I"|FALSE
33415|"can see in the murder, as in the punishment, nothing but a horrible"|FALSE
33415|"misfortune that has befallen *her*; nor do I think that my father, if"|FALSE
33415|"he had come through alive, would have withdrawn his support from her"|FALSE
33415|"entirely. Whether your plan for freeing her will succeed still seems"|FALSE
33415|"to me very doubtful, tho I wouldn't like to discourage you; but I can"|FALSE
33415|"find no words to express the admiration with which your"|FALSE
33415|"self-sacrifice, your energy, your superhuman scorn of death, inspires"|FALSE
33415|"me. I don't believe any man ever risked so much for a woman, let"|FALSE
33415|"alone for a friend. I am not aware, Fräulein von Geschwitz, how rich"|FALSE
33415|"you are, but the expenses for what you have accomplished must have"|FALSE
33415|"exhausted your fortune. May I venture to offer you a loan of 20,000"|FALSE
33415|"marks--which I should have no trouble raising for you in cash?"|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. How we did rejoice when Sister Theophila was really dead!"|FALSE
33415|"From that day on we were free from custody. We changed our beds as we"|FALSE
33415|"liked. I had done my hair like hers, and copied every tone of her"|FALSE
33415|"voice. When the professor came he called *her* \"gnädiges Fräulein\""|FALSE
33415|"and said to me, \"It's better living here than in prison!\"... When the"|FALSE
33415|"Sister suddenly was missing, we looked at each other in suspense: we"|FALSE
33415|"had both been sick five days: now was the deciding moment. Next"|FALSE
33415|"morning came the assistant.--\"How is Sister Theophila?\"--\"Dead!\"--We"|FALSE
33415|"communicated behind his back, and when he had gone we sank in each"|FALSE
33415|"other's arms: \"God be thanked! God be thanked!\"--What pains it cost"|FALSE
33415|"me to keep my darling from betraying how well she already was! \"You"|FALSE
33415|"have nine years of prison before you,\" I cried to her early and late."|FALSE
33415|"Now they probably won't let her stay in the contagious ward three"|FALSE
33415|"days more!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I lay in the hospital full three months to spy out the"|FALSE
33415|"ground, after toilfully peddling together the qualities necessary for"|FALSE
33415|"such a long stay. Now I act the valet here with you, Dr. Schön, so"|FALSE
33415|"that no strange servants may come into the house. Where is the"|FALSE
33415|"bridegroom who's ever done so much for his bride? *My* fortune has"|FALSE
33415|"also been destroyed."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. When you succeed in developing her into a respectable artiste"|FALSE
33415|"you will have put the world in debt to you. With the temperament and"|FALSE
33415|"the beauty that she has to give out of the depths of her nature she"|FALSE
33415|"can make the most blasé public hold its breath. And then, too, she"|FALSE
33415|"will be protected by *acting* passion from a second time becoming a"|FALSE
33415|"criminal in reality."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I'll soon drive her kiddishness out of her!"|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. There he comes! (_Steps louden in the gallery. Then the"|FALSE
33415|"curtains part at the head of the stairs and Schigolch in a long black"|FALSE
33415|"coat with a white sun-shade in his right hand comes down. Thruout the"|FALSE
33415|"play his speech is interrupted with frequent yawns._)"|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. Confound the darkness! Out-doors the sun burns your eyes"|FALSE
33415|"out."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. (_Wearily unwrapping herself._) I'm coming!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Her ladyship has seen no daylight for three days. We live"|FALSE
33415|"here like in a snuff-box."|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. Since nine o'clock this morning I've been round to all the"|FALSE
33415|"old-clothes-men. Three brand new trunks stuffed full of old trowsers"|FALSE
33415|"I've expressed to Buenos Ayres via Bremerhaven. My legs are dangling"|FALSE
33415|"on me like the tongue of a bell. That's the new life it's going to be"|FALSE
33415|"from now on!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Where are you going to get off to-morrow morning?"|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. I hope not straight into Ox-butter Hotel again!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I can tell you a fine hotel. I lived there with a lady"|FALSE
33415|"lion-tamer. The people were born in Berlin."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. (_Upright in the arm-chair._) Come and help me!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. (_Hurries to her and supports her._) And you'll be safer"|FALSE
33415|"from the police there than on a high tightrope!"|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. He means to let you go with her alone this afternoon."|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. Maybe he's still suffering from his chillblains!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Do you want me to start my new engagement in bath-robe and"|FALSE
33415|"slippers?"|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. Hm--Sister Theophila wouldn't have gone to heaven so"|FALSE
33415|"promptly either, if she hadn't felt so affectionate towards our"|FALSE
33415|"patient."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO.. She'll have a different value when one must serve thru a"|FALSE
33415|"honeymoon with her. Anyway, it can't hurt her if she gets a little"|FALSE
33415|"fresh air beforehand."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. (_A pocketbook in his hand, to Geschwitz who is leaning on a"|FALSE
33415|"chair-back by the centre table._) This holds 10,000 marks."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. Thank you, no."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Please take it."|FALSE
33415|"GESCHWITZ. (_To Schigolch._) Come along, at last!"|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. Patience, Fräulein. It's only a stone's throw across"|FALSE
33415|"Hospital Street. I'll be here with her in five minutes."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. You're bringing her here?"|FALSE
33415|"SCHIGOLCH. I'm bringing her here. Or do you fear for your health?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. You see that I fear nothing."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. According to the latest wire, the doctor is on his way to"|FALSE
33415|"Constantinople to have his \"Earth-spirit\" produced before the Sultan"|FALSE
33415|"by harem-ladies and eunuchs."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. (_Opening the centre door under the gallery._) It's shorter for"|FALSE
33415|"you thru here. (_Exeunt Schigolch and Countess Geschwitz. Alva locks"|FALSE
33415|"the door._)"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. You were going to give more money to the crazy sky-rocket!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. What has that to do with you?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I get paid like a lamp-lighter, tho I had to demoralize all"|FALSE
33415|"the Sisters in the hospital. Then came the assistants' and the"|FALSE
33415|"doctors' turn, and then--"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Will you seriously inform me that the medical professors let"|FALSE
33415|"themselves be influenced by you?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. With the money those gentlemen cost me I could become"|FALSE
33415|"President of the United States!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. But Fräulein von Geschwitz has reimbursed you for every penny"|FALSE
33415|"that you spent. So far as I know you're getting a monthly salary of"|FALSE
33415|"five hundred marks from her besides. It is often pretty hard to"|FALSE
33415|"believe in your love for the unhappy murderess. When I asked Fräulein"|FALSE
33415|"von Geschwitz just now to accept my help, it certainly was not to"|FALSE
33415|"incite your insatiable avarice. The admiration which I have learnt to"|FALSE
33415|"have for Fräulein von Geschwitz in this affair, I am far from feeling"|FALSE
33415|"towards you. It is not at all clear to me what claims of any kind you"|FALSE
33415|"can make upon me. That you chanced to be present at the murder of my"|FALSE
33415|"father has not yet created the slightest bond of relationship between"|FALSE
33415|"you and me. On the contrary, I am firmly convinced that if the heroic"|FALSE
33415|"undertaking of Countess Geschwitz had not come your way you would be"|FALSE
33415|"lying somewhere to-day without a penny, drunken in the gutter."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. And do you know what would have become of you if you hadn't"|FALSE
33415|"sold for two millions the tuppeny paper your father ran? You'd have"|FALSE
33415|"hitched up with the stringiest sort of ballet-girl and been to-day a"|FALSE
33415|"stable-boy in the Humpelmeier Circus. What work do you do? You've"|FALSE
33415|"written a drama of horrors in which my bride's calves are the two"|FALSE
33415|"chief figures and which no high-class theater will produce. You"|FALSE
33415|"walking pajamas! You fresh rag-bag you! Two years ago I balanced two"|FALSE
33415|"saddled cavalry-horses on this chest. How that'll go now, after this"|FALSE
33415|"(_clasping his bald head_), is a question sure enough. The foreign"|FALSE
33415|"girls will get a fine idea of German art when they see the sweat come"|FALSE
33415|"beading thru my tights at every fresh kilo-weight! I shall make the"|FALSE
33415|"whole auditorium stink with my exhalations!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. You're weak as a dish-clout!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Would to God you were right! or did you perhaps intend to"|FALSE
33415|"insult me? If so, I'll set the tip of my toe to your jaw so that your"|FALSE
33415|"tongue'll crawl along the carpet over there!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Try it! (_Steps and voices outside._) Who is that...?"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. You can thank God that I have no public here before me!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Who can that be!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. That is my beloved. It's a full year now since we've seen"|FALSE
33415|"each other."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. But how should they be back already! Who can be coming there? I"|FALSE
33415|"expect no one."|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. Oh the devil, unlock it!"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Hide yourself!"|FALSE
33415|"RODRIGO. I'll get behind the portières. I've stood there once before,"|FALSE
33415|"a year ago. (_Disappears, right. Alva opens the rear door, whereupon"|FALSE
33415|"Alfred Hugenberg enters, hat in hand._)"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. With whom have I--.... You? Aren't you--?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Alfred Hugenberg."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. What can I do for you?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I've come from Münsterburg. I ran away this morning."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. My eyes are bad. I am forced to keep the blinds closed."|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I need your help. You will not refuse me. I've got a plan"|FALSE
33415|"ready. Can anyone hear us?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. What do you mean? What sort of a plan?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. Are you alone?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Yes. What do you want to impart to me?"|FALSE
33415|"HUGENBERG. I've had two plans already that I let drop. What I shall"|FALSE
33415|"tell you now has been worked out to the last possible chance. If I"|FALSE
33415|"had money I should not confide it to you; I thought about that a long"|FALSE
33415|"time before coming.... Will you not permit me to set forth to you my"|FALSE

33415|"took a course in hospital nursing here, and when she had the"|FALSE
33415|"necessary documents she journeyed to Hamburg with them and nursed the"|FALSE
33415|"cholera patients. At the first opportunity that offered she put on"|FALSE
33415|"the underclothes in which a sick woman had just died and which really"|FALSE

33415|"came to see me in prison. In my cell, while the wardress was outside,"|FALSE
33415|"we, as quick as we could, exchanged underclothes."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. So that was the reason why the Countess and you fell sick of"|FALSE

33415|"lay in one room in the contagious ward behind the hospital, and from"|FALSE
33415|"the first day Geschwitz put forth all her art to make our two faces"|FALSE
33415|"as like each other as possible. Day before yesterday she was let out"|FALSE
33415|"as cured. Just now she came back and said she'd forgotten her watch."|FALSE
33415|"I put on her clothes, she slipped into my prison frock, and then I"|FALSE
33415|"came away. (_With pleasure._) Now she's lying over there as the"|FALSE
33415|"murderess of Dr. Schön."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. So far as outward appearance goes you can still agree with the"|FALSE
33415|"picture as much as ever."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. I'm a little peaked in the face, but otherwise I've lost"|FALSE
33415|"nothing. Only one gets incredibly nervous in prison."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. You looked horribly sick when you came in."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. I had to, to get our necks out of the noose.--And you? What"|FALSE
33415|"have you done in this year and a half?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. I've had a succès d'estime in literary circles with a play I"|FALSE

33415|"LULU. Who's your sweetheart now?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. An actress I've rented a house for in Karl Street."|FALSE

33415|"LULU. Can you stand that?"|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. You will never understand that. With me there's the closest"|FALSE
33415|"alternation between my sensuality and mental creativeness. So towards"|FALSE
33415|"you, for example, I have only the choice of regarding you"|FALSE
33415|"artistically or of loving you."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. (_In a fairy-story tone._) I used to dream every other night"|FALSE

33415|"the favor of this moment."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. I don't feel at all like that to-day.--Do you remember the"|FALSE
33415|"costume ball where I was dressed like a knight's squire? How those"|FALSE
33415|"wine-full women ran after me that time? Geschwitz crawled round,"|FALSE
33415|"round my feet, and begged me to step on her face with my cloth shoes."|FALSE
33415|"ALVA. Come, dear heart!"|FALSE
33415|"LULU. (_In the tone with which one quiets a restless child._)"|FALSE
33415|"Quietly! I shot your father."|FALSE

33415|"her childhood's dreams imagined the life even more intoxicating than"|FALSE
33415|"it is, and complained of it to Mama. On that, they nabbed me; but by"|FALSE
33415|"reliable demeanor I soon enough won the confidence of the criminal"|FALSE
33415|"police and they sent me here on a hundred and fifty marks a month,"|FALSE

33415|"again; and of the numberless adventuresses of the best families of"|FALSE
33415|"the entire world, whom chance brings together here, I have already"|FALSE

33415|"LULU. (_Decisively._) I wouldn't do in that business."|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. Your views on that question make no difference whatever"|FALSE

33415|"happiness, not plunge them into misfortune."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. (_As before._) The life in such a house can never make a woman"|FALSE
33415|"of my stamp happy. When I was fifteen, that might have happened to"|FALSE
33415|"me. I was desperate then--thought I should never be happy. I bought a"|FALSE
33415|"revolver, and ran one night bare-foot thru the deep snow over the"|FALSE
33415|"bridge to the park to shoot myself there. But then by good luck I lay"|FALSE
33415|"three months in the hospital without setting eyes on a man, and in"|FALSE
33415|"that time my eyes opened and I got to know myself. Night after night"|FALSE
33415|"in my dreams I saw the man for whom I was created and who was created"|FALSE
33415|"for me, and then when I was let out on the men again I was no longer"|FALSE
33415|"a silly goose. Since then I can see on a man, in a pitch-dark night"|FALSE
33415|"and a hundred feet away, whether we're suited to each other; and if I"|FALSE

33415|"you imagine I'll give myself to every and any Tom and Harry!"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. Toms and Harries don't patronize Oikonomopulos of Cairo."|FALSE
33415|"His custom consists of Scottish lords, Russian dignitaries, Indian"|FALSE
33415|"governors, and our jolly Rhineland captains of industry. I must only"|FALSE
33415|"guarantee that you speak French. With your gift for languages you'll"|FALSE
33415|"quickly enough learn as much English, besides, as you'll need to get"|FALSE
33415|"on with. And you'll reside in a royally furnished apartment with an"|FALSE
33415|"outlook on the minarets of the El Azhar Mosque, and walk around all"|FALSE
33415|"day on Persian carpets as thick as your fist, and dress every evening"|FALSE
33415|"in a fabulous Paris gown and drink as much champagne as your"|FALSE
33415|"customers can pay for, and, finally, you'll even remain, up to a"|FALSE
33415|"certain point, your own mistress. If the man doesn't please you, you"|FALSE
33415|"needn't bring him any reciprocal feelings. Just let him give in his"|FALSE
33415|"card, and then--(_Shrugs, and snaps his fingers._) If the ladies"|FALSE
33415|"didn't get used to that the whole business would be simply"|FALSE
33415|"impossible, because every one after the first four weeks would go"|FALSE
33415|"headlong to the devil."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. (_Her voice shaking._) I do believe that since yesterday you've"|FALSE
33415|"got a screw loose somewhere. Am I to understand that the Egyptian"|FALSE
33415|"will pay fifteen hundred francs for a person whom he's never seen?"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. I took the liberty of sending him your pictures."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. Those pictures that I gave you, you've sent to him?"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. You see he can value them better than I. The picture in"|FALSE
33415|"which you stand before the mirror as Eve he'll probably hang up at"|FALSE
33415|"the house-door, after you've got there.... And then there's one thing"|FALSE
33415|"more for you to notice: with Oikonomopulos in Cairo you'll be safer"|FALSE
33415|"from your blood-hounds than if you crept into a Canadian wilderness."|FALSE
33415|"It isn't so easy to transport an Egyptian courtesan to a German"|FALSE
33415|"prison,--first, on account of the mere expense, and second, from fear"|FALSE
33415|"of coming too close to eternal Justice."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. (_Proudly, in a clear voice._) What's your eternal Justice to"|FALSE
33415|"do with me! You can see as plain as your five fingers I shan't let"|FALSE
33415|"myself be locked up in any such amusement-place!"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. Then do you want me to whistle for the policeman?"|FALSE
33415|"LULU. (_In wonder._) Why don't you simply ask me for twelve hundred"|FALSE
33415|"marks, if you want the money?"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. I want for no money! And I also don't ask for it because"|FALSE
33415|"you're dead broke."|FALSE
33415|"LULU. We still have thirty thousand marks."|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. In Jungfrau-stock! I never have anything to do with"|FALSE
33415|"stock. The Attorney-General pays in the national currency, and"|FALSE
33415|"Oikonomopulos pays in English gold. You can be on board early"|FALSE
33415|"to-morrow. The passage doesn't last much more than five days. In two"|FALSE
33415|"weeks at most you're in safety. Here you are nearer to prison than"|FALSE
33415|"anywhere. It's a wonder which I, as one of the secret police, cannot"|FALSE
33415|"understand, that you two have been able to live for a full year"|FALSE
33415|"unmolested. But just as I came on the track of your antecedents, so"|FALSE
33415|"any day, with your mighty consumption of men, one of my colleagues"|FALSE
33415|"may make the happy discovery. Then I may just wipe my mouth, and you"|FALSE
33415|"spend in prison the most enjoyable years of your life. If you will"|FALSE
33415|"kindly decide quickly. The train goes at 12.30. If we haven't struck"|FALSE
33415|"a bargain before eleven, I whistle up the policeman. If we have, I"|FALSE
33415|"pack you, just as you stand, into a carriage, drive you to the"|FALSE
33415|"station, and to-morrow escort you on board ship."|FALSE

33415|"CASTI-PIANI. Don't you understand that I can act now only for your"|FALSE
33415|"bodily rescue?"|FALSE
33415|"LULU. I'll go with you to America or to China, but I can't let myself"|FALSE
33415|"be sold of my own accord! That is worse than prison!"|FALSE
33415|"CASTI-PIANI. (_Drawing a letter from his pocket._) Just read this"|FALSE
33415|"effusion! I'll read it to you. Here's the postmark \"Cairo,\" so you"|FALSE

33415|"absolutely no more honorable than the very best judge would tax it"|FALSE
33415|"with being, but a cry of joy like this lets me feel a certain moral"|FALSE
