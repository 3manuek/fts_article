39064|"PREFACE."|FALSE
39064|"I here offer a translation of the third or last part of Hegel’s"|FALSE
39064|"encyclopaedic sketch of philosophy,—the _Philosophy of Mind_. The volume,"|FALSE
39064|"like its subject, stands complete in itself. But it may also be regarded"|FALSE
39064|"as a supplement or continuation of the work begun in my version of his"|FALSE
39064|"_Logic_. I have not ventured upon the _Philosophy of Nature_ which lies"|FALSE
39064|"between these two. That is a province, to penetrate into which would"|FALSE
39064|"require an equipment of learning I make no claim to,—a province, also, of"|FALSE
39064|"which the present-day interest would be largely historical, or at least"|FALSE
39064|"bound up with historical circumstances."|FALSE
39064|"The translation is made from the German text given in the Second Part of"|FALSE
39064|"the Seventh Volume of Hegel’s Collected Works, occasionally corrected by"|FALSE
39064|"comparison with that found in the second and third editions (of 1827 and"|FALSE
39064|"1830) published by the author. I have reproduced only Hegel’s own"|FALSE
39064|"paragraphs, and entirely omitted the _Zusätze_ of the editors. These"|FALSE
39064|"addenda—which are in origin lecture-notes—to the paragraphs are, in the"|FALSE
39064|"text of the Collected Works, given for the first section only. The"|FALSE
39064|"psychological part which they accompany has been barely treated elsewhere"|FALSE
39064|"by Hegel: but a good popular exposition of it will be found in Erdmann’s"|FALSE
39064|"_Psychologische Briefe_. The second section was dealt with at greater"|FALSE
39064|"length by Hegel himself in his _Philosophy of Law_ (1820). The topics of"|FALSE
39064|"the third section are largely covered by his lectures on Art, Religion,"|FALSE
39064|"and History of Philosophy."|FALSE
39064|"I do not conceal from myself that the text offers a hard nut to crack. Yet"|FALSE
39064|"here and there, even through the medium of the translation, I think some"|FALSE
39064|"light cannot fail to come to an earnest student. Occasionally, too, as,"|FALSE
39064|"for instance, in §§ 406, 459, 549, and still more in §§ 552, 573, at the"|FALSE
39064|"close of which might stand the words _Liberavi animam meam_, the writer"|FALSE
39064|"really “lets himself go,” and gives his mind freely on questions where"|FALSE
39064|"speculation comes closely in touch with life."|FALSE
39064|"In the _Five Introductory Essays_ I have tried sometimes to put together,"|FALSE
39064|"and sometimes to provide with collateral elucidation, some points in the"|FALSE
39064|"Mental Philosophy. I shall not attempt to justify the selection of"|FALSE
39064|"subjects for special treatment further than to hope that they form a more"|FALSE
39064|"or less connected group, and to refer for a study of some general"|FALSE
39064|"questions of system and method to my _Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel’s"|FALSE

39064|"FIVE INTRODUCTORY ESSAYS IN PSYCHOLOGY AND ETHICS."|FALSE
39064|"Essay I. On The Scope Of A Philosophy Of Mind."|FALSE
39064|"The art of finding titles, and of striking out headings which catch the"|FALSE
39064|"eye or ear, and lead the mind by easy paths of association to the subject"|FALSE
39064|"under exposition, was not one of Hegel’s gifts. A stirring phrase, a vivid"|FALSE
39064|"or picturesque turn of words, he often has. But his lists of contents,"|FALSE
39064|"when they cease to be commonplace, are apt to run into the bizarre and the"|FALSE
39064|"grotesque. Generally, indeed, his rubrics are the old and (as we may be"|FALSE
39064|"tempted to call them) insignificant terms of the text-books. But, in"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel’s use of them, these conventional designations are charged with a"|FALSE
39064|"highly individualised meaning. They may mean more—they may mean less—than"|FALSE
39064|"they habitually pass for: but they unquestionably specify their meaning"|FALSE
39064|"with a unique and almost personal flavour. And this can hardly fail to"|FALSE
39064|"create and to disappoint undue expectations."|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Philosophy and its Parts."|FALSE
39064|"Even the main divisions of his system show this conservatism in"|FALSE
39064|"terminology. The names of the three parts of the Encyclopaedia are, we may"|FALSE
39064|"say, non-significant of their peculiar contents. And that for a good"|FALSE
39064|"reason. What Hegel proposes to give is no novel or special doctrine, but"|FALSE
39064|"the universal philosophy which has passed on from age to age, here"|FALSE
39064|"narrowed and there widened, but still essentially the same. It is"|FALSE
39064|"conscious of its continuity and proud of its identity with the teachings"|FALSE
39064|"of Plato and Aristotle."|FALSE
39064|"The earliest attempts of the Greek philosophers to present philosophy in a"|FALSE
39064|"complete and articulated order—attempts generally attributed to the"|FALSE
39064|"Stoics, the schoolmen of antiquity—made it a tripartite whole. These three"|FALSE
39064|"parts were Logic, Physics, and Ethics. In their entirety they were meant"|FALSE
39064|"to form a cycle of unified knowledge, satisfying the needs of theory as"|FALSE
39064|"well as practice. As time went on, however, the situation changed: and if"|FALSE
39064|"the old names remained, their scope and value suffered many changes. New"|FALSE
39064|"interests and curiosities, due to altered circumstances, brought other"|FALSE
39064|"departments of reality under the focus of investigation besides those"|FALSE
39064|"which had been primarily discussed under the old names. Inquiries became"|FALSE
39064|"more specialised, and each tended to segregate itself from the rest as an"|FALSE
39064|"independent field of science. The result was that in modern times the"|FALSE
39064|"territory still marked by the ancient titles had shrunk to a mere phantom"|FALSE
39064|"of its former bulk. Almost indeed things had come to such a pass that the"|FALSE
39064|"time-honoured figures had sunk into the misery of _rois fainéants_; while"|FALSE
39064|"the real business of knowledge was discharged by the younger and less"|FALSE
39064|"conventional lines of research which the needs and fashions of the time"|FALSE
39064|"had called up. Thus Logic, in the narrow formal sense, was turned into an"|FALSE
39064|"“art” of argumentation and a system of technical rules for the analysis"|FALSE
39064|"and synthesis of academical discussion. Physics or Natural Philosophy"|FALSE
39064|"restricted itself to the elaboration of some metaphysical postulates or"|FALSE
39064|"hypotheses regarding the general modes of physical operation. And Ethics"|FALSE
39064|"came to be a very unpractical discussion of subtleties regarding moral"|FALSE
39064|"faculty and moral standard. Meanwhile a theory of scientific method and of"|FALSE
39064|"the laws governing the growth of intelligence and formation of ideas grew"|FALSE
39064|"up, and left the older logic to perish of formality and inanition. The"|FALSE
39064|"successive departments of physical science, each in turn asserting its"|FALSE
39064|"independence, finally left Natural Philosophy no alternative between"|FALSE
39064|"clinging to its outworn hypotheses and abstract generalities, or"|FALSE
39064|"identifying itself (as Newton in his great book put it) with the"|FALSE
39064|"_Principia Mathematica_ of the physical sciences. Ethics, in its turn, saw"|FALSE
39064|"itself, on one hand, replaced by psychological inquiries into the"|FALSE
39064|"relations between the feelings and the will and the intelligence; while,"|FALSE
39064|"on the other hand, a host of social, historical, economical, and other"|FALSE
39064|"researches cut it off from the real facts of human life, and left it no"|FALSE
39064|"more than the endless debates on the logical and metaphysical issues"|FALSE
39064|"involved in free-will and conscience, duty and merit."|FALSE
39064|"It has sometimes been said that Kant settled this controversy between the"|FALSE
39064|"old departments of philosophy and the new branches of science. And the"|FALSE
39064|"settlement, it is implied, consisted in assigning to the philosopher a"|FALSE
39064|"sort of police and patrol duty in the commonwealth of science. He was to"|FALSE
39064|"see that boundaries were duly respected, and that each science kept"|FALSE
39064|"strictly to its own business. For this purpose each branch of philosophy"|FALSE
39064|"was bound to convert itself into a department of criticism—an examination"|FALSE
39064|"of first principles in the several provinces of reality or experience—with"|FALSE
39064|"a view to get a distinct conception of what they were, and thus define"|FALSE
39064|"exactly the lines on which the structures of more detailed science could"|FALSE
39064|"be put up solidly and safely. This plan offered tempting lines to"|FALSE
39064|"research, and sounded well. But on further reflection there emerge one or"|FALSE
39064|"two difficulties, hard to get over. Paradoxical though it may seem, one"|FALSE
39064|"cannot rightly estimate the capacity and range of foundations, before one"|FALSE
39064|"has had some familiarity with the buildings erected upon them. Thus you"|FALSE
39064|"are involved in a circle: a circle which is probably inevitable, but which"|FALSE
39064|"for that reason it is well to recognise at once. Then—what is only another"|FALSE
39064|"way of saying the same thing—it is impossible to draw an inflexible line"|FALSE
39064|"between premises of principle and conclusions of detail. There is no spot"|FALSE
39064|"at which criticism can stop, and, having done its business well, hand on"|FALSE
39064|"the remaining task to dogmatic system. It was an instinctive feeling of"|FALSE
39064|"this implication of system in what professed only to be criticism which"|FALSE
39064|"led the aged Kant to ignore his own previous professions that he offered"|FALSE
39064|"as yet no system, and when Fichte maintained himself to be erecting the"|FALSE
39064|"fabric for which Kant had prepared the ground, to reply by the"|FALSE
39064|"counter-declaration that the criticism was the system—that “the curtain"|FALSE
39064|"was the picture.”"|FALSE
39064|"The Hegelian philosophy is an attempt to combine criticism with system,"|FALSE
39064|"and thus realise what Kant had at least foretold. It is a system which is"|FALSE
39064|"self-critical, and systematic only through the absoluteness of its"|FALSE
39064|"criticism. In Hegel’s own phrase, it is an immanent and an incessant"|FALSE
39064|"dialectic, which from first to last allows finality to no dogmatic rest,"|FALSE
39064|"but carries out Kant’s description of an Age of Criticism, in which"|FALSE
39064|"nothing, however majestic and sacred its authority, can plead for"|FALSE
39064|"exception from the all-testing _Elenchus_. Then, on the other hand, Hegel"|FALSE
39064|"refuses to restrict philosophy and its branches to anything short of the"|FALSE
39064|"totality. He takes in its full sense that often-used phrase—the Unity of"|FALSE
39064|"Knowledge. Logic becomes the all-embracing research of “first"|FALSE
39064|"principles,”—the principles which regulate physics and ethics. The old"|FALSE
39064|"divisions between logic and metaphysic, between induction and deduction,"|FALSE
39064|"between theory of reasoning and theory of knowledge,—divisions which those"|FALSE
39064|"who most employed them were never able to show the reason and purpose"|FALSE
39064|"of—because indeed they had grown up at various times and by “natural"|FALSE
39064|"selection” through a vast mass of incidents: these are superseded and"|FALSE
39064|"merged in one continuous theory of real knowledge considered under its"|FALSE
39064|"abstract or formal aspect,—of organised and known reality in its"|FALSE
39064|"underlying thought-system. But these first principles were only an"|FALSE
39064|"abstraction from complete reality—the reality which nature has when"|FALSE
39064|"unified by mind—and they presuppose the total from which they are derived."|FALSE
39064|"The realm of pure thought is only the ghost of the Idea—of the unity and"|FALSE
39064|"reality of knowledge, and it must be reindued with its flesh and blood."|FALSE
39064|"The logical world is (in Kantian phrase) only the _possibility_ of Nature"|FALSE
39064|"and Mind. It comes first—because it is a system of First Principles: but"|FALSE
39064|"these first principles could only be elicited by a philosophy which has"|FALSE
39064|"realised the meaning of a mental experience, gathered by interpreting the"|FALSE
39064|"facts of Nature."|FALSE
39064|"Natural Philosophy is no longer—according to Hegel’s view of it—merely a"|FALSE
39064|"scheme of mathematical ground-work. That may be its first step. But its"|FALSE
39064|"scope is a complete unity (which is not a mere aggregate) of the branches"|FALSE
39064|"of natural knowledge, exploring both the inorganic and the organic world."|FALSE
39064|"In dealing with this endless problem, philosophy seems to be baulked by an"|FALSE
39064|"impregnable obstacle to its progress. Every day the advance of"|FALSE
39064|"specialisation renders any comprehensive or synoptic view of the totality"|FALSE
39064|"of science more and more impossible. No doubt we talk readily enough of"|FALSE
39064|"Science. But here, if anywhere, we may say there is no Science, but only"|FALSE
39064|"sciences. The generality of science is a proud fiction or a gorgeous"|FALSE
39064|"dream, variously told and interpreted according to the varying interest"|FALSE
39064|"and proclivity of the scientist. The sciences, or those who specially"|FALSE
39064|"expound them, know of no unity, no philosophy of science. They are content"|FALSE
39064|"to remark that in these days the thing is impossible, and to pick out the"|FALSE
39064|"faults in any attempts in that direction that are made outside their pale."|FALSE
39064|"Unfortunately for this contention, the thing is done by us all, and,"|FALSE
39064|"indeed, has to be done. If not as men of science, yet as men—as human"|FALSE
39064|"beings—we have to put together things and form some total estimate of the"|FALSE
39064|"drift of development, of the unity of nature. To get a notion, not merely"|FALSE
39064|"of the general methods and principles of the sciences, but of their"|FALSE
39064|"results and teachings, and to get this not as a mere lot of fragments, but"|FALSE
39064|"with a systematic unity, is indispensable in some degree for all rational"|FALSE
39064|"life. The life not founded on science is not the life of man. But he will"|FALSE
39064|"not find what he wants in the text-books of the specialist, who is obliged"|FALSE
39064|"to treat his subject, as Plato says, “under the pressure of necessity,”"|FALSE
39064|"and who dare not look on it in its quality “to draw the soul towards"|FALSE
39064|"truth, and to form the philosophic intellect so as to uplift what we now"|FALSE
39064|"unduly keep down(1).” If the philosopher in this province does his work"|FALSE
39064|"but badly, he may plead the novelty of the task to which he comes as a"|FALSE
39064|"pioneer or even an architect. He finds little that he can directly"|FALSE
39064|"utilise. The materials have been gathered and prepared for very special"|FALSE
39064|"aims; and the great aim of science—that human life may be made a higher,"|FALSE
39064|"an ampler, and happier thing,—has hardly been kept in view at all, except"|FALSE
39064|"in its more materialistic aspects. To the philosopher the supreme interest"|FALSE
39064|"of the physical sciences is that man also belongs to the physical"|FALSE
39064|"universe, or that Mind and Matter as we know them are (in Mr. Spencer’s"|FALSE
39064|"language) “at once antithetical and inseparable.” He wants to find the"|FALSE
39064|"place of Man,—but of Man as Mind—in Nature."|FALSE
39064|"If the scope of Natural Philosophy be thus expanded to make it the unity"|FALSE
39064|"and more than the synthetic aggregate of the several physical sciences—to"|FALSE
39064|"make it the whole which surpasses the addition of all their fragments, the"|FALSE
39064|"purpose of Ethics has not less to be deepened and widened. Ethics, under"|FALSE
39064|"that title, Hegel knows not. And for those who cannot recognise anything"|FALSE
39064|"unless it be clearly labelled, it comes natural to record their censure of"|FALSE
39064|"Hegelianism for ignoring or disparaging ethical studies. But if we take"|FALSE
39064|"the word in that wide sense which common usage rather justifies than"|FALSE
39064|"adopts, we may say that the whole philosophy of Mind is a moral"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy. Its subject is the moral as opposed to the physical aspect of"|FALSE
39064|"reality: the inner and ideal life as opposed to the merely external and"|FALSE
39064|"real materials of it: the world of intelligence and of humanity. It"|FALSE
39064|"displays Man in the several stages of that process by which he expresses"|FALSE
39064|"the full meaning of nature, or discharges the burden of that task which is"|FALSE
39064|"implicit in him from the first. It traces the steps of that growth by"|FALSE
39064|"which what was no better than a fragment of nature—an intelligence located"|FALSE
39064|"(as it seemed) in one piece of matter—comes to realise the truth of it and"|FALSE
39064|"of himself. That truth is his ideal and his obligation: but it is"|FALSE
39064|"also—such is the mystery of his birthright—his idea and possession."|FALSE
39064|"He—like the natural universe—is (as the _Logic_ has shown) a principle of"|FALSE
39064|"unification, organisation, idealisation: and his history (in its ideal"|FALSE
39064|"completeness) is the history of the process by which he, the typical man,"|FALSE
39064|"works the fragments of reality (and such mere reality must be always a"|FALSE
39064|"collection of fragments) into the perfect unity of a many-sided character."|FALSE
39064|"Thus the philosophy of mind, beginning with man as a sentient organism,"|FALSE
39064|"the focus in which the universe gets its first dim confused expression"|FALSE
39064|"through mere feeling, shows how he “erects himself above himself” and"|FALSE
39064|"realises what ancient thinkers called his kindred with the divine."|FALSE
39064|"In that total process of the mind’s liberation and self-realisation the"|FALSE
39064|"portion specially called Morals is but one, though a necessary, stage."|FALSE
39064|"There are, said Porphyry and the later Platonists, four degrees in the"|FALSE
39064|"path of perfection and self-accomplishment. And first, there is the career"|FALSE
39064|"of honesty and worldly prudence, which makes the duty of the citizen."|FALSE
39064|"Secondly, there is the progress in purity which casts earthly things"|FALSE
39064|"behind, and reaches the angelic height of passionless serenity. And the"|FALSE
39064|"third step is the divine life which by intellectual energy is turned to"|FALSE
39064|"behold the truth of things. Lastly, in the fourth grade, the mind, free"|FALSE
39064|"and sublime in self-sustaining wisdom, makes itself an “exemplar” of"|FALSE
39064|"virtue, and is even a “father of Gods.” Even so, it may be said, the human"|FALSE
39064|"mind is the subject of a complicated Teleology,—the field ruled by a"|FALSE
39064|"multifarious Ought, psychological, aesthetical, social and religious. To"|FALSE
39064|"adjust their several claims cannot be the object of any science, if"|FALSE
39064|"adjustment means to supply a guide in practice. But it is the purpose of"|FALSE
39064|"such a teleology to show that social requirements and moral duty as"|FALSE
39064|"ordinarily conceived do not exhaust the range of obligation,—of the"|FALSE
39064|"supreme ethical Ought. How that can best be done is however a question of"|FALSE
39064|"some difficulty. For the ends under examination do not fall completely"|FALSE
39064|"into a serial order, nor does one involve others in such a way as to"|FALSE
39064|"destroy their independence. You cannot absolve psychology as if it stood"|FALSE
39064|"independent of ethics or religion, nor can aesthetic considerations merely"|FALSE
39064|"supervene on moral. Still, it may be said, the order followed by Hegel"|FALSE
39064|"seems on the whole liable to fewer objections than others."|FALSE
39064|"Mr. Herbert Spencer, the only English philosopher who has even attempted a"|FALSE
39064|"_System_ of Philosophy, may in this point be compared with Hegel. He also"|FALSE
39064|"begins with a _First Principles_,—a work which, like Hegel’s _Logic_,"|FALSE
39064|"starts by presenting Philosophy as the supreme arbiter between the"|FALSE
39064|"subordinate principles of Religion and Science, which are in it “necessary"|FALSE
39064|"correlatives.” The positive task of philosophy is (with some inconsistency"|FALSE
39064|"or vagueness) presented, in the next place, as a “unification of"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge.” Such a unification has to make explicit the implicit unity of"|FALSE
39064|"known reality: because “every thought involves a whole system of"|FALSE
39064|"thoughts.” And such a programme might again suggest the Logic. But"|FALSE
39064|"unfortunately Mr. Spencer does not (and he has Francis Bacon to justify"|FALSE
39064|"him here) think it worth his while to toil up the weary, but necessary,"|FALSE
39064|"mount of Purgatory which is known to us as Logic. With a naïve realism, he"|FALSE
39064|"builds on Cause and Power, and above all on Force, that “Ultimate of"|FALSE
39064|"Ultimates,” which seems to be, however marvellously, a denizen both of the"|FALSE
39064|"Known and the Unknowable world. In the known world this Ultimate appears"|FALSE
39064|"under two forms, matter and motion, and the problem of science and"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy is to lay down in detail and in general the law of their"|FALSE
39064|"continuous redistribution, of the segregation of motion from matter, and"|FALSE
39064|"the inclusion of motion into matter."|FALSE
39064|"Of this process, which has no beginning and no end,—the rhythm of"|FALSE
39064|"generation and corruption, attraction and repulsion, it may be said that"|FALSE
39064|"it is properly not a first principle of all knowledge, but the general or"|FALSE
39064|"fundamental portion of Natural Philosophy to which Mr. Spencer next"|FALSE
39064|"proceeds. Such a philosophy, however, he gives only in part: viz. as a"|FALSE
39064|"Biology, dealing with organic (and at a further stage and under other"|FALSE

39064|"take this form, and carry both the First Principles and the later portions"|FALSE
39064|"of the system with it, as parts of a philosophy of evolution, is what we"|FALSE
39064|"should have expected from the contemporaneous interests of science(2)."|FALSE
39064|"Even a one-sided attempt to give speculative unity to those researches,"|FALSE
39064|"which get—for reasons the scientific specialist seldom asks—the title of"|FALSE
39064|"biological, is however worth noting as a recognition of the necessity of a"|FALSE
39064|"_Natur-philosophie_,—a speculative science of Nature."|FALSE
39064|"The third part of the Hegelian System corresponds to what in the"|FALSE
39064|"_Synthetic Philosophy_ is known as Psychology, Ethics, and Sociology. And"|FALSE
39064|"here Mr. Spencer recognises that something new has turned up. Psychology"|FALSE
39064|"is “unique” as a science: it is a “double science,” and as a whole quite"|FALSE
39064|"_sui generis_. Whether perhaps all these epithets would not, _mutatis"|FALSE
39064|"mutandis_, have to be applied also to Ethics and Sociology, if these are"|FALSE
39064|"to do their full work, he does not say. In what this doubleness consists"|FALSE
39064|"he even finds it somewhat difficult to show. For, as his fundamental"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy does not on this point go beyond noting some pairs of verbal"|FALSE
39064|"antitheses, and has no sense of unity except in the imperfect shape of a"|FALSE
39064|"“relation(3)” between two things which are “antithetical and inseparable,”"|FALSE
39064|"he is perplexed by phrases such as “in” and “out of” consciousness, and"|FALSE
39064|"stumbles over the equivocal use of “inner” to denote both mental (or"|FALSE
39064|"non-spatial) in general, and locally sub-cuticular in special. Still, he"|FALSE
39064|"gets so far as to see that the law of consciousness is that in it neither"|FALSE
39064|"feelings nor relations have independent subsistence, and that the unit of"|FALSE
39064|"mind does not begin till what he calls two feelings are made one. The"|FALSE
39064|"phraseology may be faulty, but it shows an inkling of the _a priori_."|FALSE
39064|"Unfortunately it is apparently forgotten; and the language too often"|FALSE
39064|"reverts into the habit of what he calls the “objective,” i.e. purely"|FALSE
39064|"physical, sciences."|FALSE
39064|"Mr. Spencer’s conception of Psychology restricts it to the more general"|FALSE
39064|"physics of the mind. For its more concrete life he refers us to Sociology."|FALSE
39064|"But his Sociology is yet unfinished: and from the plan of its inception,"|FALSE
39064|"and the imperfect conception of the ends and means of its investigation,"|FALSE
39064|"hardly admits of completion in any systematic sense. To that incipiency is"|FALSE
39064|"no doubt due its excess in historical or anecdotal detail—detail, however,"|FALSE
39064|"too much segregated from its social context, and in general its tendency"|FALSE
39064|"to neglect normal and central theory for incidental and peripheral facts."|FALSE
39064|"Here, too, there is a weakness in First Principles and a love of"|FALSE
39064|"catchwords, which goes along with the fallacy that illustration is proof."|FALSE
39064|"Above all, it is evident that the great fact of religion overhangs Mr."|FALSE
39064|"Spencer with the attraction of an unsolved and unacceptable problem. He"|FALSE
39064|"cannot get the religious ideas of men into co-ordination with their"|FALSE
39064|"scientific, aesthetic, and moral doctrines; and only betrays his sense of"|FALSE
39064|"the high importance of the former by placing them in the forefront of"|FALSE
39064|"inquiry, as due to the inexperience and limitations of the so-called"|FALSE
39064|"primitive man. That is hardly adequate recognition of the religious"|FALSE
39064|"principle: and the defect will make itself seriously felt, should he ever"|FALSE
39064|"come to carry out the further stage of his prospectus dealing with “the"|FALSE
39064|"growth and correlation of language, knowledge, morals, and aesthetics.”"|FALSE
39064|"(ii.) Mind and Morals."|FALSE
39064|"A Mental Philosophy—if we so put what might also be rendered a Spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"Philosophy, or Philosophy of Spirit—may to an English reader suggest"|FALSE
39064|"something much narrower than it actually contains. A Philosophy of the"|FALSE
39064|"Human Mind—if we consult English specimens—would not imply much more than"|FALSE
39064|"a psychology, and probably what is called an inductive psychology. But as"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel understands it, it covers an unexpectedly wide range of topics, the"|FALSE
39064|"whole range from Nature to Spirit. Besides Subjective Mind, which would"|FALSE
39064|"seem on first thoughts to exhaust the topics of psychology, it goes on to"|FALSE
39064|"Mind as Objective, and finally to Absolute mind. And such combinations of"|FALSE
39064|"words may sound either self-contradictory or meaningless."|FALSE
39064|"The first Section deals with the range of what is usually termed"|FALSE
39064|"Psychology. That term indeed is employed by Hegel, in a restricted sense,"|FALSE
39064|"to denote the last of the three sub-sections in the discussion of"|FALSE
39064|"Subjective Mind. The Mind, which is the topic of psychology proper, cannot"|FALSE
39064|"be assumed as a ready-made object, or datum. A Self, a self-consciousness,"|FALSE
39064|"an intelligent and volitional agent, if it be the birthright of man, is a"|FALSE
39064|"birthright which he has to realise for himself, to earn and to make his"|FALSE
39064|"own. To trace the steps by which mind in its stricter acceptation, as will"|FALSE
39064|"and intelligence, emerges from the general animal sensibility which is the"|FALSE
39064|"crowning phase of organic life, and the final problem of biology, is the"|FALSE
39064|"work of two preliminary sub-sections—the first entitled _Anthropology_,"|FALSE
39064|"the second the _Phenomenology of Mind_."|FALSE
39064|"The subject of Anthropology, as Hegel understands it, is the Soul—the raw"|FALSE
39064|"material of consciousness, the basis of all higher mental life. This is a"|FALSE
39064|"borderland, where the ground is still debateable between Nature and Mind:"|FALSE
39064|"it is the region of feeling, where the sensibility has not yet been"|FALSE
39064|"differentiated to intelligence. Soul and body are here, as the phrase"|FALSE
39064|"goes, in communion: the inward life is still imperfectly disengaged from"|FALSE
39064|"its natural co-physical setting. Still one with nature, it submits to"|FALSE
39064|"natural influences and natural vicissitudes: is not as yet master of"|FALSE
39064|"itself, but the half-passive receptacle of a foreign life, of a general"|FALSE
39064|"vitality, of a common soul not yet fully differentiated into"|FALSE
39064|"individuality. But it is awaking to self-activity: it is emerging to"|FALSE
39064|"Consciousness,—to distinguish itself, as aware and conscious, from the"|FALSE
39064|"facts of life and sentiency of which it is aware."|FALSE
39064|"From this region of psychical physiology or physiological psychology,"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel in the second sub-section of his first part takes us to the"|FALSE
39064|"“Phenomenology of Mind,”—to Consciousness. The sentient soul is also"|FALSE
39064|"conscious—but in a looser sense of that word(4): it has feelings, but can"|FALSE
39064|"scarcely be said _itself_ to know that it has them. As consciousness, the"|FALSE
39064|"Soul has come to separate what it is from what it feels. The distinction"|FALSE
39064|"emerges of a subject which is conscious, and an object _of_ which it is"|FALSE
39064|"conscious. And the main thing is obviously the relationship between the"|FALSE
39064|"two, or the Consciousness itself, as tending to distinguish itself alike"|FALSE
39064|"from its subject and its object. Hence, perhaps, may be gathered why it is"|FALSE
39064|"called Phenomenology of Mind. Mind as yet is not yet more than emergent or"|FALSE
39064|"apparent: nor yet self-possessed and self-certified. No longer, however,"|FALSE
39064|"one with the circumambient nature which it feels, it sees itself set"|FALSE
39064|"against it, but only as a passive recipient of it, a _tabula rasa_ on"|FALSE
39064|"which external nature is reflected, or to which phenomena are presented."|FALSE
39064|"No longer, on the other hand, a mere passive instrument of suggestion from"|FALSE
39064|"without, its instinct of life, its _nisus_ of self-assertion is developed,"|FALSE
39064|"through antagonism to a like _nisus_, into the consciousness of self-hood,"|FALSE
39064|"of a Me and Mine as set against a Thee and Thine. But just in proportion"|FALSE
39064|"as it is so developed in opposition to and recognition of other equally"|FALSE
39064|"self-centred selves, it has passed beyond the narrower characteristic of"|FALSE
39064|"Consciousness proper. It is no longer mere intelligent perception or"|FALSE
39064|"reproduction of a world, but it is life, with perception (or apperception)"|FALSE
39064|"of that life. It has returned in a way to its original unity with nature,"|FALSE
39064|"but it is now the sense of its self-hood—the consciousness of itself as"|FALSE
39064|"the focus in which subjective and objective are at one. Or, to put it in"|FALSE
39064|"the language of the great champion of Realism(5), the standpoint of Reason"|FALSE
39064|"or full-grown Mind is this: “The world which appears to us is our percept,"|FALSE
39064|"therefore in us. The real world, out of which we explain the phenomenon,"|FALSE
39064|"is our thought: therefore in us.”"|FALSE
39064|"The third sub-section of the theory of Subjective Mind—the Psychology"|FALSE
39064|"proper—deals with Mind. This is the real, independent Psyché—hence the"|FALSE
39064|"special appropriation of the term Psychology. “The Soul,” says Herbart,"|FALSE
39064|"“no doubt dwells in a body: there are, moreover, corresponding states of"|FALSE
39064|"the one and the other: but nothing corporeal occurs in the Soul, nothing"|FALSE
39064|"purely mental, which we could reckon to our Ego, occurs in the body: the"|FALSE
39064|"affections of the body are no representations of the Ego, and our pleasant"|FALSE
39064|"and unpleasant feelings do not immediately lie in the organic life they"|FALSE
39064|"favour or hinder.” Such a Soul, so conceived, is an intelligent and"|FALSE
39064|"volitional self, a being of intellectual and “active” powers or phenomena:"|FALSE
39064|"it is a Mind. And “Mind,” adds Hegel(6), “is just this elevation above"|FALSE
39064|"Nature and physical modes and above the complication with an external"|FALSE
39064|"object.” Nothing is _external_ to it: it is rather the internalising of"|FALSE
39064|"all externality. In this psychology proper, we are out of any immediate"|FALSE
39064|"connexion with physiology. “Psychology as such,” remarks Herbart, “has its"|FALSE
39064|"questions common to it with Idealism”—with the doctrine that all reality"|FALSE
39064|"is mental reality. It traces, in Hegel’s exposition of it, the steps of"|FALSE
39064|"the way by which mind realises that independence which is its"|FALSE
39064|"characteristic stand-point. On the intellectual side that independence is"|FALSE
39064|"assured in language,—the system of signs by which the intelligence stamps"|FALSE
39064|"external objects as its own, made part of its inner world. A science, some"|FALSE
39064|"one has said, is after all only _une langue bien faite_. So, reversing the"|FALSE
39064|"saying, we may note that a language is an inwardised and mind-appropriated"|FALSE
39064|"world. On the active side, the independence of mind is seen in"|FALSE
39064|"self-enjoyment, in happiness, or self-content, where impulse and volition"|FALSE
39064|"have attained satisfaction in equilibrium, and the soul possesses itself"|FALSE
39064|"in fullness. Such a mind(7), which has made the world its certified"|FALSE
39064|"possession in language, and which enjoys itself in self-possession of"|FALSE
39064|"soul, called happiness, is a free Mind. And that is the highest which"|FALSE
39064|"Subjective Mind can reach."|FALSE
39064|"At this point, perhaps, having rounded off by a liberal sweep the scope of"|FALSE
39064|"psychology, the ordinary mental philosophy would stop. Hegel, instead of"|FALSE
39064|"finishing, now goes on to the field of what he calls Objective Mind. For"|FALSE
39064|"as yet it has been only the story of a preparation, an inward adorning and"|FALSE
39064|"equipment, and we have yet to see what is to come of it in actuality. Or"|FALSE
39064|"rather, we have yet to consider the social forms on which this preparation"|FALSE
39064|"rests. The mind, self-possessed and sure of itself or free, is so only"|FALSE
39064|"through the objective shape which its main development runs parallel with."|FALSE
39064|"An intelligent Will, or a practical reason, was the last word of the"|FALSE
39064|"psychological development. But a reason which is practical, or a volition"|FALSE
39064|"which is intelligent, is realised by action which takes regular shapes,"|FALSE
39064|"and by practice which transforms the world. The theory of Objective Mind"|FALSE
39064|"delineates the new form which nature assumes under the sway of"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence and will. That intellectual world realises itself by"|FALSE
39064|"transforming the physical into a social and political world, the given"|FALSE
39064|"natural conditions of existence into a freely-instituted system of life,"|FALSE
39064|"the primitive struggle of kinds for subsistence into the ordinances of the"|FALSE
39064|"social state. Given man as a being possessed of will and intelligence,"|FALSE
39064|"this inward faculty, whatever be its degree, will try to impress itself on"|FALSE
39064|"nature and to reproduce itself in a legal, a moral, and social world. The"|FALSE
39064|"kingdom of deed replaces, or rises on the foundation of, the kingdom of"|FALSE
39064|"word: and instead of the equilibrium of a well-adjusted soul comes the"|FALSE
39064|"harmonious life of a social organism. We are, in short, in the sphere of"|FALSE
39064|"Ethics and Politics, of Jurisprudence and Morals, of Law and Conscience."|FALSE
39064|"Here,—as always in Hegel’s system—there is a triad of steps. First the"|FALSE
39064|"province of Law or Right. But if we call it Law, we must keep out of sight"|FALSE
39064|"the idea of a special law-giver, of a conscious imposition of laws, above"|FALSE
39064|"all by a political superior. And if we call it Right, we must remember"|FALSE
39064|"that it is neutral, inhuman, abstract right: the right whose principle is"|FALSE
39064|"impartial and impassive uniformity, equality, order;—not moral right, or"|FALSE
39064|"the equity which takes cognisance of circumstances, of personal claims,"|FALSE
39064|"and provides against its own hardness. The intelligent will of Man,"|FALSE
39064|"throwing itself upon the mere gifts of nature as their appointed master,"|FALSE
39064|"creates the world of Property—of things instrumental, and regarded as"|FALSE
39064|"adjectival, to the human personality. But the autonomy of Reason (which is"|FALSE
39064|"latent in the will) carries with it certain consequences. As it acts, it"|FALSE
39064|"also, by its inherent quality of uniformity or universality, enacts for"|FALSE
39064|"itself a law and laws, and creates the realm of formal equality or"|FALSE
39064|"order-giving law. But this is a _mere_ equality: which is not inconsistent"|FALSE
39064|"with what in other respects may be excess of inequality. What one does, if"|FALSE
39064|"it is really to be treated as done, others may or even must do: each act"|FALSE
39064|"creates an expectation of continuance and uniformity of behaviour. The"|FALSE
39064|"doer is bound by it, and others are entitled to do the like. The material"|FALSE
39064|"which the person appropriates creates a system of obligation. Thus is"|FALSE
39064|"constituted—in the natural give and take of rational Wills—in the"|FALSE
39064|"inevitable course of human action and reaction,—a system of rights and"|FALSE
39064|"duties. This law of equality—the basis of justice, and the seed of"|FALSE
39064|"benevolence—is the scaffolding or perhaps rather the rudimentary framework"|FALSE
39064|"of society and moral life. Or it is the bare skeleton which is to be"|FALSE
39064|"clothed upon by the softer and fuller outlines of the social tissues and"|FALSE
39064|"the ethical organs."|FALSE
39064|"And thus the first range of Objective Mind postulates the second, which"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel calls “Morality.” The word is to be taken in its strict sense as a"|FALSE
39064|"protest against the quasi-physical order of law. It is the morality of"|FALSE
39064|"conscience and of the good will, of the inner rectitude of soul and"|FALSE
39064|"purpose, as all-sufficient and supreme. Here is brought out the"|FALSE
39064|"complementary factor in social life: the element of liberty, spontaneity,"|FALSE
39064|"self-consciousness. The motto of mere inward morality (as opposed to the"|FALSE
39064|"spirit of legality) is (in Kant’s words): “There is nothing without"|FALSE
39064|"qualification good, in heaven or earth, but only a good will.” The"|FALSE
39064|"essential condition of goodness is that the action be done with purpose"|FALSE
39064|"and intelligence, and in full persuasion of its goodness by the conscience"|FALSE
39064|"of the agent. The characteristic of Morality thus described is its"|FALSE
39064|"essential inwardness, and the sovereignty of the conscience over all"|FALSE
39064|"heteronomy. Its justification is that it protests against the authority of"|FALSE
39064|"a mere external or objective order, subsisting and ruling in separation"|FALSE
39064|"from the subjectivity. Its defect is the turn it gives to this assertion"|FALSE
39064|"of the rights of subjective conscience: briefly in the circumstance that"|FALSE
39064|"it tends to set up a mere individualism against a mere universalism,"|FALSE
39064|"instead of realising the unity and essential interdependence of the two."|FALSE
39064|"The third sub-section of the theory of Objective Mind describes a state of"|FALSE
39064|"affairs in which this antithesis is explicitly overcome. This is the moral"|FALSE
39064|"life in a social community. Here law and usage prevail and provide the"|FALSE
39064|"fixed permanent scheme of life: but the law and the usage are, in their"|FALSE
39064|"true or ideal conception, only the unforced expression of the mind and"|FALSE
39064|"will of those who live under them. And, on the other hand, the mind and"|FALSE
39064|"will of the individual members of such a community are pervaded and"|FALSE
39064|"animated by its universal spirit. In such a community, and so constituting"|FALSE
39064|"it, the individual is at once free and equal, and that because of the"|FALSE
39064|"spirit of fraternity, which forms its spiritual link. In the world"|FALSE
39064|"supposed to be governed by mere legality the idea of right is exclusively"|FALSE
39064|"prominent; and when that is the case, it may often happen that _summum jus"|FALSE
39064|"summa injuria_. In mere morality, the stress falls exclusively on the idea"|FALSE
39064|"of inward freedom, or the necessity of the harmony of the judgment and the"|FALSE
39064|"will, or the dependence of conduct upon conscience. In the union of the"|FALSE
39064|"two, in the moral community as normally constituted, the mere idea of"|FALSE
39064|"right is replaced, or controlled and modified, by the idea of equity—a"|FALSE
39064|"balance as it were between the two preceding, inasmuch as motive and"|FALSE
39064|"purpose are employed to modify and interpret strict right. But this"|FALSE
39064|"effect—this harmonisation—is brought about by the predominance of a new"|FALSE
39064|"idea—the principle of benevolence,—a principle however which is itself"|FALSE
39064|"modified by the fundamental idea of right or law(8) into a wise or"|FALSE
39064|"regulated kindliness."|FALSE
39064|"But what Hegel chiefly deals with under this head is the interdependence"|FALSE
39064|"of form and content, of social order and personal progress. In the picture"|FALSE
39064|"of an ethical organisation or harmoniously-alive moral community he shows"|FALSE
39064|"us partly the underlying idea which gave room for the antithesis between"|FALSE
39064|"law and conscience, and partly the outlines of the ideal in which that"|FALSE
39064|"conflict becomes only the instrument of progress. This organisation has"|FALSE
39064|"three grades or three typical aspects. These are the Family, Civil"|FALSE
39064|"Society, and the State. The first of these, the Family, must be taken to"|FALSE
39064|"include those primary unities of human life where the natural affinity of"|FALSE
39064|"sex and the natural ties of parentage are the preponderant influence in"|FALSE
39064|"forming and maintaining the social group. This, as it were, is the"|FALSE
39064|"soul-nucleus of social organisation: where the principle of unity is an"|FALSE
39064|"instinct, a feeling, an absorbing solidarity. Next comes what Hegel has"|FALSE
39064|"called Civil Society,—meaning however by civil the antithesis to"|FALSE
39064|"political, the society of those who may be styled _bourgeois_, not"|FALSE
39064|"_citoyens_:—and meaning by society the antithesis to community. There are"|FALSE
39064|"other natural influences binding men together besides those which form the"|FALSE
39064|"close unities of the family, gens, tribe, or clan. Economical needs"|FALSE
39064|"associate human beings within a much larger radius—in ways capable of"|FALSE
39064|"almost indefinite expansion—but also in a way much less intense and deep."|FALSE
39064|"Civil Society is the more or less loosely organised aggregate of such"|FALSE
39064|"associations, which, if, on one hand, they keep human life from stagnating"|FALSE
39064|"in the mere family, on another, accentuate more sharply the tendency to"|FALSE
39064|"competition and the struggle for life. Lastly, in the Political State"|FALSE
39064|"comes the synthesis of family and society. Of the family; in so far as the"|FALSE
39064|"State tends to develope itself on the nature-given unit of the Nation (an"|FALSE
39064|"extended family, supplementing as need arises real descent by fictitious"|FALSE
39064|"incorporations), and has apparently never permanently maintained itself"|FALSE
39064|"except on the basis of a predominant common nationality. Of society; in so"|FALSE
39064|"far as the extension and dispersion of family ties have left free room for"|FALSE
39064|"the differentiation of many other sides of human interest and action, and"|FALSE
39064|"given ground for the full development of individuality. In consequence of"|FALSE
39064|"this, the State (and such a state as Hegel describes is essentially the"|FALSE
39064|"idea or ideal of the modern State)(9) has a certain artificial air about"|FALSE
39064|"it. It can only be maintained by the free action of intelligence: it must"|FALSE
39064|"make its laws public: it must bring to consciousness the principles of its"|FALSE
39064|"constitution, and create agencies for keeping up unity of organisation"|FALSE
39064|"through the several separate provinces or contending social interests,"|FALSE
39064|"each of which is inclined to insist on the right of home mis-rule."|FALSE
39064|"The State—which in its actuality must always be a quasi-national state—is"|FALSE
39064|"thus the supreme unity of Nature and Mind. Its natural basis in land,"|FALSE
39064|"language, blood, and the many ties which spring therefrom, has to be"|FALSE
39064|"constantly raised into an intelligent unity through universal interests."|FALSE
39064|"But the elements of race and of culture have no essential connexion, and"|FALSE
39064|"they perpetually incline to wrench themselves asunder. Blood and judgment"|FALSE
39064|"are for ever at war in the state as in the individual(10): the"|FALSE
39064|"cosmopolitan interest, to which the maxim is _Ubi bene, ibi patria_,"|FALSE
39064|"resists the national, which adopts the patriotic watchword of Hector(11)."|FALSE
39064|"The State however has another source of danger in the very principle that"|FALSE
39064|"gave it birth. It arose through antagonism: it was baptised on the"|FALSE
39064|"battlefield, and it only lives as it is able to assert itself against a"|FALSE
39064|"foreign foe. And this circumstance tends to intensify and even pervert its"|FALSE
39064|"natural basis of nationality:—tends to give the very conception of the"|FALSE
39064|"political a negative and superficial look. But, notwithstanding all these"|FALSE
39064|"drawbacks, the State in its Idea is entitled to the name Hobbes gave"|FALSE
39064|"it,—the Mortal God. Here in a way culminates the obviously objective,—we"|FALSE
39064|"may almost say, visible and tangible—development of Man and Mind. Here it"|FALSE
39064|"attains a certain completeness—a union of reality and of ideality: a"|FALSE
39064|"quasi-immortality, a quasi-universality. What the individual person could"|FALSE
39064|"not do unaided, he can do in the strength of his commonwealth. Much that"|FALSE
39064|"in the solitary was but implicit or potential, is in the State actualised."|FALSE
39064|"But the God of the State is a mortal God. It is but a national and a"|FALSE
39064|"limited mind. To be actual, one must at least begin by restricting"|FALSE
39064|"oneself. Or, rather actuality is rational, but always with a conditioned"|FALSE
39064|"and a relative rationality(12): it is in the realm of action and"|FALSE
39064|"re-action,—in the realm of change and nature. It has warring forces"|FALSE
39064|"outside it,—warring forces inside it. Its unity is never perfect: because"|FALSE
39064|"it never produces a true identity of interests within, or maintains an"|FALSE
39064|"absolute independence without. Thus the true and real State—the State in"|FALSE
39064|"its Idea—the realisation of concrete humanity,—of Mind as the fullness and"|FALSE
39064|"unity of nature—is not reached in any single or historical State: but"|FALSE
39064|"floats away, when we try to seize it, into the endless progress of"|FALSE
39064|"history. Always indeed the State, the historical and objective, points"|FALSE
39064|"beyond itself. It does so first in the succession of times. _Die"|FALSE
39064|"Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht._(13) And in that doom of the world the"|FALSE
39064|"eternal blast sweeps along the successive generations of the temporal, one"|FALSE
39064|"expelling another from the stage of time—each because it is inadequate to"|FALSE
39064|"the Idea which it tried to express, and has succumbed to an enemy from"|FALSE
39064|"without because it was not a real and true unity within."|FALSE
39064|"But if temporal flees away before another temporal, it abides in so far as"|FALSE
39064|"it has, however inadequately, given expression and visible reality—as it"|FALSE
39064|"points inward and upward—to the eternal. The earthly state is also the"|FALSE
39064|"city of God; and if the republic of Plato seems to find scant admission"|FALSE
39064|"into the reality of flesh and blood, it stands eternal as a witness in the"|FALSE
39064|"heaven of idea. Behind the fleeting succession of consulates and"|FALSE
39064|"dictatures, of aristocracy and empire, feuds of plebeian with patrician,"|FALSE
39064|"in that apparent anarchy of powers which the so-called Roman constitution"|FALSE
39064|"is to the superficial observer, there is the eternal Rome, one, strong,"|FALSE
39064|"victorious, _semper eadem_: the Rome of Virgil and Justinian, the ghost"|FALSE
39064|"whereof still haunts with memories the seven-hilled city, but which with"|FALSE
39064|"full spiritual presence lives in the law, the literature, the manners of"|FALSE
39064|"the modern world. To find fitter expression for this Absolute Mind than it"|FALSE
39064|"has in the Ethical community—to reach that reality of which the moral"|FALSE
39064|"world is but one-sidedly representative—is the work of Art, Religion, and"|FALSE
39064|"Philosophy. And to deal with these efforts to find the truth and the unity"|FALSE
39064|"of Mind and Nature is the subject of Hegel’s third Section."|FALSE
39064|"(iii.) Religion and Philosophy."|FALSE
39064|"It may be well at this point to guard against a misconception of this"|FALSE
39064|"serial order of exposition(14). As stage is seen to follow stage, the"|FALSE
39064|"historical imagination, which governs our ordinary current of ideas, turns"|FALSE
39064|"the logical dependence into a time-sequence. But it is of course not meant"|FALSE
39064|"that the later stage follows the earlier in history. The later is the more"|FALSE
39064|"real, and therefore the more fundamental. But we can only understand by"|FALSE
39064|"abstracting and then transcending our abstractions, or rather by showing"|FALSE
39064|"how the abstraction implies relations which force us to go further and"|FALSE
39064|"beyond our arbitrary arrest. Each stage therefore either stands to that"|FALSE
39064|"preceding it as an antithesis, which inevitably dogs its steps as an"|FALSE
39064|"accusing spirit, or it is the conjunction of the original thesis with the"|FALSE
39064|"antithesis, in a union which should not be called synthesis because it is"|FALSE
39064|"a closer fusion and true marriage of minds. A truth and reality, though"|FALSE
39064|"fundamental, is only appreciated at its true value and seen in all its"|FALSE
39064|"force where it appears as the reconciliation and reunion of partial and"|FALSE
39064|"opposing points of view. Thus, e.g., the full significance of the State"|FALSE
39064|"does not emerge so long as we view it in isolation as a supposed single"|FALSE
39064|"state, but only as it is seen in the conflict of history, in its actual"|FALSE
39064|"“energy” as a world-power among powers, always pointing beyond itself to a"|FALSE
39064|"something universal which it fain would be, and yet cannot be. Or, again,"|FALSE
39064|"there never was a civil or economic society which existed save under the"|FALSE
39064|"wing of a state, or in one-sided assumption of state powers to itself: and"|FALSE
39064|"a family is no isolated and independent unit belonging to a supposed"|FALSE
39064|"patriarchal age, but was always mixed up with, and in manifold dependence"|FALSE
39064|"upon, political and civil combinations. The true family, indeed, far from"|FALSE
39064|"preceding the state in time, presupposes the political power to give it"|FALSE
39064|"its precise sphere and its social stability: as is well illustrated by"|FALSE
39064|"that typical form of it presented in the Roman state."|FALSE
39064|"So, again, religion does not supervene upon an already existing political"|FALSE
39064|"and moral system and invest it with an additional sanction. The true order"|FALSE
39064|"would be better described as the reverse. The real basis of social life,"|FALSE
39064|"and even of intelligence, is religion. As some thinkers quaintly put it,"|FALSE
39064|"the known rests and lives on the bosom of the Unknowable. But when we say"|FALSE
39064|"that, we must at once guard against a misconception. There are religions"|FALSE
39064|"of all sorts; and some of them which are most heard of in the modern world"|FALSE
39064|"only exist or survive in the shape of a traditional name and venerated"|FALSE
39064|"creed which has lost its power. Nor is a religion necessarily committed to"|FALSE
39064|"a definite conception of a supernatural—of a personal power outside the"|FALSE
39064|"order of Nature. But in all cases, religion is a faith and a theory which"|FALSE
39064|"gives unity to the facts of life, and gives it, not because the unity is"|FALSE
39064|"in detail proved or detected, but because life and experience in their"|FALSE
39064|"deepest reality inexorably demand and evince such a unity to the heart."|FALSE
39064|"The religion of a time is not its nominal creed, but its dominant"|FALSE
39064|"conviction of the meaning of reality, the principle which animates all its"|FALSE
39064|"being and all its striving, the faith it has in the laws of nature and the"|FALSE
39064|"purpose of life. Dimly or clearly felt and perceived, religion has for its"|FALSE
39064|"principle (one cannot well say, its object) not the unknowable, but the"|FALSE
39064|"inner unity of life and knowledge, of act and consciousness, a unity which"|FALSE
39064|"is certified in its every knowledge, but is never fully demonstrable by"|FALSE
39064|"the summation of all its ascertained items. As such a felt and believed"|FALSE
39064|"synthesis of the world and life, religion is the unity which gives"|FALSE
39064|"stability and harmony to the social sphere; just as morality in its turn"|FALSE
39064|"gives a partial and practical realisation to the ideal of religion. But"|FALSE
39064|"religion does not merely establish and sanction morality; it also frees it"|FALSE
39064|"from a certain narrowness it always has, as of the earth. Or, otherwise"|FALSE
39064|"put, morality has to the keener inspection something in it which is more"|FALSE
39064|"than the mere moral injunction at first indicates. Beyond the moral, in"|FALSE
39064|"its stricter sense, as the obligatory duty and the obedience to law, rises"|FALSE
39064|"and expands the beautiful and the good: a beautiful which is"|FALSE
39064|"disinterestedly loved, and a goodness which has thrown off all utilitarian"|FALSE
39064|"relativity, and become a free self-enhancing joy. The true spirit of"|FALSE
39064|"religion sees in the divine judgment not a mere final sanction to human"|FALSE
39064|"morality which has failed of its earthly close, not the re-adjustment of"|FALSE
39064|"social and political judgments in accordance with our more conscientious"|FALSE
39064|"inner standards, but a certain, though, for our part-by-part vision,"|FALSE
39064|"incalculable proportion between what is done and suffered. And in this"|FALSE
39064|"liberation of the moral from its restrictions, Art renders no slight aid."|FALSE
39064|"Thus in different ways, religion presupposes morality to fill up its"|FALSE
39064|"vacant form, and morality presupposes religion to give its laws an"|FALSE
39064|"ultimate sanction, which at the same time points beyond their limitations."|FALSE
39064|"But art, religion, and philosophy still rest on the national culture and"|FALSE
39064|"on the individual mind. However much they rise in the heights of the ideal"|FALSE
39064|"world, they never leave the reality of life and circumstance behind, and"|FALSE
39064|"float in the free empyrean. Yet there are degrees of universality, degrees"|FALSE
39064|"in which they reach what they promised. As the various psychical _nuclei_"|FALSE
39064|"of an individual consciousness tend through the course of experience to"|FALSE
39064|"gather round a central idea and by fusion and assimilation form a complete"|FALSE
39064|"mental organisation; so, through the march of history, there grows up a"|FALSE
39064|"complication and a fusion of national ideas and aspirations, which, though"|FALSE
39064|"still retaining the individuality and restriction of a concrete national"|FALSE
39064|"life, ultimately present an organisation social, aesthetic, and religious"|FALSE
39064|"which is a type of humanity in its universality and completeness. Always"|FALSE
39064|"moving in the measure and on the lines of the real development of its"|FALSE
39064|"social organisation, the art and religion of a nation tend to give"|FALSE
39064|"expression to what social and political actuality at its best but"|FALSE
39064|"imperfectly sets in existence. They come more and more to be, not mere"|FALSE
39064|"competing fragments as set side by side with those of others, but"|FALSE
39064|"comparatively equal and complete representations of the many-sided and"|FALSE
39064|"many-voiced reality of man and the world. Yet always they live and"|FALSE
39064|"flourish in reciprocity with the fullness of practical institutions and"|FALSE
39064|"individual character. An abstractly universal art and religion is a"|FALSE
39064|"delusion—until all diversities of geography and climate, of language and"|FALSE
39064|"temperament, have been made to disappear. If these energies are in power"|FALSE
39064|"and reality and not merely in name, they cannot be applied like a panacea"|FALSE
39064|"or put on like a suit of ready-made clothes. If alive, they grow with"|FALSE
39064|"individualised type out of the social situation: and they can only attain"|FALSE
39064|"a vulgar and visible universality, so far as they attach themselves to"|FALSE
39064|"some simple and uniform aspects,—a part tolerably identical everywhere—in"|FALSE
39064|"human nature in all times and races."|FALSE
39064|"Art, according to Hegel’s account, is the first of the three expressions"|FALSE
39064|"of Absolute Mind. But the key-note to the whole is to be found in"|FALSE
39064|"Religion(15): or Religion is the generic description of that phase of mind"|FALSE
39064|"which has found rest in the fullness of attainment and is no longer a"|FALSE
39064|"struggle and a warfare, but a fruition. “It is the conviction of all"|FALSE
39064|"nations,” he says(16), “that in the religious consciousness they hold"|FALSE
39064|"their truth; and they have always regarded religion as their dignity and"|FALSE
39064|"as the Sunday of their life. Whatever excites our doubts and alarms, all"|FALSE
39064|"grief and all anxiety, all that the petty fields of finitude can offer to"|FALSE
39064|"attract us, we leave behind on the shoals of time: and as the traveller on"|FALSE
39064|"the highest peak of a mountain range, removed from every distinct view of"|FALSE
39064|"the earth’s surface, quietly lets his vision neglect all the restrictions"|FALSE
39064|"of the landscape and the world; so in this pure region of faith man,"|FALSE
39064|"lifted above the hard and inflexible reality, sees it with his mind’s eye"|FALSE
39064|"reflected in the rays of the mental sun to an image where its discords,"|FALSE
39064|"its lights and shades, are softened to eternal calm. In this region of"|FALSE
39064|"mind flow the waters of forgetfulness, from which Psyche drinks, and in"|FALSE
39064|"which she drowns all her pain: and the darknesses of this life are here"|FALSE
39064|"softened to a dream-image, and transfigured into a mere setting for the"|FALSE
39064|"splendours of the Eternal.’”"|FALSE
39064|"If we take Religion, in this extended sense, we find it is the sense, the"|FALSE
39064|"vision, the faith, the certainty of the eternal in the changeable, of the"|FALSE
39064|"infinite in the finite, of the reality in appearance, of the truth in"|FALSE
39064|"error. It is freedom from the distractions and pre-occupations of the"|FALSE
39064|"particular details of life; it is the sense of permanence, repose,"|FALSE
39064|"certainty, rounding off, toning down and absorbing the vicissitude, the"|FALSE
39064|"restlessness, the doubts of actual life. Such a victory over palpable"|FALSE
39064|"reality has no doubt its origin—its embryology—in phases of mind which"|FALSE
39064|"have been already discussed in the first section. Religion will vary"|FALSE
39064|"enormously according to the grade of national mood of mind and social"|FALSE
39064|"development in which it emerges. But whatever be the peculiarities of its"|FALSE
39064|"original swaddling-clothes, its cardinal note will be a sense of"|FALSE
39064|"dependence on, and independence in, something more permanent, more august,"|FALSE
39064|"more of a surety and stay than visible and variable nature and"|FALSE
39064|"man,—something also which whether God or devil, or both in one, holds the"|FALSE
39064|"keys of life and death, of weal and woe, and holds them from some safe"|FALSE
39064|"vantage-ground above the lower realms of change. By this central being the"|FALSE
39064|"outward and the inward, past and present and to come, are made one. And as"|FALSE
39064|"already indicated, Religion, emerging, as it does, from social man, from"|FALSE
39064|"mind ethical, will retain traces of the two _foci_ in society: the"|FALSE
39064|"individual subjectivity and the objective community. Retain them however"|FALSE
39064|"only as traces, which still show in the actually envisaged reconciliation."|FALSE
39064|"For that is what religion does to morality. It carries a step higher the"|FALSE
39064|"unity or rather combination gained in the State: it is the fuller harmony"|FALSE
39064|"of the individual and the collectivity. The moral conscience rests in"|FALSE
39064|"certainty and fixity on the religious."|FALSE
39064|"But Religion (thus widely understood as the faith in sempiternal and"|FALSE
39064|"all-explaining reality) at first appears under a guise of Art. The poem"|FALSE
39064|"and the pyramid, the temple-image and the painting, the drama and the"|FALSE
39064|"fairy legend, these are religion: but they are, perhaps, religion as Art."|FALSE
39064|"And that means that they present the eternal under sensible"|FALSE
39064|"representations, the work of an artist, and in a perishable material of"|FALSE
39064|"limited range. Yet even the carvers of a long-past day whose works have"|FALSE
39064|"been disinterred from the plateaux of Auvergne knew that they gave to the"|FALSE
39064|"perishable life around them a quasi-immortality: and the myth-teller of a"|FALSE
39064|"savage tribe elevated the incident of a season into a perennial power of"|FALSE
39064|"love and fear. The cynic may remind us that from the finest picture of the"|FALSE
39064|"artist, readily"|FALSE
39064|"                              “We turn"|FALSE
39064|"    To yonder girl that fords the burn.”"|FALSE
39064|"And yet it may be said in reply to the cynic that, had it not been for the"|FALSE
39064|"deep-imprinted lesson of the artist, it would have been but a brutal"|FALSE
39064|"instinct that would have drawn our eyes. The artist, the poet, the"|FALSE
39064|"musician, reveal the meaning, the truth, the reality of the world: they"|FALSE
39064|"teach us, they help us, backward younger brothers, to see, to hear, to"|FALSE
39064|"feel what our rude senses had failed to detect. They enact the miracle of"|FALSE
39064|"the loaves and fishes, again and again: out of the common limited things"|FALSE
39064|"of every day they produce a bread of life in which the generations"|FALSE
39064|"continue to find nourishment."|FALSE
39064|"But if Art embodies for us the unseen and the eternal, it embodies it in"|FALSE
39064|"the stone, the colour, the tone, and the word: and these are by themselves"|FALSE
39064|"only dead matter. To the untutored eye and taste the finest"|FALSE
39064|"picture-gallery is only a weariness: when the national life has drifted"|FALSE
39064|"away, the sacred book and the image are but idols and enigmas. “The"|FALSE
39064|"statues are now corpses from which the vivifying soul has fled, and the"|FALSE
39064|"hymns are words whence faith has departed: the tables of the Gods are"|FALSE
39064|"without spiritual meat and drink, and games and feasts no longer afford"|FALSE
39064|"the mind its joyful union with the being of being. The works of the Muse"|FALSE
39064|"lack that intellectual force which knew itself strong and real by crushing"|FALSE
39064|"gods and men in its winepress. They are now (in this iron age) what they"|FALSE
39064|"are for us,—fair fruits broken from the tree, and handed to us by a kindly"|FALSE
39064|"destiny. But the gift is like the fruits which the girl in the picture"|FALSE
39064|"presents: she does not give the real life of their existence, not the tree"|FALSE
39064|"which bore them, not the earth and the elements which entered into their"|FALSE
39064|"substance, nor the climate which formed their quality, nor the change of"|FALSE
39064|"seasons which governed the process of their growth. Like her, Destiny in"|FALSE
39064|"giving us the works of ancient art does not give us their world, not the"|FALSE
39064|"spring and summer of the ethical life in which they blossomed and ripened,"|FALSE
39064|"but solely a memory and a suggestion of this actuality. Our act in"|FALSE
39064|"enjoying them, therefore, is not a Divine service: were it so, our mind"|FALSE
39064|"would achieve its perfect and satisfying truth. All that we do is a mere"|FALSE
39064|"externalism, which from these fruits wipes off some rain-drop, some speck"|FALSE
39064|"of dust, and which, in place of the inward elements of moral actuality"|FALSE
39064|"that created and inspired them, tries from the dead elements of their"|FALSE
39064|"external reality, such as language and historical allusion, to set up a"|FALSE
39064|"tedious mass of scaffolding, not in order to live ourselves into them, but"|FALSE
39064|"only to form a picture of them in our minds. But as the girl who proffers"|FALSE
39064|"the plucked fruits is more and nobler than the natural element with all"|FALSE
39064|"its details of tree, air, light, &c. which first yielded them, because she"|FALSE
39064|"gathers all this together, in a nobler way, into the glance of the"|FALSE
39064|"conscious eye and the gesture which proffers them; so the spirit of"|FALSE
39064|"destiny which offers us those works of art is more than the ethical life"|FALSE
39064|"and actuality of the ancient people: for it is the inwardising of that"|FALSE
39064|"mind which in them was still self-estranged and self-dispossessed:—it is"|FALSE
39064|"the spirit of tragic destiny, the destiny which collects all those"|FALSE
39064|"individualised gods and attributes of substance into the one Pantheon. And"|FALSE
39064|"that temple of all the gods is Mind conscious of itself as mind(17).”"|FALSE
39064|"Religion enters into its more adequate form when it ceases to appear in"|FALSE
39064|"the guise of Art and realises that the kingdom of God is within, that the"|FALSE
39064|"truth must be _felt_, the eternal _inwardly_ revealed, the holy one"|FALSE
39064|"apprehended by _faith_(18), not by outward vision. Eye hath not seen, nor"|FALSE
39064|"ear heard, the things of God. They cannot be presented, or delineated:"|FALSE
39064|"they come only in the witness of the spirit. The human soul itself is the"|FALSE
39064|"only worthy temple of the Most High, whom heaven, and the heaven of"|FALSE
39064|"heavens, cannot contain. Here in truth God has come down to dwell with"|FALSE
39064|"men; and the Son of Man, caught up in the effusion of the Spirit, can in"|FALSE
39064|"all assurance and all humility claim that he is divinified. Here"|FALSE
39064|"apparently Absolute Mind is reached: the soul knows no limitation, no"|FALSE
39064|"struggle: in time it is already eternal. Yet, there is, according to"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel, a flaw,—not in the essence and the matter, but in the manner and"|FALSE
39064|"mode in which the ordinary religious consciousness represents to itself,"|FALSE
39064|"or pictures that unification which it feels and experiences."|FALSE
39064|"“In religion then this unification of ultimate Being with the Self is"|FALSE
39064|"implicitly reached. But the religious consciousness, if it has this"|FALSE
39064|"symbolic idea of its reconciliation, still has it as a mere symbol or"|FALSE
39064|"representation. It attains the satisfaction by tacking on to its pure"|FALSE
39064|"negativity, and that externally, the positive signification of its unity"|FALSE
39064|"with the ultimate Being: its satisfaction remains therefore tainted by the"|FALSE
39064|"antithesis of another world. Its own reconciliation, therefore, is"|FALSE
39064|"presented to its consciousness as something far away, something far away"|FALSE
39064|"in the future: just as the reconciliation which the other Self"|FALSE
39064|"accomplished appears as a far-away thing in the past. The one Divine Man"|FALSE
39064|"had but an implicit father and only an actual mother; conversely the"|FALSE
39064|"universal divine man, the community, has its own deed and knowledge for"|FALSE
39064|"its father, but for its mother only the eternal Love, which it only"|FALSE
39064|"_feels_, but does not _behold_ in its consciousness as an actual immediate"|FALSE
39064|"object. Its reconciliation therefore is in its heart, but still at"|FALSE
39064|"variance with its consciousness, and its actuality still has a flaw. In"|FALSE
39064|"its field of consciousness the place of implicit reality or side of pure"|FALSE
39064|"mediation is taken by the reconciliation that lies far away behind: the"|FALSE
39064|"place of the actually present, or the side of immediacy and existence, is"|FALSE
39064|"filled by the world which has still to wait for its transfiguration to"|FALSE
39064|"glory. Implicitly no doubt the world is reconciled with the eternal Being;"|FALSE
39064|"and that Being, it is well known, no longer looks upon the object as alien"|FALSE
39064|"to it, but in its love sees it as like itself. But for self-consciousness"|FALSE
39064|"this immediate presence is not yet set in the full light of mind. In its"|FALSE
39064|"immediate consciousness accordingly the spirit of the community is parted"|FALSE
39064|"from its religious: for while the religious consciousness declares that"|FALSE
39064|"they are implicitly not parted, this implicitness is not raised to reality"|FALSE
39064|"and not yet grown to absolute self-certainty(19).”"|FALSE
39064|"Religion therefore, which as it first appeared in art-worship had yet to"|FALSE
39064|"realise its essential inwardness or spirituality, so has now to overcome"|FALSE
39064|"the antithesis in which its (the religious) consciousness stands to the"|FALSE
39064|"secular. For the peculiarly religious type of mind is distinguished by an"|FALSE
39064|"indifference and even hostility, more or less veiled, to art, to morality"|FALSE
39064|"and the civil state, to science and to nature. Strong in the certainty of"|FALSE
39064|"faith, or of its implicit rest in God, it resents too curious inquiry into"|FALSE
39064|"the central mystery of its union, and in its distincter consciousness sets"|FALSE
39064|"the foundation of faith on the evidence of a fact, which, however, it in"|FALSE
39064|"the same breath declares to be unique and miraculous, the central event of"|FALSE
39064|"the ages, pointing back in its reference to the first days of humanity,"|FALSE
39064|"and forward in the future to the winding-up of the business of terrestrial"|FALSE
39064|"life. Philosophy, according to Hegel’s conception of it, does but draw the"|FALSE
39064|"conclusion supplied by the premisses of religion: it supplements and"|FALSE
39064|"rounds off into coherence the religious implications. The unique events in"|FALSE
39064|"Judea nearly nineteen centuries ago are for it also the first step in a"|FALSE
39064|"new revelation of man’s relationship to God: but while it acknowledges the"|FALSE
39064|"transcendent interest of that age, it lays main stress on the permanent"|FALSE
39064|"truth then revealed, and it insists on the duty of carrying out the"|FALSE
39064|"principle there awakened to all the depth and breadth of its explication."|FALSE
39064|"Its task—its supreme task—is to _explicate religion_. But to do so is to"|FALSE
39064|"show that religion is no exotic, and no _mere_ revelation from an external"|FALSE
39064|"source. It is to show that religion is the truth, the complete reality, of"|FALSE
39064|"the mind that lived in Art, that founded the state and sought to be"|FALSE
39064|"dutiful and upright: the truth, the crowning fruit of all scientific"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge, of all human affections, of all secular consciousness. Its"|FALSE
39064|"lesson ultimately is that there is nothing essentially common or unclean:"|FALSE
39064|"that the holy is not parted off from the true and the good and the"|FALSE
39064|"beautiful."|FALSE
39064|"Religion thus expanded descends from its abstract or “intelligible” world,"|FALSE
39064|"to which it had retired from art and science, and the affairs of ordinary"|FALSE
39064|"life. Its God—as a true God—is not of the dead alone, but also of the"|FALSE
39064|"living: not a far-off supreme and ultimate Being, but also a man among"|FALSE
39064|"men. Philosophy thus has to break down the middle partition-wall of life,"|FALSE
39064|"the fence between secular and sacred. It is but religion come to its"|FALSE
39064|"maturity, made at home in the world, and no longer a stranger and a"|FALSE
39064|"wonder. Religion has pronounced in its inmost heart and faith of faith,"|FALSE
39064|"that the earth is the Lord’s, and that day unto day shows forth the divine"|FALSE
39064|"handiwork. But the heart of unbelief, of little faith, has hardly uttered"|FALSE
39064|"the word, than it forgets its assurance and leans to the conviction that"|FALSE
39064|"the prince of this world is the Spirit of Evil. The mood of Théodicée is"|FALSE
39064|"also—but with a difference—the mood of philosophy. It asserts the ways of"|FALSE
39064|"Providence: but its providence is not the God of the Moralist, or the"|FALSE
39064|"ideal of the Artist, or rather is not these only, but also the Law of"|FALSE
39064|"Nature, and more than that. Its aim is the Unity of History. The words"|FALSE
39064|"have sometimes been lightly used to mean that events run on in one"|FALSE
39064|"continuous flow, and that there are no abrupt, no ultimate beginnings,"|FALSE
39064|"parting age from age. But the Unity of History in its full sense is beyond"|FALSE
39064|"history: it is history “reduced” from the expanses of time to the eternal"|FALSE
39064|"present: its thousand years made one day,—made even the glance of a"|FALSE
39064|"moment. The theme of the Unity of History—in the full depth of unity and"|FALSE
39064|"the full expanse of history—is the theme of Hegelian philosophy. It traces"|FALSE
39064|"the process in which Mind has to be all-inclusive, self-upholding, one"|FALSE
39064|"with the Eternal reality."|FALSE
39064|"“That process of the mind’s self-realisation” says Hegel in the close of"|FALSE
39064|"his _Phenomenology_, “exhibits a lingering movement and succession of"|FALSE
39064|"minds, a gallery of images, each of which, equipped with the complete"|FALSE
39064|"wealth of mind, only seems to linger because the Self has to penetrate and"|FALSE
39064|"to digest this wealth of its Substance. As its perfection consists in"|FALSE
39064|"coming completely to _know_ what it _is_ (its substance), this knowledge"|FALSE
39064|"is its self-involution in which it deserts its outward existence and"|FALSE
39064|"surrenders its shape to recollection. Thus self-involved, it is sunk in"|FALSE
39064|"the night of its self-consciousness: but in that night its vanished being"|FALSE
39064|"is preserved, and that being, thus in idea preserved,—old, but now"|FALSE
39064|"new-born of the spirit,—is the new sphere of being, a new world, a new"|FALSE
39064|"phase of mind. In this new phase it has again to begin afresh and from the"|FALSE
39064|"beginning, and again nurture itself to maturity from its own resources, as"|FALSE
39064|"if for it all that preceded were lost, and it had learned nothing from the"|FALSE
39064|"experience of the earlier minds. Yet is that recollection a preservation"|FALSE
39064|"of experience: it is the quintessence, and in fact a higher form, of the"|FALSE
39064|"substance. If therefore this new mind appears only to count on its own"|FALSE
39064|"resources, and to start quite fresh and blank, it is at the same time on a"|FALSE
39064|"higher grade that it starts. The intellectual and spiritual realm, which"|FALSE
39064|"is thus constructed in actuality, forms a succession in time, where one"|FALSE
39064|"mind relieved another of its watch, and each took over the kingdom of the"|FALSE
39064|"world from the preceding. The purpose of that succession is to reveal the"|FALSE
39064|"depth, and that depth is the absolute comprehension of mind: this"|FALSE
39064|"revelation is therefore to uplift its depth, to spread it out in breadth,"|FALSE
39064|"so negativing this self-involved Ego, wherein it is self-dispossessed or"|FALSE
39064|"reduced to substance. But it is also its time: the course of time shows"|FALSE
39064|"this dispossession itself dispossessed, and thus in its extension it is no"|FALSE
39064|"less in its depth, the self. The way to that goal,—absolute"|FALSE
39064|"self-certainty—or the mind knowing itself as mind—is the inwardising of"|FALSE
39064|"the minds, as they severally are in themselves, and as they accomplish the"|FALSE
39064|"organisation of their realm. Their conservation,—regarded on the side of"|FALSE
39064|"its free and apparently contingent succession of fact—is history: on the"|FALSE
39064|"side of their comprehended organisation, again, it is the science of"|FALSE
39064|"mental phenomenology: the two together, comprehended history, form at once"|FALSE
39064|"the recollection and the grave-yard of the absolute Mind, the actuality,"|FALSE
39064|"truth, and certitude of his throne, apart from which he were lifeless and"|FALSE
39064|"alone.”"|FALSE
39064|"Such in brief outline—lingering most on the points where Hegel has here"|FALSE
39064|"been briefest—is the range of the Philosophy of Mind. Its aim is to"|FALSE
39064|"comprehend, not to explain: to put together in intelligent unity, not to"|FALSE
39064|"analyse into a series of elements. For it psychology is not an analysis or"|FALSE
39064|"description of mental phenomena, of laws of association, of the growth of"|FALSE
39064|"certain powers and ideas, but a “comprehended history” of the formation of"|FALSE
39064|"subjective mind, of the intelligent, feeling, willing self or ego. For it"|FALSE
39064|"Ethics is part and only part of the great scheme or system of"|FALSE
39064|"self-development; but continuing into greater concreteness the normal"|FALSE
39064|"endowment of the individual mind, and but preparing the ground on which"|FALSE
39064|"religion may be most effectively cultivated. And finally Religion itself,"|FALSE
39064|"released from its isolation and other-world sacrosanctity, is shown to be"|FALSE
39064|"only the crown of life, the ripest growth of actuality, and shown to be so"|FALSE
39064|"by philosophy, whilst it is made clear that religion is the basis of"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy, or that a philosophy can only go as far as the religious"|FALSE
39064|"stand-point allows. The hierarchy, if so it be called, of the spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"forces is one where none can stand alone, or claim an abstract and"|FALSE
39064|"independent supremacy. The truth of egoism is the truth of altruism: the"|FALSE
39064|"truly moral is the truly religious: and each is not what it professes to"|FALSE
39064|"be unless it anticipate the later, or include the earlier."|FALSE
39064|"(iv.) Mind or Spirit."|FALSE
39064|"It may be said, however, that for such a range of subjects the term Mind"|FALSE
39064|"is wretchedly inadequate and common-place, and that the better rendering"|FALSE
39064|"of the title would be Philosophy of Spirit. It may be admitted that Mind"|FALSE
39064|"is not all that could be wished. But neither is Spirit blameless. And, it"|FALSE
39064|"may be added, Hegel’s own term _Geist_ has to be unduly strained to cover"|FALSE
39064|"so wide a region. It serves—and was no doubt meant to serve—as a sign of"|FALSE
39064|"the conformity of his system with the religion which sees in God no"|FALSE
39064|"other-world being, but our very self and mind, and which worships him in"|FALSE
39064|"spirit and in truth. And if the use of a word like this could allay the"|FALSE
39064|"“ancient variance” between the religious and the philosophic mood, it"|FALSE
39064|"would be but churlish perhaps to refuse the sign of compliance and"|FALSE
39064|"compromise. But whatever may be the case in German,—and even there the new"|FALSE
39064|"wine was dangerous to the old wine-skin—it is certain that to average"|FALSE
39064|"English ears the word Spiritual would carry us over the medium line into"|FALSE
39064|"the proper land of religiosity. And to do that, as we have seen, is to sin"|FALSE
39064|"against the central idea: the idea that religion is of one blood with the"|FALSE
39064|"whole mental family, though the most graciously complete of all the"|FALSE
39064|"sisters. Yet, however the word may be chosen, the philosophy of Hegel,"|FALSE
39064|"like the august lady who appeared in vision to the emprisoned Boëthius,"|FALSE
39064|"has on her garment a sign which “signifies the life which is on earth,” as"|FALSE
39064|"also a sign which signifies the “right law of heaven”; if her right-hand"|FALSE
39064|"holds the “book of the justice of the King omnipotent,” the sceptre in her"|FALSE
39064|"left is “corporal judgment against sin(20).”"|FALSE
39064|"There is indeed no sufficient reason for contemning the term Mind. If"|FALSE
39064|"Inductive Philosophy of the Human Mind has—perhaps to a dainty taste—made"|FALSE
39064|"the word unsavoury, that is no reason for refusing to give it all the"|FALSE
39064|"wealth of soul and heart, of intellect and will. The _mens aeterna_ which,"|FALSE
39064|"if we hear Tacitus, expressed the Hebrew conception of the spirituality of"|FALSE
39064|"God, and the Νοῦς which Aristotelianism set supreme in the Soul, are not"|FALSE
39064|"the mere or abstract intelligence, which late-acquired habits of"|FALSE
39064|"abstraction have made out of them. If the reader will adopt the term (in"|FALSE
39064|"want of a better) in its widest scope, we may shelter ourselves under the"|FALSE
39064|"example of Wordsworth. His theme is—as he describes it in the"|FALSE
39064|"_Recluse_—“the Mind and Man”: his"|FALSE
39064|"                        “voice proclaims"|FALSE

39064|"sichere Gang der Wissenschaft_. To assert this is not, of course, to throw"|FALSE
39064|"any doubts on the importance of the problems, or on the intrinsic value of"|FALSE
39064|"the results, in the studies which have been prosecuted under that name. It"|FALSE
39064|"is only to note the obvious fact that a number of inquiries of somewhat"|FALSE
39064|"discrepant tone, method, and tendency have all at different times covered"|FALSE
39064|"themselves under the common title of psychological, and that the work of"|FALSE
39064|"orientation is as yet incomplete. Such a destiny seems inevitable, when a"|FALSE
39064|"name is coined rather as the title of an unexplored territory, than fixed"|FALSE
39064|"on to describe an accomplished fact."|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Psychology as a Science and as a Part of Philosophy."|FALSE
39064|"The _De Anima_ of Aristotle, gathering up into one the work of Plato and"|FALSE
39064|"his predecessors, may be said to lay the foundation of psychology. But"|FALSE
39064|"even in it, we can already see that there are two elements or aspects"|FALSE
39064|"struggling for mastery: two elements not unrelated or independent, but"|FALSE
39064|"hard to keep fairly and fully in unity. On one hand there is the"|FALSE
39064|"conception of Soul as a part of Nature, as a grade of existence in the"|FALSE
39064|"physical or natural universe,—in the universe of things which suffer"|FALSE
39064|"growth and change, which are never entirely “without matter,” and are"|FALSE
39064|"always attached to or present in body. From this point of view Aristotle"|FALSE
39064|"urged that a sound and realistic psychology must, e.g. in its definition"|FALSE
39064|"of a passion, give the prominent place to its physical (or material)"|FALSE
39064|"expression, and not to its mental form or significance. It must remember,"|FALSE
39064|"he said, that the phenomena or “accidents” are what really throw light on"|FALSE
39064|"the nature or the “substance” of the Soul. On the other hand, there are"|FALSE
39064|"two points to be considered. There is, first of all, the counterpoising"|FALSE
39064|"remark that the conception of Soul as such, as a unity and common"|FALSE
39064|"characteristic, will be determinative of the phenomena or"|FALSE
39064|"“accidents,”—will settle, as it were, what we are to observe and look for,"|FALSE
39064|"and how we are to describe our observations. And by the _conception_ of"|FALSE
39064|"Soul, is meant not _a_ soul, as a thing or agent (subject) which has"|FALSE
39064|"properties attaching to it; but soul, as the generic feature, the"|FALSE
39064|"universal, which is set as a stamp on everything that claims to be"|FALSE
39064|"psychical. In other words, Soul is one, not as a single thing contrasted"|FALSE
39064|"with its attributes, activities, or exercises of force (such single thing"|FALSE
39064|"will be shown by logic to be a metaphysical fiction); but as the unity of"|FALSE
39064|"form and character, the comprehensive and identical feature, which is"|FALSE
39064|"present in all its manifestations and exercises. But there is a second"|FALSE
39064|"consideration. The question is asked by Aristotle whether it is completely"|FALSE
39064|"and strictly accurate to put Soul under the category of natural objects."|FALSE
39064|"There is in it, or of it, perhaps, something, and something essential to"|FALSE
39064|"it, which belongs to the order of the eternal and self-active: something"|FALSE
39064|"which is “form” and “energy” quite unaffected by and separate from"|FALSE
39064|"“matter.” How this is related to the realm of the perishable and"|FALSE
39064|"changeable is a problem on which Aristotle has been often (and with some"|FALSE
39064|"reason) believed to be obscure, if not even inconsistent(21)."|FALSE
39064|"In these divergent elements which come to the fore in Aristotle’s"|FALSE
39064|"treatment we have the appearance of a radical difference of conception and"|FALSE
39064|"purpose as to psychology. He himself does a good deal to keep them both in"|FALSE
39064|"view. But it is evident that here already we have the contrast between a"|FALSE
39064|"purely physical or (in the narrower sense) “scientific” psychology,"|FALSE
39064|"empirical and realistic in treatment, and a more philosophical—what in"|FALSE
39064|"certain quarters would be called a speculative or metaphysical—conception"|FALSE
39064|"of the problem. There is also in Aristotle the antithesis of a popular or"|FALSE
39064|"superficial, and an accurate or analytic, psychology. The former is of a"|FALSE
39064|"certain use in dealing, say, with questions of practical ethics and"|FALSE
39064|"education: the latter is of more strictly scientific interest. Both of"|FALSE
39064|"these distinctions—that between a speculative and an empirical, and that"|FALSE
39064|"between a scientific and a popular treatment—affect the subsequent history"|FALSE
39064|"of the study. Psychology is sometimes understood to mean the results of"|FALSE
39064|"casual observation of our own minds by what is termed introspection, and"|FALSE
39064|"by the interpretation of what we may observe in others. Such observations"|FALSE
39064|"are in the first place carried on under the guidance of distinctions or"|FALSE
39064|"points of view supplied by the names in common use. We interrogate our own"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness as to what facts or relations of facts correspond to the"|FALSE
39064|"terms of our national language. Or we attempt—what is really an"|FALSE
39064|"inexhaustible quest—to get definite divisions between them, and clear-cut"|FALSE
39064|"definitions. Inquiries like these which start from popular distinctions"|FALSE
39064|"fall a long way short of science: and the inquirer will find that"|FALSE
39064|"accidental and essential properties are given in the same handful of"|FALSE
39064|"conclusions. Yet there is always much value in these attempts to get our"|FALSE
39064|"minds cleared: and it is indispensable for all inquiries that all alleged"|FALSE
39064|"or reported facts of mind should be realised and reproduced in our own"|FALSE
39064|"mental experience. And this is especially the case in psychology, just"|FALSE
39064|"because here we cannot get the object outside us, we cannot get or make a"|FALSE
39064|"diagram, and unless we give it reality by re-constructing it,—by"|FALSE
39064|"re-interrogating our own experience, our knowledge of it will be but"|FALSE
39064|"wooden and mechanical. And the term introspection need not be too"|FALSE
39064|"seriously taken: it means much more than watching passively an internal"|FALSE
39064|"drama; and is quite as well describable as mental projection, setting out"|FALSE
39064|"what was within, and so as it were hidden and involved, before ourselves"|FALSE
39064|"in the field of mental vision. Here, as always, the essential point is to"|FALSE
39064|"get ourselves well out of the way of the object observed, and to stand,"|FALSE
39064|"figuratively speaking, quite on one side."|FALSE
39064|"But even at the best, such a popular or empirical psychology has no"|FALSE
39064|"special claim to be ranked as science. It may no doubt be said that at"|FALSE
39064|"least it collects, describes, or notes down facts. But even this is not so"|FALSE
39064|"certain as it seems. Its so-called facts are very largely fictions, or so"|FALSE
39064|"largely interpolated with error, that they cannot be safely used for"|FALSE
39064|"construction. If psychology is to accomplish anything valuable, it must go"|FALSE
39064|"more radically to work. It must—at least in a measure—discard from its"|FALSE
39064|"preliminary view the data of common and current distinctions, and try to"|FALSE
39064|"get at something more primary or ultimate as its starting-point. And this"|FALSE
39064|"it may do in two ways. It may, in the one case, follow the example of the"|FALSE
39064|"physical sciences. In these it is the universal practice to assume that"|FALSE
39064|"the explanation of complex and concrete facts is to be attained by (_a_)"|FALSE
39064|"postulating certain simple elements (which we may call atoms, molecules,"|FALSE
39064|"and perhaps units or monads), which are supposed to be clearly conceivable"|FALSE
39064|"and to justify themselves by intrinsic intelligibility, and by (_b_)"|FALSE
39064|"assuming that these elements are compounded and combined according to laws"|FALSE
39064|"which again are in the last resort self-evident, or such that they seem to"|FALSE
39064|"have an obvious and palpable lucidity. Further, such laws being always"|FALSE
39064|"axioms or plain postulates of mechanics (for these alone possess this"|FALSE
39064|"feature of self-evident intelligibility), they are subject to and invite"|FALSE
39064|"all the aids and refinements of the higher mathematical calculus. What the"|FALSE
39064|"primary and self-explicative bits of psychical reality may be, is a"|FALSE
39064|"further question on which there may be some dispute. They may be, so to"|FALSE
39064|"say, taken in a more physical or in a more metaphysical way: i.e. more as"|FALSE
39064|"units of nerve-function or more as elements of ideative-function. And"|FALSE
39064|"there may be differences as to how far and in what provinces the"|FALSE
39064|"mathematical calculus may be applicable. But, in any case, there will be a"|FALSE
39064|"strong tendency in psychology, worked on this plan, to follow, _mutatis"|FALSE
39064|"mutandis_, and at some distance perhaps, the analogy of material physics."|FALSE
39064|"In both the justification of the postulated units and laws will be their"|FALSE
39064|"ability to describe and systematise the observed phenomena in a uniform"|FALSE
39064|"and consistent way."|FALSE
39064|"The other way in which psychology gets a foundation and ulterior certainty"|FALSE
39064|"is different, and goes deeper. After all, the “scientific” method is only"|FALSE
39064|"a way in which the facts of a given sphere are presented in thoroughgoing"|FALSE
39064|"interconnexion, each reduced to an exact multiple or fraction of some"|FALSE
39064|"other, by an inimitably continued subtraction and addition of an assumed"|FALSE
39064|"homogeneous element, found or assumed to be perfectly imaginable"|FALSE
39064|"(conceivable). But we may also consider the province in relation to the"|FALSE
39064|"whole sphere of reality, may ask what is its place and meaning in the"|FALSE
39064|"whole, what reality is in the end driving at or coming to be, and how far"|FALSE
39064|"this special province contributes to that end. If we do this, we attach"|FALSE
39064|"psychology to philosophy, or, if we prefer so to call it, to metaphysics,"|FALSE
39064|"as in the former way we established it on the principles generally"|FALSE
39064|"received as governing the method of the physical sciences."|FALSE
39064|"This—the relation of psychology to fundamental philosophy—is a question"|FALSE
39064|"which also turns up in dealing with Ethics. There is on the part of those"|FALSE
39064|"engaged in either of these inquiries a certain impatience against the"|FALSE
39064|"intermeddling (which is held to be only muddling) of metaphysics with"|FALSE
39064|"them. It is clear that in a very decided way both psychology and ethics"|FALSE
39064|"can, up to some extent at least, be treated as what is called empirical"|FALSE
39064|"(or, to use the more English phrase, inductive) sciences. On many hands"|FALSE
39064|"they are actually so treated: and not without result. Considering the"|FALSE
39064|"tendency of metaphysical inquiries, it may be urged that it is well to"|FALSE
39064|"avoid preliminary criticism of the current conceptions and beliefs about"|FALSE
39064|"reality which these sciences imply. Yet such beliefs are undoubtedly"|FALSE
39064|"present and effective. Schopenhauer has popularised the principle that the"|FALSE
39064|"pure empiricist is a fiction, that man is a radically metaphysical animal,"|FALSE
39064|"and that he inevitably turns what he receives into a part of a dogmatic"|FALSE
39064|"creed—a conviction how things ought to be. Almost without effort there"|FALSE
39064|"grows up in him, or flows in upon him, a belief and a system of beliefs as"|FALSE
39064|"to the order and values of things. Every judgment, even in logic, rests on"|FALSE
39064|"such an order of truth. He need not be able to formulate his creed: it"|FALSE
39064|"will influence him none the less: nay, his faith will probably seem more a"|FALSE
39064|"part of the solid earth and common reality, the less it has been reduced"|FALSE
39064|"to a determinate creed or to a code of principles. For such formulation"|FALSE
39064|"presupposes doubt and scepticism, which it beats back by mere assertion."|FALSE
39064|"Each human being has such a background of convictions which govern his"|FALSE
39064|"actions and conceptions, and of which it so startles him to suggest the"|FALSE
39064|"possibility of a doubt, that he turns away in dogmatic horror. Such ruling"|FALSE
39064|"ideas vary, from man to man, and from man to woman—if we consider them in"|FALSE
39064|"all their minuteness. But above all they constitute themselves in a"|FALSE
39064|"differently organised system or aggregate according to the social and"|FALSE
39064|"educational stratum to which an individual belongs. Each group, engaged in"|FALSE
39064|"a common task, it may be in the study of a part of nature, is ideally"|FALSE
39064|"bound and obliged by a common language, and special standards of truth and"|FALSE
39064|"reality for its own. Such a group of ideas is what Bacon would have called"|FALSE
39064|"a scientific fetich or _idolum theatri_. A scientific _idolum_ is a"|FALSE
39064|"traditional belief or dogma as to principles, values, and methods, which"|FALSE
39064|"has so thoroughly pervaded the minds of those engaged in a branch of"|FALSE
39064|"inquiry, that they no longer recognise its hypothetical character,—its"|FALSE
39064|"relation of means to the main end of their function."|FALSE
39064|"Such a collected and united theory of reality (it is what Hegel has"|FALSE
39064|"designated the Idea) is what is understood by a natural metaphysic. It has"|FALSE
39064|"nothing necessarily to do with a supersensible or a supernatural, if these"|FALSE
39064|"words mean a ghostly, materialised, but super-finely-materialised nature,"|FALSE
39064|"above and beyond the present. But that there is a persistent tendency to"|FALSE
39064|"conceive the unity and coherence, the theoretic idea of reality, in this"|FALSE
39064|"pseudo-sensuous (i.e. super-sensuous) form, is of course a well-known"|FALSE
39064|"fact. For the present, however, this aberration—this idol of the tribe—may"|FALSE
39064|"be left out of sight. By a metaphysic or fundamental philosophy, is, in"|FALSE
39064|"the present instance, meant a system of first principles—a secular and"|FALSE
39064|"cosmic creed: a belief in ends and values, a belief in truth—again"|FALSE
39064|"premising that the system in question is, for most, a rudely organised and"|FALSE
39064|"almost inarticulate mass of belief and hope, conviction and impression. It"|FALSE
39064|"is, in short, a _natural_ metaphysic: a metaphysic, that is, which has but"|FALSE
39064|"an imperfect coherence, which imperfectly realises both its nature and its"|FALSE
39064|"limits."|FALSE
39064|"In certain parts, however, it is more and better than this crude"|FALSE
39064|"background of belief. Each science—or at least every group of sciences—has"|FALSE
39064|"a more definite system or aggregate of first principles, axioms, and"|FALSE

39064|"hardly conscious that these are principles and concepts: on the contrary,"|FALSE
39064|"they will be supposed self-evident and ultimate facts, foundations of"|FALSE
39064|"being. Instead of being treated as modes of conception, more or less"|FALSE
39064|"justified by their use and their results, these categories will be"|FALSE
39064|"regarded as fundamental facts, essential conditions of all reality. Like"|FALSE
39064|"popular thought in its ingrained categories, the specialist cannot"|FALSE
39064|"understand the possibility of any limitation to his radical ideas of"|FALSE
39064|"reality. To him they are not hypotheses, but principles. The scientific"|FALSE
39064|"specialist may be as convinced of the universal application of his"|FALSE

39064|"Under such metaphysical or extra-empirical presuppositions all"|FALSE
39064|"investigation, whether it be crudely empirical or (in the physical sense)"|FALSE
39064|"scientific, is carried on. And when so carried on, it is said to be"|FALSE
39064|"prosecuted apart from any interference from metaphysic. Such a naïve or"|FALSE
39064|"natural metaphysic, not raised to explicit consciousness, not followed as"|FALSE
39064|"an imposed rule, but governing with the strength of an immanent faith,"|FALSE
39064|"does not count for those who live under it as a metaphysic at all. M."|FALSE
39064|"Jourdain was amazed suddenly to learn he had been speaking prose for forty"|FALSE

39064|"than amazement sure to be excited by the news. For the critic who thus"|FALSE
39064|"reveals the secrets of the scientist’s heart is pretty sure to go on to"|FALSE
39064|"say that a good deal of this naïve unconscious metaphysic is incoherent,"|FALSE
39064|"contradictory, even bad: that it requires correction, revision, and"|FALSE
39064|"readjustment, and has by criticism to be made one and harmonious. That"|FALSE
39064|"readjustment or criticism which shall eliminate contradiction and produce"|FALSE
39064|"unity, is the aim of the _science_ of metaphysic—the science of the"|FALSE
39064|"meta-physical element in physical knowledge: what Hegel has chosen to call"|FALSE
39064|"the Science of Logic (in the wide sense of the term). This higher Logic,"|FALSE
39064|"this _science_ of metaphysic, is the process to revise and harmonise in"|FALSE
39064|"systematic completeness the imperfect or misleading and partial estimates"|FALSE
39064|"of reality which are to be found in popular and scientific thought."|FALSE
39064|"In the case of the run of physical sciences this revision is less"|FALSE
39064|"necessary; and for no very recondite reason. Every science by its very"|FALSE
39064|"nature deals with a special, a limited topic. It is confined to a part or"|FALSE
39064|"aspect of reality. Its propositions are not complete truths; they apply to"|FALSE
39064|"an artificial world, to a part expressly cut off from the concrete"|FALSE
39064|"reality. Its principles are generally cut according to their"|FALSE
39064|"cloth,—according to the range in which they apply. The only danger that"|FALSE
39064|"can well arise is if these categories are transplanted without due"|FALSE
39064|"reservations, and made of universal application, i.e. if the scientist"|FALSE
39064|"elects on his speciality to pronounce _de omnibus rebus_. But in the case"|FALSE
39064|"of psychology and ethics the harmlessness of natural metaphysics will be"|FALSE
39064|"less certain. Here a general human or universal interest is almost an"|FALSE
39064|"inevitable coefficient: especially if they really rise to the full sweep"|FALSE
39064|"of the subject. For as such they both seem to deal not with a part of"|FALSE
39064|"reality, but with the very centre and purpose of all reality. In them we"|FALSE
39064|"are not dealing with topics of secondary interest, but with the very heart"|FALSE
39064|"of the human problem. Here the questions of reality and ideals, of unity"|FALSE
39064|"and diversity, and of the evaluation of existence, come distinctly to the"|FALSE
39064|"fore. If psychology is to answer the question, What am I? and ethics the"|FALSE

39064|"The German thinker, who has given perhaps the most fruitful stimulus to"|FALSE
39064|"the scientific study of psychology in modern times—Johann Friedrich"|FALSE
39064|"Herbart—is after all essentially a philosopher, and not a mere scientist,"|FALSE
39064|"even in his psychology. His psychological inquiry, that is, stands in"|FALSE
39064|"intimate connexion with the last questions of all intelligence, with"|FALSE
39064|"metaphysics and ethics. The business of philosophy, says Herbart, is to"|FALSE
39064|"touch up and finish off conceptions (_Bearbeitung der Begriffe_)(22). It"|FALSE
39064|"finds, as it supervenes upon the unphilosophical world, that mere and pure"|FALSE
39064|"facts (if there ever are or were such purisms) have been enveloped in a"|FALSE
39064|"cloud of theory, have been construed into some form of unity, but have"|FALSE
39064|"been imperfectly, inadequately construed: and that the existing concepts"|FALSE
39064|"in current use need to be corrected, supplemented and readjusted. It has,"|FALSE
39064|"accordingly, for its work to “reconcile experience with itself(23),” and"|FALSE
39064|"to elicit “the hidden pre-suppositions without which the fact of"|FALSE
39064|"experience is unthinkable.” Psychology, then, as a branch of this"|FALSE
39064|"philosophic enterprise, has to readjust the facts discovered in inner"|FALSE
39064|"experience. For mere uncritical experience or merely empirical knowledge"|FALSE
39064|"only offers _problems_; it suggests gaps, which indeed further reflection"|FALSE
39064|"serves at first only to deepen into contradictions. Such a psychology is"|FALSE
39064|"“speculative”: i.e. it is not content to accept the mere given, but goes"|FALSE
39064|"forward and backward to find something that will make the fact"|FALSE
39064|"intelligible. It employs totally different methods from the"|FALSE
39064|"“classification, induction, analogy” familiar to the logic of the"|FALSE
39064|"empirical sciences. Its “principles,” therefore, are not given facts: but"|FALSE
39064|"facts which have been manipulated and adjusted so as to lose their"|FALSE
39064|"self-contradictory quality: they are facts “reduced,” by introducing the"|FALSE
39064|"omitted relationships which they postulate if they are to be true and"|FALSE
39064|"self-consistent(24). While it is far from rejecting or ignoring"|FALSE
39064|"experience, therefore, psychology cannot strictly be said to build upon it"|FALSE
39064|"alone. It uses experimental fact as an unfinished datum,—or it sees in"|FALSE
39064|"experience a torso which betrays its imperfection, and suggests"|FALSE
39064|"completing."|FALSE
39064|"The starting-point, it may be said, of Herbart’s psychology is a question"|FALSE
39064|"which to the ordinary psychologist (and to the so-called scientific"|FALSE
39064|"psychologist) has a secondary, if it have any interest. It was, he says,"|FALSE
39064|"the problem of Personality, the problem of the Self or Ego, which first"|FALSE
39064|"led to his characteristic conception of psychological method. “My first"|FALSE
39064|"discovery,” he tells us(25), “was that the Self was neither primitive nor"|FALSE
39064|"independent, but must be the most dependent and most conditioned thing one"|FALSE
39064|"can imagine. The second was that the elementary ideas of an intelligent"|FALSE
39064|"being, if they were ever to reach the pitch of self-consciousness, must be"|FALSE
39064|"either all, or at least in part, opposed to each other, and that they must"|FALSE
39064|"check or block one another in consequence of this opposition. Though held"|FALSE
39064|"in check, however, these ideas were not to be supposed lost: they subsist"|FALSE
39064|"as endeavours or tendencies to return into the position of actual idea, as"|FALSE
39064|"soon as the check became, for any reason, either in whole or in part"|FALSE
39064|"inoperative. This check could and must be calculated, and thus it was"|FALSE
39064|"clear that psychology required a mathematical as well as a metaphysical"|FALSE
39064|"foundation.”"|FALSE
39064|"The place of the conception of the Ego in Kant’s and Fichte’s theory of"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge is well known. Equally well known is Kant’s treatment of the"|FALSE
39064|"soul-reality or soul-substance in his examination of Rational Psychology."|FALSE
39064|"Whereas the (logical) unity of consciousness, or “synthetic unity of"|FALSE
39064|"apperception,” is assumed as a fundamental starting-point in explanation"|FALSE
39064|"of our objective judgments, or of our knowledge of objective existence,"|FALSE
39064|"its real (as opposed to its formal) foundation in a “substantial” soul is"|FALSE
39064|"set aside as an illegitimate interpretation of, or inference from, the"|FALSE
39064|"facts of inner experience. The belief in the separate unity and"|FALSE
39064|"persistence of the soul, said Kant, is not a scientifically-warranted"|FALSE
39064|"conclusion. Its true place is as an ineffaceable postulate of the faith"|FALSE
39064|"which inspires human life and action. Herbart did not rest content with"|FALSE
39064|"either of these—as he believed—dogmatic assumptions of his master. He did"|FALSE
39064|"not fall in cheerfully with the idealism which seemed ready to dispense"|FALSE
39064|"with a soul, or which justified its acceptance of empirical reality by"|FALSE
39064|"referring to the fundamental unity of the function of judgment. With a"|FALSE
39064|"strong bent towards fully-differentiated and individualised experience"|FALSE
39064|"Herbart conjoined a conviction of the need of logical analysis to prevent"|FALSE
39064|"us being carried away by the first-come and inadequate generalities. The"|FALSE
39064|"Ego which, in its extremest abstraction, he found defined as the unity of"|FALSE
39064|"subject and object, did not seem to him to offer the proper guarantees of"|FALSE
39064|"reality: it was itself a problem, full of contradictions, waiting for"|FALSE
39064|"solution. On the other hand, the real Ego, or self of concrete experience,"|FALSE
39064|"is very much more than this logical abstract, and differs widely from"|FALSE
39064|"individual to individual, and apparently from time to time even in the"|FALSE
39064|"same individual. Our self, of which we talk so fluently, as one and the"|FALSE
39064|"self-same—how far does it really possess the continuity and identity with"|FALSE
39064|"which we credit it? Does it not rather seem to be an ideal which we"|FALSE
39064|"gradually form and set before ourselves as the standard for measuring our"|FALSE
39064|"attainments of the moment,—the perfect fulfilment of that oneness of being"|FALSE
39064|"and purpose and knowledge which we never reach? Sometimes even it seems no"|FALSE
39064|"better than a name which we move along the varying phenomena of our inner"|FALSE
39064|"life, at one time identifying it with the power which has gained the"|FALSE
39064|"victory in a moral struggle, at another with that which has been"|FALSE
39064|"defeated(26), according as the attitude of the moment makes us throw now"|FALSE
39064|"one, now another, aspect of mental activity in the foreground."|FALSE
39064|"The other—or logical Ego—the mere identity of subject and object,—when"|FALSE
39064|"taken in its utter abstractness and simplicity, shrivels up to something"|FALSE
39064|"very small indeed—to a something which is little better than nothing. The"|FALSE
39064|"mere _I_ which is not contra-distinguished by a _Thou_ and a _He_—which is"|FALSE
39064|"without all definiteness of predication (the I=I of Fichte and"|FALSE
39064|"Schelling)—is only as it were a point of being cut off from all its"|FALSE
39064|"connexions in reality, and treated as if it were or could be entirely"|FALSE
39064|"independent. It is an identity in which subject and object have not yet"|FALSE
39064|"appeared: it is not a real I, though we may still retain the name. It"|FALSE
39064|"is—as Hegel’s _Logic_ will tell us—exactly definable as Being, which is as"|FALSE
39064|"yet Nothing: the impossible edge of abstraction on which we try—and in"|FALSE
39064|"vain—to steady ourselves at the initial point of thought. And to reach or"|FALSE
39064|"stand at that intangible, ungraspable point, which slips away as we"|FALSE
39064|"approach, and transmutes itself as we hold it, is not the natural"|FALSE
39064|"beginning, but the result of introspection and reflection on the concrete"|FALSE
39064|"self. But with this aspect of the question we are not now concerned."|FALSE
39064|"That the unity of the Self as an intelligent and moral being, that the Ego"|FALSE
39064|"of self-consciousness was an ideal and a product of development, was what"|FALSE
39064|"Herbart soon became convinced of. The unity of Self is even as given in"|FALSE
39064|"mature experience an imperfect fact. It is a fact, that is, which does not"|FALSE
39064|"come up to what it promised, and which requires to be supplemented, or"|FALSE
39064|"philosophically justified. Here and everywhere the custom of life carries"|FALSE
39064|"us over gaps which yawn deep to the eye of philosophic reflection: even"|FALSE
39064|"though accident and illness force them not unfrequently even upon the"|FALSE
39064|"blindest. To trace the process of unification towards this unity—to trace,"|FALSE
39064|"if you like, even the formation of the concept of such unity, as a"|FALSE
39064|"governing and guiding principle in life and conduct, comes to be the"|FALSE
39064|"problem of the psychologist, in the largest sense of that problem. From"|FALSE
39064|"Soul (_Seele_) to Mind or Spirit (_Geist_) is for Herbart, as for Hegel,"|FALSE
39064|"the course of psychology(27). The growth and development of mind, the"|FALSE
39064|"formation of a self, the realisation of a personality, is for both the"|FALSE
39064|"theme which psychology has to expound. And Herbart, not less than Hegel,"|FALSE
39064|"had to bear the censure that such a conception of mental reality as a"|FALSE
39064|"growth would destroy personality(28)."|FALSE
39064|"But with so much common in the general plan, the two thinkers differ"|FALSE
39064|"profoundly in their special mode of carrying out the task. Or, rather,"|FALSE
39064|"they turn their strength on different departments of the whole. Herbart’s"|FALSE
39064|"great practical interest had been the theory of education: “paedagogic” is"|FALSE
39064|"the subject of his first important writings. The inner history of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas—the processes which are based on the interaction of elements in the"|FALSE
39064|"individual soul—are what he specially traces. Hegel’s interests, on the"|FALSE
39064|"contrary, are more towards the greater process, the unities of historical"|FALSE
39064|"life, and the correlations of the powers of art, religion, and philosophy"|FALSE
39064|"that work therein. He turns to the macrocosm, almost as naturally as"|FALSE
39064|"Herbart does to the microcosm. Thus, even in Ethics, while Herbart gives a"|FALSE
39064|"delicate analysis of the distinct aspects or elements in the Ethical"|FALSE
39064|"idea,—the diverse headings under which the disinterested spectator within"|FALSE
39064|"the breast measures with purely aesthetic eye his approach to unity and"|FALSE
39064|"strength of purpose, Hegel seems to hurry away from the field of moral"|FALSE
39064|"sense or conscience to throw himself on the social and political"|FALSE
39064|"organisation of the moral life. The General Paedagogic of Herbart has its"|FALSE
39064|"pendant in Hegel’s Philosophy of Law and of History."|FALSE
39064|"At an early period Herbart had become impressed with the necessity of"|FALSE
39064|"applying mathematics to psychology(29). To the usual objection, that"|FALSE
39064|"psychical facts do not admit of measurement, he had a ready reply. We can"|FALSE
39064|"calculate even on hypothetical assumptions: indeed, could we measure, we"|FALSE
39064|"should scarcely take the trouble to calculate(30). To calculate (i.e. to"|FALSE
39064|"deduce mathematically) is to perform a general experiment, and to perform"|FALSE
39064|"it in the medium where there is least likelihood of error or disturbance."|FALSE
39064|"There may be anomalies enough apparent in the mental life: there may be"|FALSE
39064|"the great anomalies of Genius and of Freedom of Will; but the Newton and"|FALSE
39064|"the Kepler of psychology will show by calculation on assumed conditions of"|FALSE
39064|"psychic nature that these aberrations can be explained by mechanical laws."|FALSE
39064|"“The human Soul is no puppet-theatre: our wishes and resolutions are no"|FALSE
39064|"marionettes: no juggler stands behind; but our true and proper life lies"|FALSE
39064|"in our volition, and this life has its rule not outside, but in itself: it"|FALSE
39064|"has its own purely mental rule, by no means borrowed from the material"|FALSE
39064|"world. But this rule is in it sure and fixed; and on account of this its"|FALSE
39064|"fixed quality it has more similarity to (what is otherwise heterogeneous)"|FALSE
39064|"the laws of impact and pressure than to the marvels of an alleged"|FALSE
39064|"inexplicable freedom(31).”"|FALSE
39064|"Psychology then deals with a real, which exhibits phenomena analogous in"|FALSE
39064|"several respects to those discussed by statics and mechanics. Its"|FALSE
39064|"foundation is a statics and mechanics of the Soul,—as this real is called."|FALSE
39064|"We begin by presupposing as the ultimate reality, underlying the"|FALSE
39064|"factitious and generally imperfect unity of self-consciousness and mind,"|FALSE
39064|"an essential and primary unity—the unity of an absolutely simple or"|FALSE
39064|"individual point of being—a real point which amongst other points asserts"|FALSE
39064|"itself, maintains itself. It has a character of its own, but that"|FALSE
39064|"character it only shows in and through a development conditioned by"|FALSE
39064|"external influences. The specific nature of the soul-reality is to be"|FALSE
39064|"representative, to produce, or manifest itself in, ideas"|FALSE
39064|"(_Vorstellungen_). But the character only emerges into actuality in the"|FALSE
39064|"conflict of the soul-atom with other ultimate realities in the"|FALSE
39064|"congregation of things. A soul _per se_ or isolated is not possessed of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas. It is merely blank, undeveloped, formal unity, of which nothing can"|FALSE
39064|"be said. But like other realities it defines and characterises itself by"|FALSE
39064|"antithesis, by resistance: it shows what it is by its behaviour in the"|FALSE
39064|"struggle for existence. It acts in self-defence: and its peculiar style or"|FALSE
39064|"weapon of self-defence is an idea or representation. The way the Soul"|FALSE
39064|"maintains itself is by turning the assailant into an idea(32): and each"|FALSE
39064|"idea is therefore a _Selbsterhaltung_ of the Soul. The Soul is thus"|FALSE
39064|"enriched—to appearance or incidentally: and the assailant is annexed. In"|FALSE
39064|"this way the one Soul may develop or evolve or express an innumerable"|FALSE
39064|"variety of ideas: for in response to whatever it meets, the living and"|FALSE
39064|"active Soul ideates, or gives rise to a representation. Thus, while the"|FALSE
39064|"soul is one, its ideas or representations are many. Taken separately, they"|FALSE
39064|"each express the psychic self-conservation. But brought in relation with"|FALSE
39064|"each other, as so many acts or self-affirmations of the one soul, they"|FALSE
39064|"behave as forces, and tend to thwart or check each other. It is as forces,"|FALSE
39064|"as reciprocally arresting or fostering each other, that ideas are objects"|FALSE
39064|"of science. When a representation is thus held in check, it is reduced to"|FALSE
39064|"a mere endeavour or active tendency to represent. Thus there arises a"|FALSE
39064|"distinction between representations proper, and those imperfect states or"|FALSE
39064|"acts which are partly or wholly held in abeyance. But the latent phase of"|FALSE
39064|"an idea is as essential to a thorough understanding of it as what appears."|FALSE
39064|"It is the great blunder of empirical psychology to ignore what is sunk"|FALSE
39064|"below the surface of consciousness. And to Herbart consciousness is not"|FALSE
39064|"the condition but rather the product of ideas, which are primarily forces."|FALSE
39064|"But representations are not merely in opposition,—impinging and resisting."|FALSE
39064|"The same reason which makes them resist, viz. that they are or would fain"|FALSE
39064|"be acts of the one soul, but are more or less incompatible, leads them in"|FALSE
39064|"other circumstances to form combinations with each other. These"|FALSE
39064|"combinations are of two sorts. They are, first, complications, or"|FALSE
39064|"“complexions”: a number of ideas combine by quasi-addition and"|FALSE
39064|"juxtaposition to form a total. Second, there is fusion: ideas presenting"|FALSE
39064|"certain degrees of contrast enter into a union where the parts are no"|FALSE
39064|"longer separately perceptible. It is easy to see how the problems of"|FALSE
39064|"psychology now assume the form of a statics and mechanics of the mind."|FALSE
39064|"Quantitative data are to be sought in the strength of each separate single"|FALSE
39064|"idea, and the degree in which two or more ideas block each other: in the"|FALSE
39064|"degree of combination between ideas, and the number of ideas in a"|FALSE
39064|"combination: and in the terms of relation between the members of a series"|FALSE
39064|"of ideas. A statical theory has to show the conditions required for what"|FALSE
39064|"we may call the ideal state of equilibrium of the “idea-forces”: to"|FALSE
39064|"determine, that is, the ultimate degree of obscuration suffered by any two"|FALSE
39064|"ideas of different strength, and the conditions of their permanent"|FALSE
39064|"combination or fusion. A mechanics of the mind will, on the contrary, deal"|FALSE
39064|"with the rate at which these processes are brought about, the velocity"|FALSE
39064|"with which in the movement of mind ideas are obscured or reawakened, &c."|FALSE
39064|"It is fortunately unnecessary, here, to go further into details. What"|FALSE
39064|"Herbart proposes is not a method for the mathematical measurement of"|FALSE
39064|"psychic facts: it is a theory of mechanics and statics specially adapted"|FALSE
39064|"to the peculiarities of psychical phenomena, where the forces are given"|FALSE
39064|"with no sine or cosine, where instead of gravitation we have the constant"|FALSE
39064|"effort (as it were elasticity) of each idea to revert to its unchecked"|FALSE
39064|"state. He claims—in short—practically to be a Kepler and Newton of the"|FALSE
39064|"mind, and in so doing to justify the vague professions of more than one"|FALSE
39064|"writer on mind—above all, perhaps of David Hume, who goes beyond mere"|FALSE
39064|"professions—to make mental science follow the example of physics. And a"|FALSE
39064|"main argument in favour of his enterprise is the declaration of Kant that"|FALSE
39064|"no body of knowledge can claim to be a science except in such proportion"|FALSE
39064|"as it is mathematical. And the peculiarity of this enterprise is that"|FALSE
39064|"self-consciousness, the Ego, is not allowed to interfere with the free"|FALSE
39064|"play of psychic forces. The Ego is—psychologically—the result, the"|FALSE
39064|"product, and the varying product of that play. The play of forces is no"|FALSE
39064|"doubt a unity: but its unity lies not in the synthesis of consciousness,"|FALSE
39064|"but in the essential unity of Soul. And Soul is in its essence neither"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness, nor self-consciousness, nor mind: but something on the"|FALSE
39064|"basis of whose unity these are built up and developed(33). The mere"|FALSE
39064|"“representation” does not include the further supervenience of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness: it represents, but it is not as yet necessary that we"|FALSE
39064|"should also be conscious that there is representation. It is, in the"|FALSE
39064|"phrase of Leibniz, perception: but not apperception. It is mere"|FALSE
39064|"straight-out, not as yet reflected, representation. Gradually there"|FALSE
39064|"emerges through the operation of mechanical psychics a nucleus, a floating"|FALSE
39064|"unity, a fixed or definite central aggregate."|FALSE
39064|"The suggestion of mathematical method has been taken up by subsequent"|FALSE
39064|"inquirers (as it was pursued even before Herbart’s time), but not in the"|FALSE
39064|"sense he meant. Experimentation has now taken a prominent place in"|FALSE
39064|"psychology. But in proportion as it has done so, psychology has lost its"|FALSE
39064|"native character, and thrown itself into the arms of physiology. What"|FALSE
39064|"Herbart calculated were actions and reactions of idea-forces: what the"|FALSE
39064|"modern experimental school proposes to measure are to a large extent the"|FALSE
39064|"velocities of certain physiological processes, the numerical specification"|FALSE
39064|"of certain facts. Such ascertainments are unquestionably useful; as"|FALSE
39064|"numerical precision is in other departments. But, taken in themselves,"|FALSE
39064|"they do not carry us one bit further on the way to science. As"|FALSE
39064|"experiments, further,—to note a point discussed elsewhere(34)—their value"|FALSE
39064|"depends on the point of view, on the theory which has led to them, on the"|FALSE
39064|"value of the general scheme for which they are intended to provide a"|FALSE
39064|"special new determination. In many cases they serve to give a vivid"|FALSE
39064|"reality to what was veiled under a general phrase. The truth looks so much"|FALSE
39064|"more real when it is put in figures: as the size of a huge tree when set"|FALSE
39064|"against a rock; or as when Milton bodies out his fallen angel by setting"|FALSE
39064|"forth the ratio between his spear and the tallest Norway pine. But until"|FALSE
39064|"the general relationship between soul and body is more clearly formulated,"|FALSE
39064|"such statistics will have but a value of curiosity."|FALSE

39064|"What Herbart (as well as Hegel) finds perpetual ground for objecting to is"|FALSE
39064|"the talk about mental faculties. This objection is part of a general"|FALSE
39064|"characteristic of all the higher philosophy; and the recurrence of it"|FALSE
39064|"gives an illustration of how hard it is for any class of men to see"|FALSE
39064|"themselves as others see them. If there be anything the vulgar believe to"|FALSE
39064|"be true of philosophy, it is that it deals in distant and abstruse"|FALSE
39064|"generalities, that it neglects the shades of individuality and reality,"|FALSE
39064|"and launches out into unsubstantial general ideas. But it would be easy to"|FALSE
39064|"gather from the great thinkers an anthology of passages in which they hold"|FALSE
39064|"it forth as the great work of philosophy to rescue our conceptions from"|FALSE
39064|"the indefiniteness and generality of popular conception, and to give them"|FALSE
39064|"real, as opposed to a merely nominal, individuality."|FALSE
39064|"The Wolffian school, which Herbart (not less than Kant) found in"|FALSE
39064|"possession of the field, and which in Germany may be taken to represent"|FALSE
39064|"only a slight variant of the half-and-half attitude of vulgar thought, was"|FALSE
39064|"entrenched in the psychology of faculties. Empirical psychology, said"|FALSE
39064|"Wolff(35), tells the number and character of the soul’s faculties:"|FALSE
39064|"rational psychology will tell what they “properly” are, and how they"|FALSE
39064|"subsist in soul. It is assumed that there are general receptacles or"|FALSE
39064|"tendencies of mental operation which in course of time get filled or"|FALSE
39064|"qualified in a certain way: and that when this question is disposed of, it"|FALSE
39064|"still remains to fix on the metaphysical bases of these facts."|FALSE
39064|"That a doctrine of faculties should fix itself in psychology is not so"|FALSE
39064|"wonderful. In the non-psychical world objects are easily discriminated in"|FALSE
39064|"space, and the individual thing lasts through a time. But a phase of mind"|FALSE
39064|"is as such fleeting and indeterminate: its individual features which come"|FALSE
39064|"from its “object” tend soon to vanish in memory: all freshness of definite"|FALSE
39064|"characters wears off, and there is left behind only a vague “recept” of"|FALSE
39064|"the one and same in many, a sort of hypostatised representative, faint but"|FALSE
39064|"persistent, of what in experience was an ever-varying succession. We"|FALSE
39064|"generalise here as elsewhere: but elsewhere the many singulars remain to"|FALSE
39064|"confront us more effectually. But in Mind the immense variety of real"|FALSE
39064|"imagination, memory, judgment is forgotten, and the name in each case"|FALSE
39064|"reduced to a meagre abstract. Thus the identity in character and"|FALSE
39064|"operation, having been cut off from the changing elements in its real"|FALSE
39064|"action, is transmuted into a substantial somewhat, a subsistent faculty."|FALSE
39064|"The relationship of one to another of the powers thus by abstraction and"|FALSE
39064|"fancy created becomes a problem of considerable moment, their causal"|FALSE
39064|"relations in particular: till in the end they stand outside and"|FALSE
39064|"independent of each other, engaged, as Herbart says, in a veritable"|FALSE
39064|"_bellum omnium contra omnes_."|FALSE
39064|"But this hypostatising of faculties becomes a source of still further"|FALSE
39064|"difficulties when it is taken in connexion with the hypostasis of the Soul"|FALSE
39064|"or Self or Ego. To Aristotle the Soul in its general aspect is Energy or"|FALSE
39064|"Essence; and its individual phases are energies. But in the hands of the"|FALSE
39064|"untrained these conceptions came to be considerably displaced. Essence or"|FALSE
39064|"Substance came to be understood (as may be seen in Locke, and still more"|FALSE
39064|"in loose talk) as a something,—a substratum,—or peculiar nature—(of which"|FALSE
39064|"_in itself_ nothing further could be said(36) but which notwithstanding"|FALSE
39064|"was permanent and perhaps imperishable): this something subsistent"|FALSE
39064|"exhibited certain properties or activities. There thus arose, on one hand,"|FALSE
39064|"the Soul-thing,—a substance misunderstood and sensualised with a"|FALSE
39064|"supernatural sensuousness,—a denizen of the transcendental or even of the"|FALSE
39064|"transcendent world: and, on the other hand, stood the actual"|FALSE
39064|"manifestations, the several exhibitions of this force, the assignable and"|FALSE
39064|"describable psychic facts. We are accordingly brought before the problem"|FALSE
39064|"of how this one substance or essence stands to the several entities or"|FALSE
39064|"hypostases known as faculties. And we still have in the rear the further"|FALSE
39064|"problem of how these abstract entities stand to the real and concrete"|FALSE
39064|"single acts and states of soul and mind."|FALSE
39064|"This hypostatising of faculties, and this distinction of the “Substantial”"|FALSE
39064|"soul from its “accidentia” or phenomena, had grown—through the"|FALSE
39064|"materialistic proclivities of popular conception—from the indications"|FALSE
39064|"found in Aristotle. It attained its climax, perhaps in the Wolffian school"|FALSE
39064|"in Germany, but it has been the resort of superficial psychology in all"|FALSE
39064|"ages. For while it, on one hand, seemed to save the substantial Soul on"|FALSE
39064|"whose incorruptibility great issues were believed to hinge, it held out,"|FALSE
39064|"on the other, an open hand to the experimental inquirer, whom it bade"|FALSE
39064|"freely to search amongst the phenomena. But if it was the refuge of"|FALSE
39064|"pusillanimity, it was also the perpetual object of censure from all the"|FALSE
39064|"greater and bolder spirits. Thus, the psychology of Hobbes may be hasty"|FALSE
39064|"and crude, but it is at least animated by a belief that the mental life is"|FALSE
39064|"continuous, and not cut off by abrupt divisions severing the mental"|FALSE
39064|"faculties. The “image” (according to his materialistically coloured"|FALSE
39064|"psychology) which, when it is a strong motion, is called sense, passes, as"|FALSE
39064|"it becomes weaker or decays, into imagination, and gives rise, by its"|FALSE
39064|"various complications and associations with others, to reminiscence,"|FALSE
39064|"experience, expectation. Similarly, the voluntary motion which is an"|FALSE
39064|"effect or a phase of imagination, beginning at first in small"|FALSE
39064|"motions—called by themselves “endeavours,” and in relation to their cause"|FALSE
39064|"“appetites” or “desires(37)”—leads on cumulatively to Will, which is the"|FALSE
39064|"“last appetite in deliberating.” Spinoza, his contemporary, speaks in the"|FALSE
39064|"same strain(38). “Faculties of intellect, desire, love, &c., are either"|FALSE
39064|"utterly fictitious, or nothing but metaphysical entities, or universals"|FALSE
39064|"which we are in the habit of forming from particulars. Will and intellect"|FALSE
39064|"are thus supposed to stand to this or that idea, this or that volition, in"|FALSE
39064|"the same way as stoniness to this or that stone, or as man to Peter or"|FALSE
39064|"Paul.” They are supposed to be a general something which gets defined and"|FALSE
39064|"detached. But, in the mind, or in the cogitant soul, there are no such"|FALSE
39064|"things. There are only ideas: and by an “idea” we are to understand not an"|FALSE
39064|"image on the retina or in the brain, not a “dumb something, like a"|FALSE
39064|"painting on a panel(39),” but a mode of thinking, or even the act of"|FALSE
39064|"intellection itself. The ideas _are_ the mind: mind does not _have_ ideas."|FALSE
39064|"Further, every “idea,” as such, “involves affirmation or negation,”—is not"|FALSE
39064|"an image, but an act of judgment—contains, as we should say, an implicit"|FALSE
39064|"reference to actuality,—a reference which in volition is made explicit."|FALSE
39064|"Thus (concludes the corollary of Eth. ii. 49) “Will and Intellect are one"|FALSE
39064|"and the same.” But in any case the “faculties” as such are no better than"|FALSE
39064|"_entia rationis_ (i.e. auxiliary modes of representing facts)."|FALSE
39064|"Leibniz speaks no less distinctly and sanely in this direction. “True"|FALSE
39064|"powers are never mere possibilities: they are always tendency and action.”"|FALSE
39064|"The “Monad”—that is the quasi-intelligent unit of existence,—is"|FALSE
39064|"essentially activity, and its actions are perceptions and appetitions,"|FALSE
39064|"i.e. tendencies to pass from one perceptive state or act to another. It is"|FALSE
39064|"out of the variety, the complication, and relations of these miniature or"|FALSE
39064|"little perceptions and appetitions, that the conspicuous phenomena of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness are to be explained, and not by supposing them due to one or"|FALSE
39064|"other faculty. The soul is a unity, a self-developing unity, a unity which"|FALSE
39064|"at each stage of its existence shows itself in a perception or idea,—each"|FALSE
39064|"such perception however being, to repeat the oft quoted phrase, _plein de"|FALSE
39064|"l’avenir et chargé du passé_:—each, in other words, is not stationary, but"|FALSE
39064|"active and urgent, a progressive force, as well as a representative"|FALSE
39064|"element. Above all, Leibniz has the view that the soul gives rise to all"|FALSE
39064|"its ideas from itself: that its life is its own production, not a mere"|FALSE
39064|"inheritance of ideas which it has from birth and nature, nor a mere"|FALSE
39064|"importation into an empty room from without, but a necessary result of its"|FALSE
39064|"own constitution acting in necessary (predetermined) reciprocity and"|FALSE
39064|"harmony with the rest of the universe."|FALSE
39064|"But Hobbes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, were most attentively heard in the"|FALSE
39064|"passages where they favoured or combatted the dominant social and"|FALSE
39064|"theological prepossessions. Their glimpses of truer insight and even their"|FALSE
39064|"palpable contributions in the line of a true psychology were ignored or"|FALSE
39064|"forgotten. More attention, perhaps, was attracted by an attempt of a very"|FALSE
39064|"different style. This was the system of Condillac, who, as Hegel says (p."|FALSE
39064|"61), made an unmistakable attempt to show the necessary interconnexion of"|FALSE
39064|"the several modes of mental activity. In his _Traité des Sensations_"|FALSE
39064|"(1754), following on his _Essai sur l’origine des connaissances humaines_"|FALSE
39064|"(1746), he tried to carry out systematically the deduction or derivation"|FALSE
39064|"of all our ideas from sense, or to trace the filiation of all our"|FALSE
39064|"faculties from sensation. Given a mind with no other power than"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility, the problem is to show how it acquires all its other"|FALSE
39064|"faculties. Let us then suppose a sentient animal to which is offered a"|FALSE
39064|"single sensation, or one sensation standing out above the others. In such"|FALSE
39064|"circumstances the sensation “becomes” (_devient_) attention: or a"|FALSE
39064|"sensation “is” (_est_) attention, either because it is alone, or because"|FALSE
39064|"it is more lively than all the rest. Again: before such a being, let us"|FALSE
39064|"set two sensations: to perceive or feel (_apercevoir ou sentir_) the two"|FALSE
39064|"sensations is the same thing (_c’est la même chose_). If one of the"|FALSE
39064|"sensations is not present, but a sensation made already, then to perceive"|FALSE
39064|"it is memory. Memory, then, is only “transformed sensation” (_sensation"|FALSE
39064|"transformée_). Further, suppose we attend to both ideas, this is “the same"|FALSE
39064|"thing” as to compare them. And to compare them we must see difference or"|FALSE
39064|"resemblance. This is judgment. “Thus sensation becomes successively"|FALSE
39064|"attention, comparison, judgment.” And—by further steps of the equating"|FALSE
39064|"process—it appears that sensation again “becomes” an act of reflection."|FALSE
39064|"And the same may be said of imagination and reasoning: all are transformed"|FALSE
39064|"sensations."|FALSE
39064|"If this is so with the intelligence, it is equally the case with the Will."|FALSE
39064|"To feel and not feel well or ill is impossible. Coupling then this feeling"|FALSE
39064|"of pleasure or pain with the sensation and its transformations, we get the"|FALSE
39064|"series of phases ranging from desire, to passion, hope, will. “Desire is"|FALSE
39064|"only the action of the same faculties as are attributed to the"|FALSE
39064|"understanding.” A lively desire is a passion: a desire, accompanied with a"|FALSE
39064|"belief that nothing stands in its way, is a volition. But combine these"|FALSE
39064|"affective with the intellectual processes already noticed, and you have"|FALSE
39064|"thinking (_penser_)(40). Thus thought in its entirety is, only and always,"|FALSE
39064|"transformed sensation."|FALSE
39064|"Something not unlike this, though scarcely so simply and directly"|FALSE
39064|"doctrinaire, is familiar to us in some English psychology, notably James"|FALSE
39064|"Mill’s(41). Taken in their literal baldness, these identifications may"|FALSE
39064|"sound strained,—or trifling. But if we look beyond the words, we can"|FALSE
39064|"detect a genuine instinct for maintaining and displaying the unity and"|FALSE
39064|"continuity of mental life through all its modifications,—coupled"|FALSE
39064|"unfortunately with a bias sometimes in favour of reducing higher or more"|FALSE
39064|"complex states of mind to a mere prolongation of lower and beggarly"|FALSE
39064|"rudiments. But otherwise such analyses are useful as aids against the"|FALSE
39064|"tendency of inert thought to take every name in this department as a"|FALSE
39064|"distinguishable reality: the tendency to part will from thought—ideas from"|FALSE
39064|"emotion—and even imagination from reason, as if either could be what it"|FALSE
39064|"professed without the other."|FALSE
39064|"(iv.) Methods and Problems of Psychology."|FALSE
39064|"The difficulties of modern psychology perhaps lie in other directions, but"|FALSE
39064|"they are not less worth guarding against. They proceed mainly from failure"|FALSE
39064|"or inability to grasp the central problem of psychology, and a disposition"|FALSE
39064|"to let the pen (if it be a book on the subject) wander freely through the"|FALSE
39064|"almost illimitable range of instance, illustration, and application."|FALSE
39064|"Though it is true that the proper study of mankind is man, it is hardly"|FALSE
39064|"possible to say what might not be brought under this head. _Homo sum,"|FALSE
39064|"nihil a me alienum puto_, it might be urged. Placed in a sort of middle"|FALSE
39064|"ground between physiology (summing up all the results of physical science)"|FALSE
39064|"and general history (including the contributions of all the branches of"|FALSE
39064|"sociology), the psychologist need not want for material. He can wander"|FALSE
39064|"into ethics, aesthetic, and logic, into epistemology and metaphysics. And"|FALSE
39064|"it cannot be said with any conviction that he is actually trespassing, so"|FALSE
39064|"long as the ground remains so ill-fenced and vaguely enclosed. A desultory"|FALSE
39064|"collection of observations on traits of character, anecdotes of mental"|FALSE
39064|"events, mixed up with hypothetical descriptions of how a normal human"|FALSE
39064|"being may be supposed to develop his so-called faculties, and including"|FALSE
39064|"some dictionary-like verbal distinctions, may make a not uninteresting and"|FALSE
39064|"possibly bulky work entitled Psychology."|FALSE
39064|"It is partly a desire of keeping up to date which is responsible for the"|FALSE
39064|"copious extracts or abstracts from treatises on the anatomy and functions"|FALSE
39064|"of the nerve-system, which, accompanied perhaps by a diagram of the brain,"|FALSE
39064|"often form the opening chapter of a work on psychology. Even if these"|FALSE
39064|"researches had achieved a larger number of authenticated results than they"|FALSE
39064|"as yet have, they would only form an appendix and an illustration to the"|FALSE
39064|"proper subject(42). As they stand, and so long as they remain largely"|FALSE
39064|"hypothetical, the use of them in psychology only fosters the common"|FALSE
39064|"delusion that, when we can picture out in material outlines a theory"|FALSE
39064|"otherwise unsupported, it has gained some further witness in its favour."|FALSE
39064|"It is quite arguable indeed that it may be useful to cut out a section"|FALSE
39064|"from general human biology which should include the parts of it that were"|FALSE
39064|"specially interesting in connexion with the expression or generation of"|FALSE
39064|"thought, emotion, and desire. But in that case, there is a blunder in"|FALSE
39064|"singling out the brain alone, and especially the organs of sense and"|FALSE
39064|"voluntary motion,—except for the reason that this province of"|FALSE
39064|"psycho-physics alone has been fairly mapped out. The preponderant half of"|FALSE
39064|"the soul’s life is linked to other parts of the physical system. Emotion"|FALSE
39064|"and volition, and the general tone of the train of ideas, if they are to"|FALSE
39064|"be connected with their expression and physical accompaniment (or aspect),"|FALSE
39064|"would require a sketch of the heart and lungs, as well as the digestive"|FALSE
39064|"system in general. Nor these alone. Nerve analysis (especially confined to"|FALSE
39064|"the larger system), though most modern, is not alone important, as Plato"|FALSE
39064|"and Aristotle well saw. So that if biology is to be adapted for"|FALSE
39064|"psychological use (and if psychology deals with more than cognitive"|FALSE
39064|"processes), a liberal amount of physiological information seems required."|FALSE
39064|"Experimental psychology is a term used with a considerable laxity of"|FALSE
39064|"content; and so too is that of physiological psychology, or"|FALSE
39064|"psycho-physics. And the laxity mainly arises because there is an"|FALSE
39064|"uncertainty as to what is principal and what secondary in the inquiry."|FALSE
39064|"Experiment is obviously a help to observation: and so far as the latter is"|FALSE
39064|"practicable, the former would seem to have a chance of introduction. But"|FALSE
39064|"in any case, experiment is only a means to an end and only practicable"|FALSE
39064|"under the guidance of hypothesis and theory. Its main value would be in"|FALSE
39064|"case the sphere of psychology were completely paralleled with one province"|FALSE
39064|"of physiology. It was long ago maintained by Spinoza and (in a way by)"|FALSE
39064|"Leibniz, that there is no mental phenomenon without its bodily equivalent,"|FALSE
39064|"pendant, or correspondent. The _ordo rerum_ (the molecular system of"|FALSE
39064|"movements) is, he held, the same as the order of ideas. But it is only at"|FALSE
39064|"intervals, under special conditions, or when they reach a certain"|FALSE
39064|"magnitude, that ideas emerge into full consciousness. As consciousness"|FALSE
39064|"presents them, they are often discontinuous, and abrupt: and they do not"|FALSE
39064|"always carry with them their own explanation. Hence if we are confined to"|FALSE
39064|"the larger phenomena of consciousness alone, our science is imperfect:"|FALSE
39064|"many things seem anomalous; above all, perhaps, will, attention, and the"|FALSE
39064|"like. We have seen how Herbart (partly following the hints of Leibniz),"|FALSE
39064|"attempted to get over this difficulty by the hypothesis of idea-forces"|FALSE
39064|"which generate the forms and matter of consciousness by their mutual"|FALSE
39064|"impact and resistance. Physiological psychology substitutes for Herbart’s"|FALSE
39064|"reals and his idea-forces a more materialistic sort of reality; perhaps"|FALSE
39064|"functions of nerve-cells, or other analogous entities. There, it hopes one"|FALSE
39064|"day to discover the underlying continuity of event which in the upper"|FALSE
39064|"range of consciousness is often obscured, and then the process would be,"|FALSE
39064|"as the phrase goes, explained: we should be able to picture it out without"|FALSE
39064|"a gap."|FALSE
39064|"These large hopes may have a certain fulfilment. They may lead to the"|FALSE
39064|"withdrawal of some of the fictitious mental processes which are still"|FALSE
39064|"described in works of psychology. But on the whole they can only have a"|FALSE
39064|"negative and auxiliary value. The value, that is, of helping to confute"|FALSE
39064|"feigned connexions and to suggest truer. They will be valid against the"|FALSE
39064|"mode of thought which, when Psyché fails us for an explanation, turns to"|FALSE
39064|"body, and interpolates soul between the states of body: the mode which, in"|FALSE
39064|"an older phraseology, jumps from final causes to physical, and from"|FALSE
39064|"physical (or efficient) to final. Here, as elsewhere, the physical has its"|FALSE
39064|"place: and here, more than in many places, the physical has been unfairly"|FALSE
39064|"treated. But the whole subject requires a discussion of the so-called"|FALSE
39064|"“relations” of soul and body: a subject on which popular conceptions and"|FALSE
39064|"so-called science are radically obscure."|FALSE
39064|"“But the danger which threatens experimental psychology,” says"|FALSE
39064|"Münsterberg, “is that, in investigating details, the connexion with"|FALSE
39064|"questions of principle may be so lost sight of that the investigation"|FALSE
39064|"finally lands at objects scientifically quite worthless(43). Psychology"|FALSE
39064|"forgets only too easily that all those numerical statistics which"|FALSE
39064|"experiment allows us to form are only means for psychological analysis and"|FALSE
39064|"interpretation, not ends in themselves. It piles up numbers and numbers,"|FALSE
39064|"and fails to ask whether the results so formed have any theoretical value"|FALSE
39064|"whatever: it seeks answers before a question has been clearly and"|FALSE
39064|"distinctly framed; whereas the value of experimental answers always"|FALSE
39064|"depends on the exactitude with which the question is put. Let me remind"|FALSE
39064|"the reader, how one inquirer after another made many thousand experiments"|FALSE
39064|"on the estimation of small intervals of time, without a single one of them"|FALSE
39064|"raising the question what the precise point was which these experiments"|FALSE
39064|"sought to measure, what was the psychological occurrence in the case, or"|FALSE
39064|"what psychological phenomena were employed as the standard of"|FALSE
39064|"time-intervals. And so each had his own arbitrary standard of measurement,"|FALSE
39064|"each of them piled up mountains of numbers, each demonstrated that his"|FALSE
39064|"predecessor was wrong; but neither Estel nor Mehner have carried the"|FALSE
39064|"problem of the time-sense a single step further."|FALSE
39064|"“This must be all changed, if we are not to drift into the barrenest"|FALSE
39064|"scholastic.... Everywhere out of the correct perception that problems of"|FALSE
39064|"principle demand the investigation of detailed phenomena, and that the"|FALSE
39064|"latter investigation must proceed in comparative independence of the"|FALSE
39064|"question of principles, there has grown the false belief that the"|FALSE
39064|"description of detail phenomena is the ultimate aim of science. And so,"|FALSE
39064|"side by side with details which are of importance to principles, we have"|FALSE
39064|"others, utterly indifferent and theoretically worthless, treated with the"|FALSE
39064|"same zeal. To the solution of their barren problems the old Schoolmen"|FALSE
39064|"applied a certain acuteness; but in order to turn out masses of numbers"|FALSE
39064|"from barren experiments, all that is needed is a certain insensibility to"|FALSE
39064|"fits of ennui. Let numbers be less collected for their own sake: and"|FALSE
39064|"instead, let the problems be so brought to a point that the answers may"|FALSE
39064|"possess the character of principles. Let each experiment be founded on far"|FALSE
39064|"more theoretical considerations, then the number of the experiments may be"|FALSE
39064|"largely diminished(44).”"|FALSE
39064|"What is thus said of a special group of inquiries by one of the foremost"|FALSE
39064|"of the younger psychologists, is not without its bearings on all the"|FALSE
39064|"departments in which psychology can learn. For physiological, or what is"|FALSE
39064|"technically called psychological, experiment, is co-ordinate with many"|FALSE
39064|"other sources of information. Much, for instance, is to be learnt by a"|FALSE
39064|"careful study of language by those who combine sound linguistic knowledge"|FALSE
39064|"with psychological training. It is in language, spoken and written, that"|FALSE
39064|"we find at once the great instrument and the great document of the"|FALSE
39064|"distinctively human progress from a mere _Psyche_ to a mature _Nous_, from"|FALSE
39064|"Soul to Mind. Whether we look at the varieties of its structure under"|FALSE
39064|"different ethnological influences, or at the stages of its growth in a"|FALSE
39064|"nation and an individual, we get light from language on the"|FALSE
39064|"differentiation and consolidation of ideas. But here again it is easy to"|FALSE
39064|"lose oneself in the world of etymology, or to be carried away into the"|FALSE
39064|"enticing questions of real and ideal philology."|FALSE
39064|"“The human being of the psychologist,” says Herbart(45), “is the social"|FALSE
39064|"and civilised human being who stands on the apex of the whole history"|FALSE
39064|"through which his race has passed. In him is found visibly together all"|FALSE
39064|"the multiplicity of elements, which, under the name of mental faculties,"|FALSE
39064|"are regarded as a universal inheritance of humanity. Whether they are"|FALSE
39064|"originally in conjunction, whether they are originally a multiplicity, is"|FALSE
39064|"a point on which the facts are silent. The savage and the new-born child"|FALSE
39064|"give us far less occasion to admire the range of their mind than do the"|FALSE
39064|"nobler animals. But the psychologists get out of this difficulty by the"|FALSE
39064|"unwarranted assumption that all the higher mental activities exist"|FALSE
39064|"potentially in children and savages—though not in the animals—as a"|FALSE
39064|"rudimentary predisposition or psychical endowment. Of such a nascent"|FALSE
39064|"intellect, a nascent reason, and nascent moral sense, they find"|FALSE
39064|"recognisable traces in the scanty similarities which the behaviour of"|FALSE
39064|"child or savage offers to those of civilised man. We cannot fail to note"|FALSE
39064|"that in their descriptions they have before them a special state of man,"|FALSE
39064|"and one which, far from accurately defined, merely follows the general"|FALSE
39064|"impression made upon us by those beings we name civilised. An extremely"|FALSE
39064|"fluctuating character inevitably marks this total impression. For there"|FALSE
39064|"are no general facts:—the genuine psychological documents lie in the"|FALSE
39064|"momentary states of individuals: and there is an immeasurably long way"|FALSE
39064|"from these to the height of the universal concept of man in general.”"|FALSE
39064|"And yet Man in general,—Man as man and therefore as mind—the concept of"|FALSE
39064|"Man—normal and ideal man—the complete and adequate Idea of man—is the true"|FALSE
39064|"terminus of the psychological process; and whatever be the difficulties in"|FALSE
39064|"the way, it is the only proper goal of the science. Only it has to be"|FALSE
39064|"built up, constructed, evolved, developed,—and not assumed as a datum of"|FALSE
39064|"popular imagination. We want a concept, concrete and real, of Man and of"|FALSE
39064|"Mind, which shall give its proper place to each of the elements that, in"|FALSE
39064|"the several examples open to detailed observation, are presented with"|FALSE
39064|"unfair or exaggerated prominence. The savage and the child are not to be"|FALSE
39064|"left out as free from contributing to form the ideal: virtues here are not"|FALSE
39064|"more important than vices, and are certainly not likely to be so"|FALSE
39064|"informing: even the insane and the idiot show us what human intelligence"|FALSE
39064|"is and requires: and the animals are also within the sweep of psychology."|FALSE
39064|"Man is not its theatre to the exclusion of woman; if it records the"|FALSE
39064|"results of introspection of the Me, it will find vast and copious quarries"|FALSE
39064|"in the various modes in which an individual identifies himself with others"|FALSE
39064|"as We. And even the social and civilised man gets his designation, as"|FALSE
39064|"usual, _a potiori_. He is more civilised and social than others: perhaps"|FALSE
39064|"rather more civilised than not. But always, in some measure, he is at the"|FALSE
39064|"same time unsocial or anti-social, and uncivilised. Each unit in the"|FALSE
39064|"society of civilisation has to the outside observer—and sometimes even to"|FALSE
39064|"his own self-detached and impartial survey—a certain oddity or fixity, a"|FALSE
39064|"gleam of irrationality, which shows him to fall short of complete sanity"|FALSE
39064|"or limpid and mobile intelligence. He has not wholly put off the"|FALSE
39064|"savage,—least of all, says the cynic, in his relations with the other sex."|FALSE
39064|"He carries with him even to the grave some grains of the recklessness and"|FALSE
39064|"petulance of childhood. And rarely, if ever, can it be said of him that he"|FALSE
39064|"has completely let the ape and tiger die."|FALSE
39064|"But that is only one way of looking at the matter—and one which, perhaps,"|FALSE
39064|"is more becoming to the pathologist and the cynic, than to the"|FALSE
39064|"psychologist. Each of these stages of psychical development, even if that"|FALSE
39064|"development be obviously describable as degeneration, has something which,"|FALSE
39064|"duly adjusted, has its place and function in the theory of the"|FALSE
39064|"normally-complete human mind. The animal, the savage, and the child,—each"|FALSE
39064|"has its part there. It is a mutilated, one-sided and superficial advance"|FALSE
39064|"in socialisation which cuts off the civilised creature from the natural"|FALSE
39064|"stem of his ancestry, from the large freedom, the immense _insouciance_,"|FALSE
39064|"the childlikeness of his first estate. There is something, again, wanting"|FALSE
39064|"in the man who utterly lacks the individualising realism and tenderness of"|FALSE
39064|"the woman, as in the woman who can show no comprehension of view or"|FALSE
39064|"bravery of enterprise. Even pathological states of mind are not mere"|FALSE
39064|"anomalies and mere degenerations. Nature perhaps knows no proper"|FALSE
39064|"degenerations, but only by-ways and intricacies in the course of"|FALSE
39064|"development. Still less is the vast enormity or irregularity of genius to"|FALSE
39064|"be ignored. It is all—to the philosophic mind—a question of degree and"|FALSE
39064|"proportion,—though often the proportion seems to exceed the scale of our"|FALSE
39064|"customary denominators. If an element is latent or quiescent (in arrest),"|FALSE
39064|"that is no index to its absolute amount: “we know not what’s resisted.”"|FALSE
39064|"Let us by all means keep proudly to our happy mediocrity of faculty, and"|FALSE
39064|"step clear of insanity or idiotcy on one hand, and from genius or heroism"|FALSE
39064|"on the other. But the careful observer will notwithstanding note how"|FALSE
39064|"delicately graded and how intricately combined are the steps which connect"|FALSE
39064|"extremes so terribly disparate. It is only vulgar ignorance which turns"|FALSE
39064|"away in hostility or contempt from the imbecile and the deranged, and only"|FALSE
39064|"a worse than vulgar sciolism which sees in genius and the hero nothing but"|FALSE
39064|"an aberration from its much-prized average. Criminalistic anthropology, or"|FALSE
39064|"the psychology of the criminal, may have indulged in much frantic"|FALSE
39064|"exaggeration as to the doom which nature and heredity have pronounced over"|FALSE
39064|"the fruit of the womb even before it entered the shores of light: yet they"|FALSE
39064|"have at least served to discredit the free and easy assumption of the"|FALSE
39064|"abstract averagist, and shown how little the penalties of an unbending law"|FALSE
39064|"meet the requirements of social well-being."|FALSE
39064|"Yet, if psychology be willing to learn in all these and other provinces of"|FALSE
39064|"the estate of man, it must remember that, once it goes beyond the narrow"|FALSE
39064|"range in which the interpretations of symbol and expression have become"|FALSE
39064|"familiar, it is constantly liable to blunder in the inevitable effort to"|FALSE
39064|"translate observation into theory. The happy mean between making too much"|FALSE
39064|"of palpable differences and hurrying on to a similar rendering of similar"|FALSE
39064|"signs is the rarest of gifts. Or, perhaps, it were truer to say it is the"|FALSE
39064|"latest and most hardly won of acquirements. To learn to observe—observe"|FALSE
39064|"with mind—is not a small thing. There are rules for it—both rules of"|FALSE
39064|"general scope and, above all, rules in each special department. But like"|FALSE
39064|"all “major premisses” in practice, everything depends on the power of"|FALSE
39064|"judgment, the tact, the skill, the “gift” of applying them. They work not"|FALSE
39064|"as mere rules to be conned by rote, but as principles assimilated into"|FALSE
39064|"constituents of the mental life-blood: rules which serve only as condensed"|FALSE
39064|"reminders and hints of habits of thought and methods of research which"|FALSE
39064|"have grown up in action and reflection. To observe we must comprehend: yet"|FALSE
39064|"we can only comprehend by observing. We all know how unintelligible—save"|FALSE
39064|"for epochs of ampler reciprocity, and it may be even of acquired unity of"|FALSE
39064|"interest—the two sexes are for each other. Parents can remember how"|FALSE
39064|"mysteriously minded they found their own elders; and in most cases they"|FALSE
39064|"have to experience the depth of the gulf which in certain directions parts"|FALSE
39064|"them from their children’s hearts. Even in civilised Europe, the ordinary"|FALSE
39064|"member of each nation has an underlying conviction (which at moments of"|FALSE
39064|"passion or surprise will rise and find harsh utterance) that the foreigner"|FALSE
39064|"is queer, irrational, and absurd. If the foreigner, further, be so far"|FALSE
39064|"removed as a Chinaman (or an Australian “black”), there is hardly anything"|FALSE
39064|"too vile, meaningless, or inhuman which the European will not readily"|FALSE
39064|"believe in the case of one who, it may be, in turn describes him as a"|FALSE
39064|"“foreign devil.” It can only be in a fit of noble chivalry that the"|FALSE
39064|"British rank and file can so far temporise with its insular prejudice as"|FALSE
39064|"to admit of “Fuzzy-wuzzy” that"|FALSE
39064|"    “He’s a poor benighted ’eathen—but a first-class fightin’ man.”"|FALSE
39064|"Not every one is an observer who chooses to dub himself so, nor is it in a"|FALSE
39064|"short lapse of time and with condescension for foreign habits, that any"|FALSE
39064|"observer whatever can become a trustworthy reporter of the ideas some"|FALSE
39064|"barbarian tribe holds concerning the things of earth and air, and the"|FALSE
39064|"hidden things of spirits and gods. The “interviewer” no doubt is a useful"|FALSE
39064|"being when it is necessary to find “copy,” or when sharp-drawn characters"|FALSE
39064|"and picturesque incidents are needed to stimulate an inert public, ever"|FALSE
39064|"open to be interested in some new thing. But he is a poor contributor to"|FALSE
39064|"the stored materials of science."|FALSE
39064|"It is of other stuff that true science is made. And if even years of"|FALSE
39064|"nominal intercourse and spatial juxtaposition sometimes leave human"|FALSE
39064|"beings, as regards their inner selves, in the position of strangers still,"|FALSE
39064|"what shall be said of the attempt to discern the psychic life of animals?"|FALSE
39064|"Will the touch of curiosity which prompts us to watch the proceedings of"|FALSE
39064|"the strange creatures,—will a course of experimentation on their behaviour"|FALSE
39064|"under artificial conditions,—justify us in drawing liberal conclusions as"|FALSE
39064|"to why they so behaved, and what they thought and felt about it? It is"|FALSE
39064|"necessary in the first place to know what to observe, and how, and above"|FALSE
39064|"all what for. But that presumed, we must further live with the animals not"|FALSE
39064|"only as their masters and their examiners, but as their friends and"|FALSE
39064|"fellow-creatures; we must be able—and so lightly that no effort is"|FALSE
39064|"discernable—to lay aside the burden and garb of civilisation; we must"|FALSE
39064|"possess that stamp of sympathy and similarity which invites confidence,"|FALSE
39064|"and breaks down the reserve which our poor relations, whether human or"|FALSE
39064|"others, offer to the first approaches of a strange superior. It is"|FALSE
39064|"probable that in that case we should have less occasion to wonder at their"|FALSE
39064|"oddities or to admire their sagacity. But a higher and more philosophical"|FALSE
39064|"wonder might, as in other cases when we get inside the heart of our"|FALSE
39064|"subject, take the place of the cheap and childish love of marvels, or of"|FALSE
39064|"the vulgar straining after comic traits."|FALSE
39064|"Of all this mass of materials the psychologist proper can directly make"|FALSE
39064|"only a sparing use. Even as illustrations, his data must not be presented"|FALSE
39064|"too often in all their crude and undigested individuality, or he runs the"|FALSE
39064|"risk of leaving one-sided impressions. Every single instance,"|FALSE
39064|"individualised and historical,—unless it be exhibited by that true art of"|FALSE
39064|"genius which we cannot expect in the average psychologist—narrows, even"|FALSE
39064|"though it be but slightly, the complete and all-sided truth. Anecdotes are"|FALSE
39064|"good, and to the wise they convey a world of meaning, but to lesser minds"|FALSE
39064|"they sometimes suggest anything but the points they should accentuate."|FALSE
39064|"Without the detail of individual realistic study there is no psychology"|FALSE
39064|"worth the name. History, story, we must have: but at the same time, with"|FALSE
39064|"the philosopher, we must say, I don’t give much weight to stories. And"|FALSE
39064|"this is what will always—except in rare instances where something like"|FALSE
39064|"genius is conjoined with it—make esoteric science hard and unpopular. It"|FALSE
39064|"dare not—if it is true to its idea—rest on any amount of mere instances,"|FALSE
39064|"as isolated, unreduced facts. Yet it can only have real power so far as it"|FALSE
39064|"concentrates into itself the life-blood of many instances, and indeed"|FALSE
39064|"extracts the pith and unity of all instances."|FALSE
39064|"Nor, on the other hand, can it turn itself too directly and intently"|FALSE
39064|"towards practical applications. All this theory of mental progress from"|FALSE
39064|"the animate soul to the fullness of religion and science deals solely with"|FALSE
39064|"the universal process of education: “the education of humanity” we may"|FALSE
39064|"call it: the way in which mind is made true and real(46). It is therefore"|FALSE
39064|"a question of intricacy and of time how to carry over this general theory"|FALSE
39064|"into the arena of education as artificially directed and planned. To try"|FALSE
39064|"to do so at a single step would be to repeat the mistake of Plato, if"|FALSE
39064|"Plato may be taken to suppose (which seems incredible) that a theoretical"|FALSE
39064|"study of the dialectics of truth and goodness would enable his rulers,"|FALSE
39064|"without the training of special experience, to undertake the supreme tasks"|FALSE
39064|"of legislation or administration. All politics, like all education, rests"|FALSE
39064|"on these principles of the means and conditions of mental growth: but the"|FALSE
39064|"schooling of concrete life, though it may not develop the faculty of"|FALSE
39064|"formulating general laws, will often train better for the management of"|FALSE
39064|"the relative than a mere logical Scholastic in first or absolute"|FALSE
39064|"principles."|FALSE
39064|"In conclusion, there are one or two points which seem of cardinal"|FALSE
39064|"importance for the progress of psychology. (1) Its difference from the"|FALSE
39064|"physical sciences has to be set out: in other words, the peculiarity of"|FALSE
39064|"psychical fact. It will not do merely to say that experience marks out"|FALSE
39064|"these boundaries with sufficient clearness. On the contrary, the terms"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness, feeling, mind, &c., are evidently to many psychologists"|FALSE
39064|"mere names. In particular, the habits of physical research when introduced"|FALSE
39064|"into mental study lead to a good deal of what can only be called"|FALSE
39064|"mythology. (2) There should be a clearer recognition of the problem of the"|FALSE
39064|"relations of mental unity to mental elements. But to get that, a more"|FALSE
39064|"thorough logical and metaphysical preparation is needed than is usually"|FALSE
39064|"supposed necessary. The doctrine of identity and necessity, of universal"|FALSE
39064|"and individual, has to be faced, however tedious. (3) The distinction"|FALSE
39064|"between first-grade and second-grade elements and factors in the mental"|FALSE
39064|"life has to be realised. The mere idea as presentative or immediate has to"|FALSE
39064|"be kept clear of the more logico-reflective, or normative ideas, which"|FALSE
39064|"belong to judgment and reasoning. And the number of these grades in mental"|FALSE
39064|"development seems endless. (4) But, also, a separation is required—were it"|FALSE
39064|"but temporary—between what may be called principles, and what is detail."|FALSE
39064|"At present, in psychology, “principles” is a word almost without meaning."|FALSE
39064|"A complete all-explaining system is of course impossible at present and"|FALSE
39064|"may always be so. Yet if an effort of thought could be concentrated on"|FALSE
39064|"cardinal issues, and less padding of conventional and traditional detail"|FALSE
39064|"were foisted in, much might thereby be done to make detailed research"|FALSE
39064|"fruitful. (5) And finally, perhaps, if psychology be a philosophical"|FALSE
39064|"study, some hint as to its purpose and problem would be desirable. If it"|FALSE
39064|"is only an abstract branch of science, of course, no such hint is in"|FALSE
39064|"place."|FALSE
39064|"Essay III. On Some Psychological Aspects Of Ethics."|FALSE
39064|"Allusion has already been made to the question of the boundaries between"|FALSE
39064|"logic and psychology, between logic and ethics, ethics and psychology, and"|FALSE
39064|"psychology and epistemology. Each of these occasionally comes to cover"|FALSE
39064|"ground that seems more appropriate to the others. Logic is sometimes"|FALSE
39064|"restricted to denote the study of the conditions of derivative knowledge,"|FALSE
39064|"of the canons of inference and the modes of proof. If taken more widely as"|FALSE
39064|"the science of thought-form, it is supposed to imply a world of fixed or"|FALSE
39064|"stereotyped relations between ideas, a system of stable thoughts governed"|FALSE
39064|"by inflexible laws in an absolute order of immemorial or eternal truth. As"|FALSE
39064|"against such fixity, psychology is supposed to deal with these same ideas"|FALSE
39064|"as products—as growing out of a living process of thought—having a history"|FALSE
39064|"behind them and perhaps a prospect of further change. The genesis so given"|FALSE
39064|"may be either a mere chronicle-history, or it may be a philosophical"|FALSE
39064|"development. In the former case, it would note the occasions of incident"|FALSE
39064|"and circumstance, the reactions of mind and environment, under which the"|FALSE
39064|"ideas were formed. Such a psychological genesis of several ideas is found"|FALSE
39064|"in the Second Book of Locke’s Essay. In the latter case, the account would"|FALSE
39064|"be more concerned with the inner movement, the action and reaction in"|FALSE
39064|"ideas themselves, considered not as due to casual occurrences, but as"|FALSE
39064|"self-developing by an organic growth. But in either case, ideas would be"|FALSE
39064|"shown not to be ready-made and independently existing kinds in a world of"|FALSE
39064|"idea-things, and not to form an unchanging diagram or framework, but to be"|FALSE
39064|"a growth, to have a history, and a development. Psychology in this sense"|FALSE
39064|"would be a dynamical, as opposed to the supposed statical, treatment of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas and concepts in logic. But it may be doubted how far it is well to"|FALSE
39064|"call this psychology: unless psychology deals with the contents of the"|FALSE
39064|"mental life, in their meaning and purpose, instead of, as seems proper,"|FALSE
39064|"merely in their character of psychic events. Such psychology is rather an"|FALSE
39064|"evolutionist logic,—a dialectic process more than an analytic of a datum."|FALSE
39064|"In the same way, ethics may be brought into one kind of contact with"|FALSE
39064|"psychology. Ethics, like logic, may be supposed to presuppose and to deal"|FALSE
39064|"with a certain inflexible scheme of requirements, a world of moral order"|FALSE
39064|"governed by invariable or universal law; an eternal kingdom of right,"|FALSE
39064|"existing independently of human wills, but to be learned and followed out"|FALSE
39064|"in uncompromising obedience. As against this supposed absolute order,"|FALSE
39064|"psychology may be said to show the genesis of the idea of obligation and"|FALSE
39064|"duty, the growth of the authority of conscience, the formation of ideals,"|FALSE
39064|"the relativity of moral ideas. Here also it may reach this conclusion, by"|FALSE
39064|"a more external or a more internal mode of argument. It may try to show,"|FALSE
39064|"in other words, that circumstances give rise to these forms of estimating"|FALSE
39064|"conduct, or it may argue that they are a necessary development in the"|FALSE
39064|"human being, constituted as he is. It may again be doubted whether this is"|FALSE
39064|"properly called psychology. Yet its purport seems ultimately to be that"|FALSE
39064|"the objective order is misconceived when it is regarded as an external or"|FALSE
39064|"quasi-physical order: as a law written up and sanctioned with an external"|FALSE
39064|"authority—as, in Kant’s words, a heteronomy. If that order is objective,"|FALSE
39064|"it is so because it is also in a sense subjective: if it is above the mere"|FALSE
39064|"individuality of the individual, it is still in a way identical with his"|FALSE
39064|"true or universal self-hood. Thus “psychological” here means the"|FALSE
39064|"recognition that the logical and the moral law is an autonomy: that it is"|FALSE
39064|"not given, but though necessary, necessary by the inward movement of the"|FALSE
39064|"mind. The metaphor of law is, in brief, misleading. For, according to a"|FALSE
39064|"common, though probably an erroneous, analysis of that term, the essence"|FALSE
39064|"of a law in the political sphere is to be a species of command. And that"|FALSE
39064|"is rather a one-sidedly practical or aesthetic way of looking at it. The"|FALSE
39064|"essence of law in general, and the precondition of every law in special,"|FALSE
39064|"is rather uniformity and universality, self-consistency and absence of"|FALSE
39064|"contradiction: or, in other words, rationality. Its essential opposite—or"|FALSE
39064|"its contradiction in essence—is a privilege, an attempt at isolating a"|FALSE
39064|"case from others. It need not indeed always require bare"|FALSE
39064|"uniformity—require i.e. the same act to be done by different people: but"|FALSE
39064|"it must always require that every thing within its operation shall be"|FALSE
39064|"treated on principles of utter and thorough harmony and consistency. It"|FALSE
39064|"requires each thing to be treated on public principles and with publicity:"|FALSE
39064|"nothing apart and mere singular, as a mere incident or as a world by"|FALSE
39064|"itself. Differently it may be treated, but always on grounds of common"|FALSE
39064|"well-being, as part of an embracing system."|FALSE
39064|"There is probably another sense, however, in which psychology comes into"|FALSE
39064|"close relation with ethics. If we look on man as a microcosm, his inner"|FALSE
39064|"system will more or less reproduce the system of the larger world. The"|FALSE
39064|"older psychology used to distinguish an upper or superior order of"|FALSE
39064|"faculties from a lower or inferior. Thus in the intellectual sphere, the"|FALSE
39064|"intellect, judgment, and reason were set above the senses, imagination,"|FALSE
39064|"and memory. Among the active powers, reasonable will, practical reason and"|FALSE
39064|"conscience were ranked as paramount over the appetites and desires and"|FALSE
39064|"emotions. And this use of the word “faculty” is as old as Plato, who"|FALSE
39064|"regards science as a superior faculty to opinion or imagination. But this"|FALSE
39064|"application—which seems a perfectly legitimate one—does not, in the first"|FALSE
39064|"instance, belong to psychology at all. No doubt it is psychically"|FALSE
39064|"presented: but it has an other source. It springs from an appreciation, a"|FALSE
39064|"judgment of the comparative truth or reality of what the so-called"|FALSE
39064|"psychical act means or expresses. Such faculties are powers in a hierarchy"|FALSE
39064|"of means and ends and presuppose a normative or critical function which"|FALSE
39064|"has classified reality. Psychically, the elements which enter into"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge are not other than those which belong to opinion: but they are"|FALSE
39064|"nearer an adequate rendering of reality, they are truer, or nearer the"|FALSE
39064|"Idea. And in the main we may say, that is truer or more real which"|FALSE
39064|"succeeds in more completely organising and unifying elements—which rises"|FALSE
39064|"more and more above the selfish or isolated part into the thorough unity"|FALSE
39064|"of all parts."|FALSE
39064|"The superior faculty is therefore the more thorough organisation of that"|FALSE
39064|"which is elsewhere less harmoniously systematised. Opinion is fragmentary"|FALSE
39064|"and partial: it begins abruptly and casually from the unknown, and runs"|FALSE
39064|"off no less abruptly into the unknown. Knowledge, on the contrary, is"|FALSE
39064|"unified: and its unity gives it its strength and superiority. The powers"|FALSE
39064|"which thus exist are the subjective counterparts of objectively valuable"|FALSE
39064|"products. Thus, reason is the subjective counterpart of a world in which"|FALSE
39064|"all the constituents are harmonised and fall into due relationship. It is"|FALSE
39064|"a product or result, which is not psychologically, but logically or"|FALSE
39064|"morally important. It is a faculty, because it means that actually its"|FALSE
39064|"possessor has ordered and systematised his life or his ideas of things."|FALSE
39064|"Psychologically, it, like unreason, is a compound of elements: but in the"|FALSE
39064|"case of reason the composition is unendingly and infinitely consistent; it"|FALSE
39064|"is knowledge completely unified. The distinction then is not in the"|FALSE
39064|"strictest sense psychological: for it has an aesthetic or normative"|FALSE
39064|"character; it is logical or ethical: it denotes that the idea or the act"|FALSE
39064|"is an approach to truth or goodness. And so, when Butler or Plato"|FALSE
39064|"distinguishes reason or reflection from appetites and affections, and even"|FALSE
39064|"from self-love or from the heart which loves and hates, this is not"|FALSE
39064|"exactly a psychological division in the narrower sense. That is to say:"|FALSE
39064|"these are, in Plato’s words, not merely “parts,” but quite as much “kinds”"|FALSE
39064|"and “forms” of soul. They denote degrees in that harmonisation of mind and"|FALSE
39064|"soul which reproduces the permanent and complete truth of things. For"|FALSE
39064|"example, self-love, as Butler describes it, has but a partial and narrowed"|FALSE
39064|"view of the worth of acts: it is engrossing and self-involved: it cannot"|FALSE
39064|"take in the full dependence of the narrower interest on the larger and"|FALSE
39064|"eternal self. So, in Plato, the man of heart is but a nature which by fits"|FALSE
39064|"and starts, or with steady but limited vision, realises the larger life."|FALSE
39064|"These parts or kinds are not separate and co-existent faculties: but"|FALSE
39064|"grades in the co-ordination and unification of the same one human nature."|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Psychology and Epistemology."|FALSE
39064|"Psychology however in the strict sense is extremely difficult to define."|FALSE
39064|"Those who describe it as the “science of mind,” the “phenomenology of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness,” seem to give it a wider scope than they really mean. The"|FALSE
39064|"psychologist of the straiter sect tends, on the other hand, to carry us"|FALSE
39064|"beyond mind and consciousness altogether. His, it has been said, is a"|FALSE
39064|"psychology without a Psyché. For him Mind, Soul, and Consciousness are"|FALSE
39064|"only current and convenient names to designate the field, the ground on"|FALSE
39064|"which the phenomena he observes are supposed to transact themselves. But"|FALSE
39064|"they must not on any account interfere with the operations; any more than"|FALSE
39064|"Nature in general may interfere with strictly physical inquiries, or Life"|FALSE
39064|"and vital force with the theories of biology. The so-called Mind is only"|FALSE
39064|"to be regarded as a stage on which certain events represent themselves. In"|FALSE
39064|"this field, or on this stage, there are certain relatively ultimate"|FALSE
39064|"elements, variously called ideas, presentations, feelings, or states of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness. But these elements, though called ideas, must not be"|FALSE
39064|"supposed more than mechanical or dynamical elements; consciousness is"|FALSE
39064|"rather their product, a product which presupposes certain operations and"|FALSE
39064|"relations between them. If we are to be strictly scientific, we must, it"|FALSE
39064|"is urged, treat the factors of consciousness as not themselves conscious:"|FALSE
39064|"we must regard them as quasi-objective, or in abstraction from the"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness which surveys them. The Ego must sink into a mere receptacle"|FALSE
39064|"or arena of psychic event; its independent meaning or purport is to be"|FALSE
39064|"ignored, as beside the question."|FALSE
39064|"When this line is once fixed upon, it seems inevitable to go farther."|FALSE
39064|"Comte was inclined to treat psychology as falling between two stools: it"|FALSE
39064|"must, he thought, draw all its content either from physiology on the one"|FALSE
39064|"hand, or from social factors on the other. The dominant or experimental"|FALSE
39064|"psychology of the present day seems inclined, without however formulating"|FALSE
39064|"any very definite statement, to pronounce for the former alternative. It"|FALSE
39064|"does not indeed adopt the materialistic view that mind is only a function"|FALSE
39064|"of matter. Its standpoint rather is that the psychical presents itself"|FALSE
39064|"even to unskilled observation as dependent on (i.e. not independent of) or"|FALSE
39064|"as concomitant with certain physical or corporeal facts. It adds that the"|FALSE
39064|"more accurately trained the observer becomes, the more he comes to"|FALSE
39064|"discover a corporeal aspect even where originally he had not surmised its"|FALSE
39064|"existence, and to conclude that the two cycles of psychical and physical"|FALSE
39064|"event never interfere with each other: that soul does not intervene in"|FALSE
39064|"bodily process, nor body take up and carry on psychical. If it is said"|FALSE
39064|"that the will moves the limbs, he replies that the will which moves is"|FALSE
39064|"really certain formerly unnoticed movements of nerve and muscle which are"|FALSE
39064|"felt or interpreted as a discharge of power. If the ocular impression is"|FALSE
39064|"said to cause an impression on the mind, he replies that any fact hidden"|FALSE
39064|"under that phrase refers to a change in the molecules of the brain. He"|FALSE
39064|"will therefore conclude that for the study of psychical phenomena the"|FALSE
39064|"physical basis, as it may be called, is all important. Only so can"|FALSE
39064|"observation really deal with fact capable of description and measurement."|FALSE
39064|"Thus psychology, it may be said, tends to become a department of"|FALSE
39064|"physiology. From another standpoint, biology may be said to receive its"|FALSE
39064|"completion in psychology. How much either phrase means, however, will"|FALSE
39064|"depend on the estimate we form of biology. If biology is only the study of"|FALSE
39064|"mechanical and chemical phenomena on the peculiar field known as an"|FALSE
39064|"organism, and if that organism is only treated as an environment which may"|FALSE
39064|"be ignored, then psychology, put on the same level, is not the full"|FALSE
39064|"science of mind, any more than the other is the full study of life. They"|FALSE
39064|"both have narrowed their subject to suit the abstract scheme of the"|FALSE
39064|"laboratory, where the victim of experiment is either altered by mutilation"|FALSE
39064|"and artificial restrictions, or is dead. If, on the contrary, biology has"|FALSE
39064|"a substantial unity of its own to which mechanical and chemical"|FALSE
39064|"considerations are subordinate and instrumental, psychology may even take"|FALSE
39064|"part with physiology without losing its essential rank. But in that case,"|FALSE
39064|"we must, as Spinoza said(47), think less mechanically of the animal frame,"|FALSE
39064|"and recognise (after the example of Schelling) something truly inward"|FALSE
39064|"(i.e. not merely locally inside the skin) as the supreme phase or"|FALSE
39064|"characteristic of life. We must, in short, recognise sensibility as the"|FALSE
39064|"culmination of the physiological and the beginning of the psychological."|FALSE
39064|"To the strictly scientific psychologist, as has been noted—or to the"|FALSE
39064|"psychology which imitates optical and electrical science—ideas are only"|FALSE
39064|"psychical events: they are not ideas _of_ anything, relative, i.e. to"|FALSE
39064|"something else; they have no meaning, and no reference to a reality beyond"|FALSE
39064|"themselves. They are presentations;—not representations of something"|FALSE
39064|"outside consciousness. They are appearances: but not appearances of"|FALSE
39064|"something: they do not reveal anything beyond themselves. They are, we may"|FALSE
39064|"almost say, a unique kind of physical phenomena. If we say they are"|FALSE
39064|"presentations of something, we only mean that in the presented something,"|FALSE
39064|"in the felt something, the wished something, we separate the quality or"|FALSE
39064|"form or aspect of presentativeness, of feltness, of wishedness, and"|FALSE
39064|"consider this aspect by itself. There are grades, relations,"|FALSE
39064|"complications, of such presentations or in such presentedness: and with"|FALSE
39064|"the description and explanation of these, psychology is concerned. They"|FALSE
39064|"are fainter or stronger, more or less correlated and antithetical."|FALSE
39064|"Presentation (or ideation), in short, is the name of a train of event,"|FALSE
39064|"which has its peculiarities, its laws, its systems, its history."|FALSE
39064|"All reality, it may be said, subsists in such presentation; it is for a"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness, or in a consciousness. All _esse_, in its widest sense, is"|FALSE
39064|"_percipi_. And yet, it seems but the commonest of experiences to say that"|FALSE
39064|"all that is presented is not reality. It _is_, it has a sort of being,—is"|FALSE
39064|"somehow presumed to exist: but it is not reality. And this reference and"|FALSE
39064|"antithesis to _what_ is presented is implied in all such terms as “ideas,”"|FALSE
39064|"“feelings,” “states of consciousness”: they are distinguished from and"|FALSE
39064|"related to objects of sense or external facts, to something, as it is"|FALSE
39064|"called, outside consciousness. Thoughts and ideas are set against things"|FALSE
39064|"and realities. In their primitive stage both the child and the savage seem"|FALSE
39064|"to recognise no such difference. What they imagine is, as we might say, on"|FALSE
39064|"the same plane with what they touch and feel. They do not, as we"|FALSE
39064|"reproachfully remark, recognise the difference between fact and fiction."|FALSE
39064|"All of us indeed are liable to lapses into the same condition. A strong"|FALSE
39064|"passion, a keen hope or fear, as we say, invests its objects with reality:"|FALSE
39064|"even a sanguine moment presents as fact what calmer reflection disallows"|FALSE
39064|"as fancy. With natural and sane intelligences, however, the recrudescence"|FALSE
39064|"of barbarous imagination is soon dispelled, and the difference between"|FALSE
39064|"hallucinations and realities is established. With the utterly wrecked in"|FALSE
39064|"mind, the reality of hallucinations becomes a permanent or habitual state."|FALSE
39064|"With the child and the untrained it is a recurrent and a disturbing"|FALSE
39064|"influence: and it need hardly be added that the circle of these _decepti"|FALSE
39064|"deceptores_—people with the “lie in the Soul”—is a large one. There thus"|FALSE
39064|"emerges a distinction of vast importance, that of truth and falsehood, of"|FALSE
39064|"reality and unreality, or between representation and reality. There arise"|FALSE
39064|"two worlds, the world of ideas, and the world of reality which it is"|FALSE
39064|"supposed to represent, and, in many cases, to represent badly."|FALSE
39064|"With this distinction we are brought across the problem sometimes called"|FALSE
39064|"Epistemological. Strictly speaking, it is really part of a larger problem:"|FALSE
39064|"the problem of what—if Greek compounds must be used—may be styled"|FALSE
39064|"Aletheiology—the theory of truth and reality: what Hegel called Logic, and"|FALSE
39064|"what many others have called Metaphysics. As it is ordinarily taken up,"|FALSE
39064|"“ideas” are believed to be something _in us_ which is representative or"|FALSE
39064|"symbolical of something truly real _outside us_. This inward something is"|FALSE
39064|"said to be the first and immediate object of knowledge(48), and gives"|FALSE
39064|"us—in a mysterious way we need not here discuss—the mediate knowledge of"|FALSE
39064|"the reality, which is sometimes said to cause it. Ideas in the Mind, or in"|FALSE
39064|"the Subject, or in us, bear witness to something outside the"|FALSE
39064|"mind,—trans-subjective—beyond us. The Mind, Subject, or Ego, in this"|FALSE
39064|"parallelism is evidently in some way identified with our corporeal"|FALSE
39064|"organism: perhaps even located, and provided with a “seat,” in some"|FALSE
39064|"defined space of that organism. It is, however, the starting-point of the"|FALSE
39064|"whole distinction that ideas _do not_, no less than they do, conform or"|FALSE
39064|"correspond to this supra-conscious or extra-conscious world of real"|FALSE
39064|"things. Truth or falsehood arises, according to these assumptions,"|FALSE
39064|"according as psychical image or idea corresponds or not to physical fact."|FALSE
39064|"But how, unless by some miraculous second-sight, where the supreme"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness, directly contemplating by intuition the true and"|FALSE
39064|"independent reality, turns to compare with this immediate vision the"|FALSE
39064|"results of the mediate processes conducted along the organs of sense,—how"|FALSE
39064|"this agreement or disagreement of copy and original, of idea and reality,"|FALSE
39064|"can be detected, it is impossible to say."|FALSE
39064|"As has been already noted, the mischief lies in the hypostatisation of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas as something existing in abstraction from things—and, of things, in"|FALSE
39064|"abstraction from ideas. They are two abstractions, the first by the"|FALSE
39064|"realist, the second by the idealist called subjective and psychological."|FALSE
39064|"To the realist, things exist by themselves, and they manage to produce a"|FALSE
39064|"copy of themselves (more or less exact, or symbolical) in _our_ mind, i.e."|FALSE
39064|"in a materialistically-spiritual or a spiritualistically-material locus"|FALSE
39064|"which holds “images” and ideas. To the psychological idealist, ideas have"|FALSE
39064|"a substantive and primary right to existence, them alone do we really"|FALSE
39064|"know, and from them we more or less legitimately are said (but probably no"|FALSE
39064|"one takes this seriously) to infer or postulate a world of permanent"|FALSE
39064|"things. Now ideas have no substantive existence as a sort of things, or"|FALSE
39064|"even images of things anywhere. All this is pure mythology. It is said by"|FALSE
39064|"comparative mythologists that in some cases the epithet or quality of some"|FALSE
39064|"deity has been substantialised (hypostatised) into a separate god, who,"|FALSE
39064|"however (so still to keep up the unity), is regarded as a relative, a son,"|FALSE
39064|"or daughter, of the original. So the phrase “ideas of things” has been"|FALSE
39064|"taken literally as if it was double. But to have an idea of a thing merely"|FALSE
39064|"means that we know it, or think it. An idea is not given: it is a thing"|FALSE
39064|"which is given in the idea. An idea is not an additional and intervening"|FALSE
39064|"object of our knowledge or supposed knowledge. That a thing is our object"|FALSE
39064|"of thought is another word for its being our idea, and that means we know"|FALSE
39064|"it."|FALSE
39064|"The distinction between truth and falsehood, between reality and"|FALSE
39064|"appearance, is not arrived at by comparing what we have before us in our"|FALSE
39064|"mind with some inaccessible reality beyond. It is a distinction that grows"|FALSE
39064|"up with the growth and organisation of our presentations—with their"|FALSE
39064|"gradual systematisation and unification in one consciousness. But this"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness which thinks, i.e. judges and reasons, is something superior"|FALSE
39064|"to the contrast of physical and psychical: superior, i.e. in so far as it"|FALSE
39064|"includes and surveys the antithesis, without superseding it. It is the"|FALSE
39064|"“transcendental unity of consciousness” of Kant—his synthetic unity of"|FALSE
39064|"apperception. It means that all ideas ultimately derive their reality from"|FALSE
39064|"their coherence with each other in an all-embracing or infinite idea. Real"|FALSE
39064|"in a sense ideas always are, but with an imperfect reality. Thus the"|FALSE
39064|"education to truth is not—such a thing would be meaningless—ended by a"|FALSE
39064|"rough and ready recommendation to compare our ideas with facts: it must"|FALSE
39064|"teach the art which discovers facts. And the teaching may have to go"|FALSE
39064|"through many grades or provinces: in each of which it is possible to"|FALSE
39064|"acquire a certain virtuosoship without being necessarily an adept in"|FALSE
39064|"another. It is through what is called the development of intellect,"|FALSE
39064|"judgment, and reasoning that the faculty of truth-detecting or"|FALSE
39064|"truth-selecting comes. And the common feature of all of these is, so to"|FALSE
39064|"say, their superiority to the psychological mechanism, not in the sense of"|FALSE
39064|"working without it and directly, but of being the organising unity or"|FALSE
39064|"unifier and controller and judge of that mechanism. The certainty and"|FALSE
39064|"necessity of truth and knowledge do not come from a constraint from the"|FALSE
39064|"external thing which forces the inner idea into submission; they come from"|FALSE
39064|"the inner necessity of conformity and coherence in the organism of"|FALSE
39064|"experience. We in fact had better speak of ideas as experience—as felt"|FALSE
39064|"reality: a reality however which has its degrees and perhaps even its"|FALSE
39064|"provinces. All truth comes with the reasoned judgment, i.e. the"|FALSE
39064|"syllogism—i.e. with the institution or discovery of relations of fact or"|FALSE
39064|"element to fact or element, immediate or derivative, partial and less"|FALSE
39064|"partial, up to its ideal coherence in one Idea. It is because this"|FALSE
39064|"coherence is so imperfectly established in many human beings that their"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge is so indistinguishable from opinion, and that they separate so"|FALSE
39064|"loosely truth from error. They have not worked their way into a definitely"|FALSE
39064|"articulated system, where there are no gaps, no abrupt transitions: their"|FALSE
39064|"mental order is so loosely put together that divergences and"|FALSE
39064|"contradictions which vex another drop off ineffectual from them."|FALSE
39064|"(ii.) Kant, Fichte, and Hegel."|FALSE
39064|"This was the idealism which Kant taught and Fichte promoted. Of the other"|FALSE
39064|"idealism there are no doubt abundant traces in the language of Kant: and"|FALSE
39064|"they were greedily fastened on by Schopenhauer. To him the doctrine, that"|FALSE
39064|"the world is my idea, is adequately represented when it is translated into"|FALSE
39064|"the phrase that the world is a phantasmagoria of my brain; and escape from"|FALSE
39064|"the subjective idealism thus initiated is found by him only through a"|FALSE
39064|"supposed revelation of immediate being communicated in the experience of"|FALSE
39064|"will. But according to the more consistently interpreted Kant, the problem"|FALSE
39064|"of philosophy consists in laying bare the supreme law or conditions of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness on which depend the validity of our knowledge, our estimates"|FALSE
39064|"of conduct, and our aesthetic standards. And these roots of reality are"|FALSE
39064|"for Kant in the mind—or, should we rather say—in mind—in “Consciousness in"|FALSE
39064|"General.” In the _Criticism of Pure Reason_ the general drift of his"|FALSE
39064|"examination is to show that the great things or final realities which are"|FALSE
39064|"popularly supposed to stand in self-subsistent being, as ultimate and"|FALSE
39064|"all-comprehensive objects set up for knowledge, are not “things” as"|FALSE
39064|"popularly supposed, but imperative and inevitable ideas. They are not"|FALSE
39064|"objects to be known—(these are always finite): but rather the unification,"|FALSE
39064|"the basis, or condition, and the completion of all knowledge. To know"|FALSE
39064|"them—in the ordinary petty sense of knowledge—is as absurd and impossible"|FALSE
39064|"as it would be, in the Platonic scheme of reality, to know the idea of"|FALSE
39064|"good which is “on the further side of knowledge and being.” God and the"|FALSE
39064|"Soul—and the same would be true of the World (though modern speculators"|FALSE
39064|"sometimes talk as if they had it at least within their grasp)—are not mere"|FALSE
39064|"_objects_ of knowledge. It would be truer to say they are that by which we"|FALSE
39064|"know, and they are what in us knows: they make knowledge possible, and"|FALSE
39064|"actual. Kant has sometimes spoken of them as the objects of a faith of"|FALSE
39064|"reason. What he means is that reason only issues in knowledge because of"|FALSE
39064|"and through this inevitable law of reason bidding us go on for ever in our"|FALSE
39064|"search, because there can be nothing isolated and nowhere any _ne plus"|FALSE
39064|"ultra_ in science, which is infinite and yet only justified as it"|FALSE
39064|"postulates or commands unity."|FALSE
39064|"Kant’s central idea is that truth, beauty, goodness, are not dependent on"|FALSE
39064|"some qualities of the object, but on the universal nature or law of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness. Beauty is not an attribute of things in their abstractness:"|FALSE
39064|"but of things as ideas of a subject, and depends on the proportion and"|FALSE
39064|"symmetry in the play of human faculty. Goodness is not conformity to an"|FALSE
39064|"outward law, but is obligatory on us through that higher nature which is"|FALSE
39064|"our truer being. Truth is not conformity of ideas with supposed"|FALSE
39064|"trans-subjective things, but coherence and stability in the system of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas. The really infinite world is not out there, but in here—in"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness in general, which is the denial of all limitation, of all"|FALSE
39064|"finality, of all isolation. God is the essential and inherent unity and"|FALSE
39064|"unifier of spirit and nature—the surety that the world in all its"|FALSE
39064|"differentiations is one. The Soul is not an essential entity, but the"|FALSE
39064|"infinite fruitfulness and freshness of mental life, which forbids us"|FALSE
39064|"stopping at anything short of complete continuity and unity. The Kingdom"|FALSE
39064|"of God—the Soul—the moral law—is within us: within us, as supreme,"|FALSE
39064|"supra-personal and infinite intelligences, even amid all our littleness"|FALSE
39064|"and finitude. Even happiness which we stretch our arms after is not really"|FALSE
39064|"beyond us, but is the essential self which indeed we can only reach in"|FALSE
39064|"detail. It is so both in knowledge and in action. Each knowledge and"|FALSE
39064|"enjoyment in reality is limited and partial, but it is made stable, and it"|FALSE
39064|"gets a touch of infinitude, by the larger idea which it helps to realise."|FALSE
39064|"Only indeed in that antithesis between the finite and the infinite does"|FALSE
39064|"the real live. Every piece of knowledge is real, only because it assumes"|FALSE
39064|"_pro tempore_ certain premisses which are given: every actual beauty is"|FALSE
39064|"set in some defect of aesthetic completeness: every actually good deed has"|FALSE
39064|"to get its foil in surrounding badness. The real is always partial and"|FALSE
39064|"incomplete. But it has the basis or condition of its reality in an idea—in"|FALSE
39064|"a transcendental unity of consciousness, which is so to say a law, or a"|FALSE
39064|"system and an order, which imposes upon it the condition of conformity and"|FALSE
39064|"coherence; but a conformity which is essential and implicit in it."|FALSE
39064|"Fichte has called his system a _Wissenschaftslehre_—a theory of knowledge."|FALSE
39064|"Modern German used the word _Wissenschaft_, as modern English uses the"|FALSE
39064|"word Science, to denote the certified knowledge of piecemeal fact, the"|FALSE
39064|"partial unification of elements still kept asunder. But by _Wissen_, as"|FALSE
39064|"opposed to _Erkennen_, is meant the I know, am aware and sure, am in"|FALSE
39064|"contact with reality, as opposed to the derivative and conditional"|FALSE
39064|"reference of something to something else which explains it. The former is"|FALSE
39064|"a wider term: it denotes all consciousness of objective truth, the"|FALSE
39064|"certainty which claims to be necessary and universal, which pledges its"|FALSE
39064|"whole self for its assertion. Fichte thus unifies and accentuates the"|FALSE
39064|"common element in the Kantian criticisms. In the first of these Kant had"|FALSE
39064|"begun by explaining the nature and limitation of empirical science. It was"|FALSE
39064|"essentially conditioned by the given sensation—dependent i.e. on an"|FALSE
39064|"unexplained and preliminary element. This is what makes it science in the"|FALSE
39064|"strict or narrow sense of the term: its being set, as it were, in the"|FALSE
39064|"unknown, the felt, the sense-datum. The side of reality is thus the side"|FALSE
39064|"of limitation and of presupposition. But what makes it truth and knowledge"|FALSE
39064|"in general, on the other hand,—as distinct from _a_ truth (i.e. partial"|FALSE
39064|"truth) and a knowledge,—is the ideal element—the mathematical, the"|FALSE
39064|"logical, the rational law,—or in one word, the universal and formal"|FALSE
39064|"character. So too every real action is on one hand the product of an"|FALSE
39064|"impulse, a dark, merely given, immediate tendency to be, and without that"|FALSE
39064|"would be nothing: but on the other hand it is only an intelligent and"|FALSE
39064|"moral action in so far as it has its constitution from an intelligence, a"|FALSE
39064|"formal system, which determine its place and function."|FALSE
39064|"It is on the latter or ideal element that Kant makes the emphasis"|FALSE
39064|"increasingly turn. Not truths, duties, beauties, but truth, duty, beauty,"|FALSE
39064|"form his theme. The formal element—the logical or epistemological"|FALSE
39064|"condition of knowledge and morality and of beauty—is what he (and still"|FALSE
39064|"more Fichte) considers the prime question of fundamental philosophy. His"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy is an attempt to get at the organism of our fundamental"|FALSE
39064|"belief—the construction, from the very base, of our conception of reality,"|FALSE
39064|"of our primary certainty. In technical language, he describes our"|FALSE
39064|"essential nature as a Subject-object. It is the unity of an I am which is"|FALSE
39064|"also I know that I am: an I will which is also I am conscious of my"|FALSE
39064|"will(49). Here there is a radical disunion and a supersession of that"|FALSE
39064|"disunion. Action and contemplation are continually outrunning each other."|FALSE
39064|"The I will rests upon one I know, and works up to another: the I know"|FALSE
39064|"reflects upon an I will, and includes it as an element in its idea."|FALSE
39064|"Kant had brought into use the term Deduction, and Fichte follows him. The"|FALSE
39064|"term leads to some confusion: for in English, by its modern antithesis to"|FALSE
39064|"induction, it suggests _a priori_ methods in all their iniquity. It means"|FALSE
39064|"a kind of jugglery which brings an endless series out of one small term."|FALSE
39064|"Kant has explained that he uses it in the lawyer’s sense in which a claim"|FALSE
39064|"is justified by being traced step by step back to some acknowledged and"|FALSE
39064|"accepted right(50). It is a regressive method which shows us that if the"|FALSE
39064|"original datum is to be accepted it carries along with it the legitimation"|FALSE
39064|"of the consequence. This method Fichte applies to psychology. Begin, he"|FALSE
39064|"says like Condillac, with the barest nucleus of soul-life; the mere"|FALSE
39064|"sentiency, or feeling: the contact, as it were, with being, at a single"|FALSE
39064|"point. But such a mere point is unthinkable. You find, as Mr. Spencer"|FALSE
39064|"says, that “Thought” (or Consciousness) “cannot be framed out of one term"|FALSE
39064|"only.” “Every sensation to be known as one must be perceived.” Such is the"|FALSE
39064|"nature of the Ego—a subject which insists on each part being qualified by"|FALSE
39064|"the whole and so transformed. As Mr. Spencer, again, puts it, the mind not"|FALSE
39064|"merely tends to revive, to associate, to assimilate, to represent its own"|FALSE
39064|"presentations, but it carries on this process infinitely and in ever"|FALSE
39064|"higher multiples. Ideas as it were are growing in complexity by"|FALSE
39064|"re-presenting: i.e. by embracing and enveloping elements which cannot be"|FALSE
39064|"found existing in separation. In the mind there is no mere presentation,"|FALSE
39064|"no bare sensation. Such a unit is a fiction or hypothesis we employ, like"|FALSE
39064|"the atom, for purposes of explanation. The pure sensation therefore—which"|FALSE
39064|"you admit because you must have something to begin with, not a mere"|FALSE
39064|"nothing, but something so simple that it seems to stand out clear and"|FALSE
39064|"indisputable—this pure sensation, when you think of it, forces you to go a"|FALSE
39064|"good deal further. Even to be itself, it must be more than itself. It is"|FALSE
39064|"like the pure or mere being of the logicians. Admit the simple"|FALSE
39064|"sensation—and you have admitted everything which is required to make"|FALSE
39064|"sensation a possible reality. But you do not—in the sense of vulgar"|FALSE
39064|"logic—deduce what follows out of the beginning. From that, taken by"|FALSE
39064|"itself, you will get only itself: mere being will give you only nothing,"|FALSE
39064|"to the end of the chapter. But, as the phrase is, sensation is an element"|FALSE
39064|"in a consciousness: it is, when you think of it, always more than you"|FALSE
39064|"called it: there is a curious “continuity” about the phenomena, which"|FALSE
39064|"makes real isolation impossible."|FALSE
39064|"Of course this “deduction” is not history: it is logic. It says, if you"|FALSE
39064|"posit sensation, then in doing so, you posit a good deal more. You have"|FALSE
39064|"imagination, reason, and many more, all involved in your original"|FALSE
39064|"assumption. And there is a further point to be noted. You cannot really"|FALSE
39064|"stop even at reason, at intelligence and will, if you take these in the"|FALSE
39064|"full sense. You must realise that these only exist as part and parcel of a"|FALSE
39064|"reasonable world. An individual intelligence presupposes a society of"|FALSE
39064|"intelligences. The successive steps in this argument are presented by"|FALSE
39064|"Fichte in the chief works of his earlier period (1794-98). The works of"|FALSE
39064|"that period form a kind of trilogy of philosophy, by which the faint"|FALSE
39064|"outlines of the absolute selfhood is shown acquiring definite consistency"|FALSE
39064|"in the moral organisation of society. First comes the “Foundation for the"|FALSE
39064|"collective philosophy.” It shows how our conception of reality and our"|FALSE
39064|"psychical organisation are inevitably presupposed in the barest function"|FALSE
39064|"of intelligence, in the abstractest forms of logical law. Begin where you"|FALSE
39064|"like, with the most abstract and formal point of consciousness, you are"|FALSE
39064|"forced, as you dwell upon it (you identifying yourself with the thought"|FALSE
39064|"you realise), to go step by step on till you accept as a self-consistent"|FALSE
39064|"and self-explanatory unity all that your cognitive and volitional nature"|FALSE
39064|"claims to own as its birthright. Only in such an intelligent will is"|FALSE
39064|"perception and sensation possible. Next came the “Foundation of Natural"|FALSE
39064|"Law, on the principles of the general theory.” Here the process of"|FALSE
39064|"deduction is carried a step further. If man is to realise himself as an"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence with an inherent bent to action, then he must be conceived as"|FALSE
39064|"a person among persons, as possessed of rights, as incapable of acting"|FALSE
39064|"without at the same moment claiming for his acts recognition, generality,"|FALSE
39064|"and logical consecution. The reference, which in the conception of a"|FALSE
39064|"practical intelligence was implicit,—the reference to fellow-agents, to a"|FALSE
39064|"world in which law rules—is thus, by the explicit recognition of these"|FALSE
39064|"references, made a fact patent and positive—_gesetzt_,—expressly"|FALSE
39064|"instituted in the way that the nature and condition of things postulates."|FALSE
39064|"But this is not all: we step from the formal and absolute into the"|FALSE
39064|"material and relative. If man is to be a real intelligence, he must be an"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence served by organs. “The rational being cannot realise its"|FALSE
39064|"efficient individuality, unless it ascribes to itself a material body”: a"|FALSE
39064|"body, moreover, in which Fichte believes he can show that the details of"|FALSE
39064|"structure and organs are equally with the general corporeity predetermined"|FALSE
39064|"by reason(51). In the same way it is shown that the social and political"|FALSE
39064|"organisation is required for the realisation—the making positive and yet"|FALSE
39064|"coherent—of the rights of all individuals. You deduce society by showing"|FALSE
39064|"it is required to make a genuine individual man. Thirdly came the “System"|FALSE
39064|"of Ethics.” Here it is further argued that, at least in a certain"|FALSE
39064|"respect(52), in spite of my absolute reason and my absolute freedom, I can"|FALSE
39064|"only be fully real as a part of Nature: that my reason is realised in a"|FALSE
39064|"creature of appetite and impulse. From first to last this deduction is one"|FALSE
39064|"process which may be said to have for its object to determine “the"|FALSE
39064|"conditions of self-hood or egoity.” It is the deduction of the concrete"|FALSE
39064|"and empirical moral agent—the actual ego of actual life—from the abstract,"|FALSE
39064|"unconditioned ego, which in order to be actual must condescend to be at"|FALSE
39064|"once determining and determined."|FALSE
39064|"In all of this Fichte makes—especially formally—a decided advance upon"|FALSE
39064|"Kant. In Ethics Kant in particular, (—especially for readers who never got"|FALSE
39064|"beyond the beginning of his moral treatise and were overpowered by the"|FALSE
39064|"categorical imperative of duty) had found the moral initiative or dynamic"|FALSE
39064|"apparently in the other world. The voice of duty seemed to speak from a"|FALSE
39064|"region outside and beyond the individual conscience. In a sense it must do"|FALSE
39064|"so: but it comes from a consciousness which is, and yet is more than, the"|FALSE
39064|"individual. It is indeed true that appearances here are deceptive: and"|FALSE
39064|"that the idea of autonomy, the self-legislation of reason, is trying to"|FALSE
39064|"become the central conception of Kant’s Ethics. Still it is Fichte’s merit"|FALSE
39064|"to have seen this clearly, to have held it in view unfalteringly, and to"|FALSE
39064|"have carried it out in undeviating system or deduction. Man, intelligent,"|FALSE
39064|"social, ethical, is a being all of one piece and to be explained entirely"|FALSE
39064|"immanently, or from himself. Law and ethics are no accident either to"|FALSE
39064|"sense or to intelligence—nothing imposed by mere external or supernal"|FALSE
39064|"authority(53). Society is not a brand-new order of things supervening upon"|FALSE
39064|"and superseding a state of nature, where the individual was entirely"|FALSE
39064|"self-supporting. Morals, law, society, are all necessary steps (necessary"|FALSE
39064|"i.e. in logic, and hence in the long run also inevitable in course of"|FALSE
39064|"time) to complete the full evolution or realisation of a human being. The"|FALSE
39064|"same conditions as make man intelligent make him social and moral. He does"|FALSE
39064|"not proceed so far as to become intelligent and practical, under terms of"|FALSE
39064|"natural and logical development, then to fall into the hands of a foreign"|FALSE
39064|"influence, an accident _ab extra_, which causes him to become social and"|FALSE
39064|"moral. Rather he is intelligent, because he is a social agent."|FALSE
39064|"Hence, in Fichte, the absence of the ascetic element so often stamping its"|FALSE
39064|"character on ethics, and representing the moral life as the enemy of the"|FALSE
39064|"natural, or as mainly a struggle to subdue the sensibility and the flesh."|FALSE
39064|"With Kant,—as becomes his position of mere inquirer—the sensibility has"|FALSE
39064|"the place of a predominant and permanent foreground. Reason, to his way of"|FALSE
39064|"talking, is always something of an intruder, a stranger from a far-off"|FALSE
39064|"world, to be feared even when obeyed: sublime, rather than beautiful. From"|FALSE
39064|"the land of sense which we habitually occupy, the land of reason is a"|FALSE
39064|"country we can only behold from afar: or if we can be said to have a"|FALSE
39064|"standpoint in it, that is only a figurative way of saying that though it"|FALSE
39064|"is really over the border, we can act—it would sometimes seem by a sort of"|FALSE
39064|"make-believe—as if we were already there. But these moments of high"|FALSE
39064|"enthusiasm are rare; and Kant commends sobriety and warns against"|FALSE
39064|"high-minded _Schwärmerei_, or over-strained Mysticism. For us it is"|FALSE
39064|"reserved to struggle with a recalcitrant selfhood, a grovelling"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility: it were only fantastic extravagance, fit for “fair souls” who"|FALSE
39064|"unfortunately often lapse into “fair sinners,” should we fancy ourselves"|FALSE
39064|"already anchored in the haven of untempted rest and peace."|FALSE
39064|"When we come to Fichte, we find another spirit breathing. We have passed"|FALSE
39064|"from the age of Frederick the Great to the age of the French Revolution;"|FALSE
39064|"and the breeze that burst in the War of Liberation is already beginning to"|FALSE
39064|"freshen the air. Boldly he pronounces the primacy of that faith of reason"|FALSE
39064|"whereby not merely the just but all shall live. Your will shall show you"|FALSE
39064|"what you really are. You are essentially a rational will, or a"|FALSE
39064|"will-reason. Your sensuous nature, of impulse and appetite, far from being"|FALSE
39064|"the given and found obstacle to the realisation of reason,—which Kant"|FALSE
39064|"strictly interpreted might sometimes seem to imply—(and in this point"|FALSE
39064|"Schopenhauer carries out the implications of Kant)—is really the condition"|FALSE
39064|"or mode of being which reason assumes, or rises up to, in order to be a"|FALSE
39064|"practical or moral being. Far from the body and the sensible needs being a"|FALSE
39064|"stumbling-block to hamper the free fullness of rationality and morality,"|FALSE
39064|"the truth rather is that it is only by body and sense, by flesh and blood,"|FALSE
39064|"that the full moral and rational life can be realised(54). Or, to put it"|FALSE
39064|"otherwise, if human reason (intelligence and will) is to be more than a"|FALSE
39064|"mere and empty inner possibility, if man is to be a real and concrete"|FALSE
39064|"cognitive and volitional being, he must be a member of an ethical and"|FALSE
39064|"actual society, which lives by bread, and which marries and has children."|FALSE
39064|"(iii.) Psychology in Ethics."|FALSE
39064|"In this way, for Fichte, and through Fichte still more decidedly for"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel, both psychology and ethics breathe an opener and ampler air than"|FALSE
39064|"they often enjoy. Psychology ceases to be a mere description of psychic"|FALSE
39064|"events, and becomes the history of the self-organising process of human"|FALSE
39064|"reason. Ethics loses its cloistered, negative, unnatural aspect, and"|FALSE
39064|"becomes a name for some further conditions of the same development,"|FALSE
39064|"essentially postulated to complete or supplement its shortcomings."|FALSE
39064|"Psychology—taken in this high philosophical acceptation—thus leads on to"|FALSE
39064|"Ethics; and Ethics is parted by no impassable line from Psychology. That,"|FALSE
39064|"at least, is what must happen if they are still to retain a place in"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy: for, as Kant says(55), “under the government of reason our"|FALSE
39064|"cognitions cannot form a rhapsody, but must constitute a system, in which"|FALSE
39064|"alone can they support and further its essential aims.” As parts of such a"|FALSE
39064|"system, they carry out their special work in subordination to, and in the"|FALSE
39064|"realisation of, a single Idea—and therefore in essential interconnexion."|FALSE
39064|"From that interconnecting band we may however in detail-enquiry dispense"|FALSE
39064|"ourselves; and then we have the empirical or inductive sciences of"|FALSE
39064|"psychology and ethics. But even with these, the necessity of the situation"|FALSE
39064|"is such that it is only a question of degree how far we lose sight of the"|FALSE
39064|"philosophical horizon, and entrench ourselves in special enquiry."|FALSE
39064|"Something of the philosophic largeness must always guide us; even when, to"|FALSE
39064|"further the interests of the whole, it is necessary for the special"|FALSE
39064|"enquirer to bury himself entirely in his part. So long as each part is"|FALSE
39064|"sincerely and thoroughly pursued, and no part is neglected, there is an"|FALSE
39064|"indwelling reason in the parts which will in the long run tend to"|FALSE
39064|"constitute the total."|FALSE
39064|"A philosophical psychology will show us how the sane intelligence and the"|FALSE
39064|"rational will are, at least approximately, built up out of elements, and"|FALSE
39064|"through stages and processes, which modify and complement, as they may"|FALSE
39064|"also arrest and perplex, each other. The unity, coherence, and"|FALSE
39064|"completeness of the intelligent self is not, as vulgar irreflectiveness"|FALSE
39064|"supposes and somewhat angrily maintains, a full-grown thing or agent, of"|FALSE
39064|"whose actions and modes of behaviour the psychologist has to narrate the"|FALSE
39064|"history,—a history which is too apt to degenerate into the anecdotal and"|FALSE
39064|"the merely interesting. This unity of self has to be “deduced,” as Fichte"|FALSE
39064|"would say: it has to be shown as the necessary result which certain"|FALSE
39064|"elements in a certain order will lead to(56). A normal mind,"|FALSE
39064|"self-possessed, developed and articulated, yet thoroughly one, a real"|FALSE
39064|"microcosm, or true and full monad, which under the mode of its"|FALSE
39064|"individuality still represents the universe: that is, what psychology has"|FALSE
39064|"to show as the product of factors and processes. And it is clearly"|FALSE
39064|"something great and good, something valuable, and already possessing, by"|FALSE
39064|"implication we may say, an ethical character."|FALSE
39064|"In philosophy, at least, it is difficult, or rather impossible to draw a"|FALSE
39064|"hard and fast line which shall demarcate ethical from non-ethical"|FALSE
39064|"characters,—to separate them from other intellectual and reasonable"|FALSE
39064|"motives. Kant, as we know, attempted to do so: but with the result that he"|FALSE
39064|"was forced to add a doubt whether a purely moral act could ever be said to"|FALSE
39064|"exist(57); or rather to express the certainty that if it did it was for"|FALSE
39064|"ever inaccessible to observation. All such designations of the several"|FALSE
39064|"“factors” or “moments” in reality, as has been hinted, are only _a"|FALSE
39064|"potiori_. But they are misused when it is supposed that they connote"|FALSE
39064|"abrupt and total discontinuity. And Kant, after all, only repeated in his"|FALSE
39064|"own terminology an old and inveterate habit of thought:—the habit which in"|FALSE
39064|"Stoicism seemed to see sage and foolish utterly separated, and which in"|FALSE
39064|"the straiter sects of Christendom fenced off saint absolutely from sinner."|FALSE
39064|"It is a habit to which Hegel, and even his immediate predecessors, are"|FALSE
39064|"radically opposed. With Herder, he might say, “Ethics is only a higher"|FALSE
39064|"physics of the mind(58).” This—the truth in Spinozism—no doubt demands"|FALSE
39064|"some emphasis on the word “higher”: and it requires us to read ethics (or"|FALSE
39064|"something like it) into physics; but it is a step on the right road,—the"|FALSE
39064|"step which Utilitarianism and Evolutionism had (however awkwardly) got"|FALSE
39064|"their foot upon, and which “transcendent” ethics seems unduly afraid of"|FALSE
39064|"committing itself to. Let us say, if we like, that the mind is more than"|FALSE
39064|"mere nature, and that it is no proper object of a merely natural science."|FALSE
39064|"But let us remember that a merely natural science is only a fragment of"|FALSE
39064|"science: let us add that the _merely_ natural is an abstraction which in"|FALSE
39064|"part denaturalises and mutilates the larger nature—a nature which includes"|FALSE
39064|"the natural mind, and cannot altogether exclude the ethical."|FALSE
39064|"What have been called “formal duties(59)” seem to fall under this"|FALSE
39064|"range—the province of a philosophical psychology which unveils the"|FALSE
39064|"conditions of personality. Under that heading may be put self-control,"|FALSE
39064|"consistency, resolution, energy, forethought, prudence, and the like. The"|FALSE
39064|"due proportion of faculty, the correspondence of head and heart, the"|FALSE
39064|"vivacity and quickness of sympathy, the ease and simplicity of mental"|FALSE
39064|"tone, the due vigour of memory and the grace of imagination, sweetness of"|FALSE
39064|"temper, and the like, are parts of the same group(60). They are lovely,"|FALSE
39064|"and of good report: they are praise and virtue. If it be urged that they"|FALSE
39064|"are only natural gifts and graces, that objection cuts two ways. The"|FALSE
39064|"objector may of course be reminded that religion tones down the"|FALSE
39064|"self-complacency of morality. Yet, first, even apart from that, it may be"|FALSE
39064|"said that of virtues, which stand independent of natural conditions—of"|FALSE
39064|"external supply of means (as Aristotle would say)—nothing can be known and"|FALSE
39064|"nothing need be said. And secondly, none of these qualities are mere"|FALSE
39064|"gifts;—all require exercise, habituation, energising, to get and keep"|FALSE
39064|"them. How much and how little in each case is nature’s and how much ours"|FALSE
39064|"is a problem which has some personal interest—due perhaps to a rather"|FALSE
39064|"selfish and envious curiosity. But on the broad field of experience and"|FALSE
39064|"history we may perhaps accept the—apparently one-sided—proverb that “Each"|FALSE
39064|"man is the architect of his own fortune.” Be this as it may, it will not"|FALSE
39064|"do to deny the ethical character of these “formal duties” on the ground"|FALSE
39064|"e.g. that self-control, prudence, and even sweetness of temper may be used"|FALSE
39064|"for evil ends,—that one may smile and smile, and yet be a villain."|FALSE
39064|"That—let us reply,—on one hand, is a fault (if fault it be) incidental to"|FALSE
39064|"all virtues in detail (for every single quality has its defect): nay it"|FALSE
39064|"may be a limitation attaching to the whole ethical sphere: and, secondly,"|FALSE
39064|"its inevitable limitation does not render the virtue in any case one whit"|FALSE
39064|"less genuine so far as it goes. And yet of such virtues it may be said, as"|FALSE
39064|"Hume(61) would say (who calls them “natural,” as opposed to the more"|FALSE
39064|"artificial merits of justice and its kin), that they please in themselves,"|FALSE
39064|"or in the mere contemplation, and without any regard to their social"|FALSE
39064|"effects. But they please as entering into our idea of complete human"|FALSE
39064|"nature, of mind and spirit as will and intellect."|FALSE
39064|"The moralists of last century sometimes divided the field of ethics by"|FALSE
39064|"assigning to man three grades or kinds of duty: duties to himself, duties"|FALSE
39064|"to society, and duties to God. For the distinction there is a good deal to"|FALSE
39064|"be said: there are also faults to be found with it. It may be said,"|FALSE
39064|"amongst other things, that to speak of duties to self is a metaphorical"|FALSE
39064|"way of talking, and that God lies out of the range of human duty"|FALSE
39064|"altogether, except in so far as religious service forms a part of social"|FALSE
39064|"obligation. It may be urged that man is essentially a social being, and"|FALSE
39064|"that it is only in his relations to other such beings that his morality"|FALSE
39064|"can find a sphere. The sphere of morality, according to Dr. Bain, embraces"|FALSE
39064|"whatever “society has seen fit to enforce with all the rigour of positive"|FALSE
39064|"inflictions. Positive good deeds and self-sacrifice ... transcend the"|FALSE
39064|"region of morality proper and occupy a sphere of their own(62).” And there"|FALSE
39064|"is little doubt that this restriction is in accordance with a main current"|FALSE
39064|"of usage. It may even be said that there are tendencies towards a narrower"|FALSE
39064|"usage still, which would restrict the term to questions affecting the"|FALSE
39064|"relations of the sexes. But, without going so far, we may accept the"|FALSE
39064|"standpoint which finds in the phrase “popular or social” sanction, as"|FALSE
39064|"equivalent to the moral sanction, a description of the average level of"|FALSE
39064|"common opinion on the topic. The morality of an age or country thus"|FALSE
39064|"denotes, first, the average requirement in act and behaviour imposed by"|FALSE
39064|"general consent on the members of a community, and secondly, the average"|FALSE
39064|"performance of the members in response to these requirements. Generally"|FALSE
39064|"speaking the two will be pretty much the same. If the society is in a"|FALSE
39064|"state of equilibrium, there will be a palpable agreement between what all"|FALSE
39064|"severally expect and what all severally perform. On the other hand, as no"|FALSE
39064|"society is ever in complete equilibrium, this harmony will never be"|FALSE
39064|"perfect and may often be widely departed from. In what is called a single"|FALSE
39064|"community, if it reach a considerable bulk, there are (in other words)"|FALSE
39064|"often a number of minor societies, more or less thwarting and modifying"|FALSE
39064|"each other; and different observers, who belong in the main to one or"|FALSE
39064|"other of these subordinate groups, may elicit from the facts before them a"|FALSE
39064|"somewhat different social code, and a different grade of social"|FALSE
39064|"observance. Still, with whatever diversity of detail, the important"|FALSE
39064|"feature of such social ethics is that the stress is laid on the"|FALSE
39064|"performance of certain acts, in accordance with the organisation of"|FALSE
39064|"society. So long as the required compliance is given, public opinion is"|FALSE
39064|"satisfied, and morality has got its due."|FALSE
39064|"But in two directions this conception of morality needs to be"|FALSE
39064|"supplementing. There is, on one hand, what is called duty to God. The"|FALSE
39064|"phrase is not altogether appropriate: for it follows too closely the"|FALSE
39064|"analogy of social requirement, and treats Deity as an additional and"|FALSE
39064|"social authority,—a lord paramount over merely human sovereigns. But"|FALSE
39064|"though there may be some use in the analogy, to press the conception is"|FALSE
39064|"seriously to narrow the divine character and the scope of religion. As in"|FALSE
39064|"similar cases, we cannot change one term without altering its correlative."|FALSE
39064|"And therefore to describe our relation to God under the name of duty is to"|FALSE
39064|"narrow and falsify that relation. The word is no longer applicable in this"|FALSE
39064|"connexion without a strain, and where it exists it indicates the survival"|FALSE
39064|"of a conception of theocracy: of God regarded as a glorification of the"|FALSE
39064|"magistrate, as king of kings and lord of lords. It is the social world—and"|FALSE
39064|"indeed we may say the outside of the social world—that is the sphere of"|FALSE
39064|"duties. Duty is still with these reductions a great august name: but in"|FALSE
39064|"literal strictness it only rules over the medial sphere of life, the"|FALSE
39064|"sphere which lies between the individual as such and his universal"|FALSE
39064|"humanity(63). Beyond duty, lies the sphere of conscience and of religion."|FALSE
39064|"And that is not the mere insistence by the individual to have a voice and"|FALSE
39064|"a vote in determining the social order. It is the sense that the social"|FALSE
39064|"order, however omnipotent it may seem, is limited and finite, and that man"|FALSE
39064|"has in him a kindred with the Eternal."|FALSE
39064|"It is not very satisfactory, either, as Aristotle and others have pointed"|FALSE
39064|"out, to speak of man’s duties to himself. The phrase is analogical, like"|FALSE
39064|"the other. But it has the merit, like that of duty to God, of reminding us"|FALSE
39064|"that the ordinary latitude occupied by morality is not all that comes"|FALSE
39064|"under the larger scope of ethics. The “ethics of individual life” is a"|FALSE
39064|"subject which Mr. Spencer has touched upon: and by this title, he means"|FALSE
39064|"that, besides his general relationship to others, a human being has to"|FALSE
39064|"mind his own health, food, and amusement, and has duties as husband and"|FALSE
39064|"parent. But, after all, these are not matters of peculiarly individual"|FALSE
39064|"interest. They rather refer to points which society at certain epochs"|FALSE
39064|"leaves to the common sense of the agent,—apparently on an assumption that"|FALSE
39064|"he is the person chiefly interested. And these points—as the Greeks taught"|FALSE
39064|"long ago—are of fundamental importance: they are the very bases of life."|FALSE
39064|"Yet the comparative neglect in which so-called civilised societies(64)"|FALSE
39064|"hold the precepts of wisdom in relation to bodily health and vigour, in"|FALSE
39064|"regard to marriage and progeny, serve to illustrate the doctrine of the"|FALSE
39064|"ancient Stoics that πάντα ὑπόληψις, or the modern idealist utterance that"|FALSE
39064|"the World is my idea. More and more as civilisation succeeds in its"|FALSE
39064|"disruption of man from nature, it shows him governed not by bare facts and"|FALSE
39064|"isolated experiences, but by the systematic idea under which all things"|FALSE
39064|"are subsumed. He loses the naïveté of the natural man, which takes each"|FALSE
39064|"fact as it came, all alike good: he becomes sentimental, and artificial,"|FALSE
39064|"sees things under a conventional point of view, and would rather die than"|FALSE
39064|"not be in the fashion. And this tendency is apparently irresistible. Yet"|FALSE
39064|"the mistake lies in the one-sidedness of sentiment and convention. Not the"|FALSE
39064|"domination of the idea is evil; but the domination of a partial and"|FALSE
39064|"fragmentary idea: and this is what constitutes the evil of artificiality."|FALSE
39064|"And the correction must lie not in a return to nature, but in the"|FALSE
39064|"reconstruction of a wider and more comprehensive idea: an idea which shall"|FALSE
39064|"be the unity and system of all nature; not a fantastic idealism, but an"|FALSE
39064|"attempt to do justice to the more realist as well as the idealist sides of"|FALSE
39064|"life."|FALSE
39064|"There is however another side of individualist ethics which needs even"|FALSE
39064|"more especial enforcement. It is the formation of"|FALSE
39064|"    “The reason firm, the temperate will,"|FALSE
39064|"    Endurance, foresight, strength and skill:”"|FALSE
39064|"the healthy mind in a healthy body. Ethics is only too apt to suppose that"|FALSE
39064|"will and intelligence are assumptions which need no special justification."|FALSE
39064|"But the truth is that they vary from individual to individual in degree"|FALSE
39064|"and structure. It is the business of ethical psychology to give to these"|FALSE
39064|"vague attributions the definiteness of a normal standard: to show what"|FALSE
39064|"proportions are required to justify the proper title of reason and will—to"|FALSE
39064|"show what reason and will really are if they do what they are encouraged"|FALSE
39064|"or expected to do. It talks of the diseases of will and personality: it"|FALSE
39064|"must also set forth their educational ideal. The first problem of Ethics,"|FALSE
39064|"it may be said, is the question of the will and its freedom. But to say"|FALSE
39064|"this is of course not to say that, unless freedom of will be understood in"|FALSE
39064|"some special sense, ethics becomes impossible. If the moral law is the"|FALSE
39064|"_ratio cognoscendi_ of freedom, then must our conception of morality and"|FALSE
39064|"of freedom hang together. And it will clearly be indispensable to begin by"|FALSE
39064|"some attempt to discover in what sense man may be in the most general way"|FALSE
39064|"described as a moral agent—as an intelligent will, or (more briefly, yet"|FALSE
39064|"synonymously) as a will. “The soil of law and morality,” says Hegel(65),"|FALSE
39064|"“is the intelligent life: and its more precise place and starting-point"|FALSE
39064|"the will, which is free, in the sense that freedom is its substance and"|FALSE
39064|"characteristic, and the system of law the realm of freedom realised, the"|FALSE
39064|"world of intelligence produced out of itself as a second nature.” Such a"|FALSE
39064|"freedom is a freedom made and acquired, the work of the mind’s"|FALSE
39064|"self-realisation, not to be taken as a given fact of consciousness which"|FALSE
39064|"must be believed(66). To have a will—in other words, to have freedom, is"|FALSE
39064|"the consummation—and let us add, only the formal or ideal consummation—of"|FALSE
39064|"a process by which man raises himself out of his absorption in sensation"|FALSE
39064|"and impulse, establishes within himself a mental realm, an organism of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas, a self-consciousness, and a self."|FALSE
39064|"The vulgar apprehension of these things seems to assume that we have by"|FALSE
39064|"nature, or are born with, a general faculty or set of general faculties,"|FALSE
39064|"which we subsequently fill up and embody by the aid of experience. We"|FALSE
39064|"possess—they seem to imply—so many “forms” and “categories” latent in our"|FALSE
39064|"minds ready to hold and contain the raw materials supplied from without."|FALSE
39064|"According to this view we have all a will and an intelligence: the"|FALSE
39064|"difference only is that some put more into them, and some put less. But"|FALSE
39064|"such a separation of the general form from its contents is a piece of pure"|FALSE
39064|"mythology. It is perhaps true and safe to say that the human being is of"|FALSE
39064|"such a character that will and intelligence are in the ordinary course"|FALSE
39064|"inevitably produced. But the forms which grow up are the more and more"|FALSE
39064|"definite and systematic organisation of a graded experience, of series of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas, working themselves up again and again in representative and"|FALSE
39064|"re-representative degree, till they constitute a mental or inner world of"|FALSE
39064|"their own. The will is thus the title appropriate to the final stage of a"|FALSE
39064|"process, by which sensation and impulse have polished and perfected"|FALSE
39064|"themselves by union and opposition, by differentiation and accompanying"|FALSE
39064|"redintegration, till they assume characters quite unsurmised in their"|FALSE
39064|"earliest aspects, and yet only the consolidation or self-realisation of"|FALSE
39064|"implications. Thus the mental faculties are essentially acquired"|FALSE
39064|"powers,—acquired not from without, but by action which generates the"|FALSE
39064|"faculties it seems to imply. The process of mind is a process which"|FALSE
39064|"creates individual centres, raises them to completer independence;—which"|FALSE
39064|"produces an inner life more and more self-centered and also more and more"|FALSE
39064|"equal to the universe which it has embodied. And will and intelligence are"|FALSE
39064|"an important stage in that process."|FALSE
39064|"Herbart (as was briefly hinted at in the first essay) has analysed ethical"|FALSE
39064|"appreciation (which may or may not be accompanied by approbation) into"|FALSE
39064|"five distinct standard ideas. These are the ideas of inward liberty, of"|FALSE
39064|"perfection, of right, benevolence, and equity. Like Hume, he regards the"|FALSE
39064|"moral judgment as in its purity a kind of aesthetic pronouncement on the"|FALSE
39064|"agreement or proportion of certain activities in relations to each other."|FALSE
39064|"Two of these standard ideas,—that of inward liberty and of perfection—seem"|FALSE
39064|"to belong to the sphere at present under review. They emerge as conditions"|FALSE
39064|"determining the normal development of human nature to an intelligent and"|FALSE
39064|"matured personality. By inward freedom Herbart means the harmony between"|FALSE
39064|"the will and the intellect: what Aristotle has named “practical truth or"|FALSE
39064|"reality,” and what he describes in his conception of wisdom or moral"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence,—the power of discerning the right path and of pursuing it"|FALSE
39064|"with will and temper: the unity, clear but indissoluble, of will and"|FALSE
39064|"discernment. By the idea of perfection Herbart means the sense of"|FALSE
39064|"proportion and of propriety which is awakened by comparing a progress in"|FALSE
39064|"development or an increase in strength with its earlier stages of promise"|FALSE
39064|"and imperfection. The pleasure such perception affords works in two ways:"|FALSE
39064|"it is a satisfaction in achievement past, and a stimulus to achievement"|FALSE
39064|"yet to come."|FALSE
39064|"Such ideas of inward liberty and of growth in ability or in performance"|FALSE
39064|"govern (at least in part) our judgment of the individual, and have an"|FALSE
39064|"ethical significance. Indeed, if the cardinal feature of the ethical"|FALSE
39064|"sentiment be the inwardness and independence of its approbation and"|FALSE
39064|"obligation, these ideas lie at the root of all true morality. Inward"|FALSE
39064|"harmony and inward progress, lucidity of conscience and the resolution"|FALSE
39064|"which knows no finality of effort, are the very essence of moral life."|FALSE
39064|"Yet, if ethics is to include in the first instance social relationships"|FALSE
39064|"and external utilities and sanctions, these conditions of true life must"|FALSE
39064|"rather be described as pre-ethical. The truth seems to be that here we get"|FALSE
39064|"to a range of ethics which is far wider than what is ordinarily called"|FALSE
39064|"practice and conduct. At this stage logic, aesthetic, and ethic, are yet"|FALSE
39064|"one: the true, the good, and the beautiful are still held in their"|FALSE
39064|"fundamental unity. An ethics of wide principle precedes its narrower"|FALSE
39064|"social application; and whereas in ordinary usage the social provinciality"|FALSE
39064|"is allowed to prevail, here the higher ethics emerge clear and imperial"|FALSE
39064|"above the limitations of local and temporal duty."|FALSE
39064|"And though it is easy to step into exaggeration, it is still well to"|FALSE
39064|"emphasise this larger conception of ethics. The moral principle of the"|FALSE
39064|"“maximising of life,” as it has been called(67), may be open to"|FALSE
39064|"misconception (—so, unfortunately are all moral principles when stated in"|FALSE
39064|"the effrontery of isolation): but it has its truth in the conviction that"|FALSE
39064|"all moral evil is marked by a tendency to lower or lessen the total"|FALSE
39064|"vitality. So too Friedrich Nietzsche’s maxim, _Sei vornehm_(68), ensue"|FALSE
39064|"distinction, and above all things be not common or vulgar (_gemein_), will"|FALSE
39064|"easily lend itself to distortion. But it is good advice for all that, even"|FALSE
39064|"though it may be difficult to define in a general formula wherein"|FALSE
39064|"distinction consists, to mark the boundary between self-respect and vanity"|FALSE
39064|"or obstinacy, or to say wherein lies the beauty and dignity of human"|FALSE
39064|"nature. Kant has laid it down as the principle of duty to ask ourselves if"|FALSE
39064|"in our act we are prepared to universalise the maxim implied by our"|FALSE
39064|"conduct. And that this—which essentially bids us look at an act in the"|FALSE
39064|"whole of its relations and context—is a safeguard against some forms of"|FALSE
39064|"moral evil, is certain. But there is an opposite—or rather an apparently"|FALSE
39064|"opposite—principle which bids us be individual, be true to our own selves,"|FALSE
39064|"and never allow ourselves to be dismayed from our own unique"|FALSE
39064|"responsibility. Perhaps the two principles are not so far apart as they"|FALSE
39064|"seem. In any case true individuality is the last word and the first word"|FALSE
39064|"in ethics; though, it may be added, there is a good deal to be said"|FALSE
39064|"between the two termini."|FALSE
39064|"(iv.) An Excursus on Greek Ethics."|FALSE
39064|"It is in these regions that Greek ethics loves to linger; on the duty of"|FALSE
39064|"the individual to himself, to be perfectly lucid and true, and to rise to"|FALSE
39064|"ever higher heights of achievement. _Ceteris paribus_, there is felt to be"|FALSE
39064|"something meritorious in superiority, something good:—even were it that"|FALSE
39064|"you are master, and another is slave. Thus naïvely speaks Aristotle(69)."|FALSE
39064|"To a modern, set amid so many conflicting ideals, perhaps, the immense"|FALSE
39064|"possibilities of yet further growth might suggest themselves with"|FALSE
39064|"overpowering force. To him the idea of perfection takes the form of an"|FALSE
39064|"idea of perfectibility: and sometimes it smites down his conceit in what"|FALSE
39064|"he has actually done, and impresses a sense of humility in comparison with"|FALSE
39064|"what yet remains unaccomplished. An ancient Greek apparently was little"|FALSE
39064|"haunted by these vistas of possibilities of progress through worlds beyond"|FALSE
39064|"worlds. A comparatively simple environment, a fixed and definite mental"|FALSE
39064|"horizon, had its plain and definite standards, or at least seemed to have"|FALSE
39064|"such. There were fewer cases of the man, unattached or faintly attached to"|FALSE
39064|"any definite profession—moving about in worlds half realised—who has grown"|FALSE
39064|"so common in a more developed civilisation. The ideals of the Greek were"|FALSE
39064|"clearly descried: each man had his definite function or work to perform:"|FALSE
39064|"and to do it better than the average, or than he himself habitually had"|FALSE
39064|"done, that was perfection, excellence, virtue. For virtue to the Greek is"|FALSE
39064|"essentially ability and respectability: promise of excellent performance:"|FALSE
39064|"capacity to do better than others. Virtue is praiseworthy or meritorious"|FALSE
39064|"character and quality: it is achievement at a higher rate, as set against"|FALSE
39064|"one’s past and against others’ average."|FALSE
39064|"The Greek moralists sometimes distinguish and sometimes combine moral"|FALSE
39064|"virtue and wisdom, ἀρετή and φρόνησις: capacity to perform, and wisdom to"|FALSE
39064|"guide that capacity. To the ordinary Greek perhaps the emphasis fell on"|FALSE
39064|"the former, on the attainment of all recognised good quality which became"|FALSE
39064|"a man, all that was beautiful and honourable, all that was appropriate,"|FALSE
39064|"glorious, and fame-giving; and that not for any special reference to its"|FALSE
39064|"utilitarian qualities. Useful, of course, such qualities were: but that"|FALSE
39064|"was not in question at the time. In the more liberal commonwealths of"|FALSE
39064|"ancient Greece there was little or no anxious care to control the"|FALSE
39064|"education of its citizens, so as to get direct service, overt contribution"|FALSE
39064|"to the public good. A suspicious Spartan legislation might claim to do"|FALSE
39064|"that. But in the free air of Athens all that was required was loyalty,"|FALSE
39064|"good-will—εὔνοια—to the common weal; it might be even a sentiment of human"|FALSE
39064|"kindliness, of fraternity of spirit and purpose. Everything beyond and"|FALSE
39064|"upon that basis was left to free development. Let each carry out to the"|FALSE
39064|"full the development of his powers in the line which national estimation"|FALSE
39064|"points out. He is—nature and history alike emphasise that fact beyond the"|FALSE
39064|"reach of doubt, for all except the outlaw and the casual stranger—a member"|FALSE
39064|"of a community, and as such has a governing instinct and ideal which"|FALSE
39064|"animates him. But he is also a self-centered individual, with special"|FALSE
39064|"endowments of nature, in his own person and in the material objects which"|FALSE
39064|"are his. A purely individualist or selfish use of them is not—to the"|FALSE
39064|"normal Greek—even dreamed of. He is too deeply rooted in the substance of"|FALSE
39064|"his community for that: or it is on the ground and in the atmosphere of an"|FALSE
39064|"assured community that his individuality is to be made to flourish. Nature"|FALSE
39064|"has secured that his individuality shall rest securely in the"|FALSE
39064|"presupposition of his citizenship. It seems, therefore, as if he were left"|FALSE
39064|"free and independent in his personal search for perfection, for"|FALSE
39064|"distinction. His place is fixed for him: _Spartam nactus es; hanc orna_:"|FALSE
39064|"his duty is his virtue. That duty, as Plato expresses it, is to do his own"|FALSE
39064|"deeds—and not meddle with others. Nature and history have arranged that"|FALSE
39064|"others, in other posts, shall do theirs: that all severally shall energise"|FALSE
39064|"their function. The very word “duty” seems out of place; if, at least,"|FALSE
39064|"duty suggests external obligation, an order imposed and a debt to be"|FALSE
39064|"discharged. If there be a task-master and a creditor, it is the inflexible"|FALSE
39064|"order of nature and history:—or, to be more accurate, of nature, the"|FALSE
39064|"indwelling and permanent reality of things. But the obligation to follow"|FALSE
39064|"nature is scarcely felt as a yoke of constraint. A man’s virtue is to"|FALSE
39064|"perform his work and to perform it well: to do what he is specially"|FALSE
39064|"capable of doing, and therefore specially charged to do."|FALSE
39064|"Nowhere has this character of Greek ethics received more classical"|FALSE
39064|"expression than in the Republic of Plato. In the prelude to his"|FALSE
39064|"subject—which is the nature of Right and Morality—Plato has touched"|FALSE
39064|"briefly on certain popular and inadequate views. There is the view that"|FALSE
39064|"Right has its province in performance of certain single and external"|FALSE
39064|"acts—in business honesty and commercial straightforwardness. There is the"|FALSE
39064|"view that it is rendering to each what is due to him; that it consists in"|FALSE
39064|"the proper reciprocity of services, in the balance of social give and"|FALSE
39064|"take. There is the critical or hyper-critical view which, from seeing so"|FALSE
39064|"much that is called justice to be in harmony with the interest of the"|FALSE
39064|"predominant social order, bluntly identifies mere force or strength as the"|FALSE
39064|"ground of right. And there are views which regard it as due to social"|FALSE
39064|"conventions and artifices, to the influence of education, to political"|FALSE
39064|"arrangements and the operation of irrational prejudices. To all these"|FALSE
39064|"views Plato objects: not because they are false—for they are all in part,"|FALSE
39064|"often in large part, true—but because they are inadequate and do not go to"|FALSE
39064|"the root of the matter. The foundations of right lie, he says, not in"|FALSE
39064|"external act, but in the inner man: not in convention, but in nature: not"|FALSE
39064|"in relation to others, but in the constitution of the soul itself. That"|FALSE
39064|"ethical idea—the idea of right—which seems most obviously to have its"|FALSE
39064|"centre outside the individual, to live and grow only in the relations"|FALSE
39064|"between individuals, Plato selects in order to show the independent"|FALSE
39064|"royalty of the single human soul. The world, as Hume afterwards, called"|FALSE
39064|"justice artificial: Plato will prove it natural. In a way he joins company"|FALSE
39064|"with those who bid us drive out the spectre of duty, of obligation coming"|FALSE
39064|"upon the soul from social authority, from traditional idea, from religious"|FALSE
39064|"sanctions. He preaches—or he is about to preach—the autonomy of the will."|FALSE
39064|"The four cardinal virtues of Plato’s list are the qualities which go to"|FALSE
39064|"make a healthy, normal, natural human soul, fit for all activity, equipped"|FALSE
39064|"with all arms for the battle of life. They tell us what such a soul is,"|FALSE
39064|"not what it does. They are the qualities which unless a soul has, and has"|FALSE
39064|"them each perfect, yet all co-operant, its mere outward and single acts"|FALSE
39064|"have no virtue or merit, but are only lucky accidents at the best. On the"|FALSE
39064|"other hand, if a man has these constitutive qualities, he will act in the"|FALSE
39064|"social world, and act well. Plato has said scornful things of mere outward"|FALSE
39064|"and verbal truthfulness, and has set at the very lowest pitch of"|FALSE
39064|"degradation the “lie in the soul.” His “temperance” or “self-restraint,”"|FALSE
39064|"if it be far from breathing any suggestion of self-suppression or"|FALSE
39064|"self-assertion, is still farther from any suspicion of asceticism, or war"|FALSE
39064|"against the flesh. It is the noble harmony of the ruling and the ruled,"|FALSE
39064|"which makes the latter a partner of the sovereign, and takes from the"|FALSE
39064|"dictates of the ruler any touch of coercion. It is literally sanity of"|FALSE
39064|"soul, integrity and purity of spirit; it is what has been sometimes called"|FALSE
39064|"the beautiful soul—the indiscerptible unity of reason and impulse. Plato’s"|FALSE
39064|"bravery, again, is fortitude and consistency of soul, the full-blooded"|FALSE
39064|"heart which is fixed in reason, the zeal which is according to knowledge,"|FALSE
39064|"unflinching loyalty to the idea, the spirit which burns in the martyrs to"|FALSE
39064|"truth and humanity: yet withal with gentleness and courtesy and noble"|FALSE
39064|"urbanity in its immediate train. And his truthfulness is that inner"|FALSE
39064|"lucidity which cannot be self-deceived, the spirit which is a safeguard"|FALSE
39064|"against fanaticism and hypocrisy, the sunlike warmth of intelligence"|FALSE
39064|"without which the heart is a darkness full of unclean things."|FALSE
39064|"The full development and crowning grace of such a manly nature Aristotle"|FALSE
39064|"has tried to present in the character of the Great-souled man—him whom"|FALSE
39064|"Plato has called the true king by divine right, or the autocrat by the"|FALSE
39064|"patent of nature. Like all such attempts to delineate a type in the terms"|FALSE
39064|"necessarily single and successive of abstract analysis, it tends"|FALSE
39064|"occasionally to run into caricature, and to give partial aspects an absurd"|FALSE
39064|"prominency. Only the greatest of artists could cope with such a task,"|FALSE
39064|"though that artist may be found perhaps classed among the historians. Yet"|FALSE
39064|"it is possible to form some conception of the ideal which Aristotle would"|FALSE
39064|"set before us. The Great-souled man _is_ great, and he dare not deny the"|FALSE
39064|"witness of his spirit. He is one who does not quail before the anger and"|FALSE
39064|"seek the applause of popular opinion: he holds his head as his own, and as"|FALSE
39064|"high as his undimmed self-consciousness shows it is worth. There has been"|FALSE
39064|"said to him by the reason within him the word that Virgil erewhile"|FALSE
39064|"addressed to Dante:"|FALSE
39064|"    “Libero, dritto, e sano è il tuo arbitrio"|FALSE
39064|"    E fallo fora non fare a suo cenno;"|FALSE
39064|"    Per ch’ io te sopra te corono e mitrio.”"|FALSE
39064|"He is his own Emperor and his own Pope. He is the perfected man, in whom"|FALSE
39064|"is no darkness, whose soul is utter clearness, and complete harmony. Calm"|FALSE
39064|"in self-possessed majesty, he stands, if need be, _contra mundum_: but"|FALSE
39064|"rather, with the world beneath his feet. The chatter of personality has no"|FALSE
39064|"interest for him. Bent upon the best, lesser competitions for distinction"|FALSE
39064|"have no attraction for him. To the vulgar he will seem cold,"|FALSE
39064|"self-confined: in his apartness and distinction they will see the signs of"|FALSE
39064|"a “prig.” His look will be that of one who pities men—rather than loves"|FALSE
39064|"them: and should he speak ill of a foe, it is rather out of pride of heart"|FALSE
39064|"and unbroken spirit than because these things touch him. Such an one, in"|FALSE
39064|"many ways, was the Florentine poet himself."|FALSE
39064|"If the Greek world in general thus conceived ἀρετή as the full bloom of"|FALSE
39064|"manly excellence (we all know how slightly—witness the remarks in the"|FALSE
39064|"Periclean oration—Greeks, in their public and official utterances, rated"|FALSE
39064|"womanliness), the philosophers had a further point to emphasise. That was"|FALSE
39064|"what they variously called knowledge, prudence, reason, insight,"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence, wisdom, truth. From Socrates to Aristotle, from Aristotle to"|FALSE
39064|"the Stoics and Epicureans, and from the Stoics to the Neo-Platonists, this"|FALSE
39064|"is the common theme: the supremacy of knowledge, its central and essential"|FALSE
39064|"relation to virtue. They may differ—perhaps not so widely as current"|FALSE
39064|"prejudice would suppose—as to how this knowledge is to be defined, what"|FALSE
39064|"kind of knowledge it is, how acquired and maintained, and so on. But in"|FALSE
39064|"essentials they are at one. None of them, of course, mean that in order to"|FALSE
39064|"right conduct nothing more is needed than to learn and remember what is"|FALSE
39064|"right, the precepts and commandments of ordinary morality. Memory is not"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge, especially when it is out of mind. Even an ancient philosopher"|FALSE
39064|"was not wholly devoid of common sense. They held—what they supposed was a"|FALSE
39064|"fact of observation and reflection—that all action was prompted by"|FALSE
39064|"feelings of the values of things, by a desire of something good or"|FALSE
39064|"pleasing to self, and aimed at self-satisfaction and self-realisation, but"|FALSE
39064|"that there was great mistake in what thus afforded satisfaction. People"|FALSE
39064|"chose to act wrongly or erroneously, because they were, first, mistaken"|FALSE
39064|"about themselves and what they wanted, and, secondly, mistaken in the"|FALSE
39064|"means which would give them satisfaction. But this second point was"|FALSE
39064|"secondary. The main thing was to know yourself, what you really were; in"|FALSE
39064|"Plato’s words, to “see the soul as it is, and know whether it have one"|FALSE
39064|"form only or many, or what its nature is; to look upon it with the eye of"|FALSE
39064|"reason in its original purity.” Self-deception, confusion, that worst"|FALSE
39064|"ignorance which is unaware of itself, false estimation—these are the"|FALSE
39064|"radical evils of the natural man. To these critics the testimony of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness was worthless, unless corroborated. To cure this mental"|FALSE
39064|"confusion, this blindness of will and judgment, is the task set for"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy: to give inward light, to teach true self-measurement. In one"|FALSE
39064|"passage, much misunderstood, Plato has called this philosophic art the due"|FALSE
39064|"measurement of pleasures and pains. It should scarcely have been possible"|FALSE
39064|"to mistake the meaning. But, with the catchwords of Utilitarianism ringing"|FALSE
39064|"in their ears, the commentators ran straight contrary to the true teaching"|FALSE
39064|"of the _Protagoras_, consentient as it is with that of the _Phaedo_ and"|FALSE
39064|"the _Philebus_. To measure, one must have a standard: and if Plato has one"|FALSE
39064|"lesson always for us, it is that a sure standard the multitude have not,"|FALSE
39064|"but only confusion. The so-called pleasures and pains of the world’s"|FALSE
39064|"experiences are so entitled for different reasons, for contrary aims, and"|FALSE
39064|"with no unity or harmony of judgment. They are—not a fact to be accepted,"|FALSE
39064|"but—a problem for investigation: their reality is in question, their"|FALSE
39064|"genuineness, solidity and purity: and till you have settled that, you"|FALSE
39064|"cannot measure, for you may be measuring vacuity under the idea that there"|FALSE
39064|"is substance. You have still to get at the unit—i.e. the reality of"|FALSE
39064|"pleasure. It was not Plato’s view that pleasure was a separate and"|FALSE
39064|"independent entity: that it was exactly as it was felt. Each pleasure is"|FALSE
39064|"dependent for its pleasurable quality on the consciousness it belongs to,"|FALSE
39064|"and has only a relative truth and reality. Bentham has written about"|FALSE
39064|"computing the value of a “lot” of pleasures and pains. But Plato had his"|FALSE
39064|"mind on an earlier and more fundamental problem, what is the truth and"|FALSE
39064|"reality of pleasure; and his fullest but not his only essay towards"|FALSE
39064|"determining the value or estimating the meaning of pleasure in the scale"|FALSE
39064|"of being is that given in the _Philebus_."|FALSE
39064|"This then is the knowledge which Greek philosophy meant: not mere"|FALSE
39064|"intellect—though, of course, there is always a danger of theoretical"|FALSE
39064|"inquiry degenerating into abstract and formal dogma. But of the meaning"|FALSE
39064|"there can be no serious doubt. It is a knowledge, says Plato, to which the"|FALSE
39064|"method of mathematical science—the most perfect he can find"|FALSE
39064|"acknowledged—is only an _ouverture_, or perhaps, only the preliminary"|FALSE
39064|"tuning of the strings. It is a knowledge not eternally hypothetical—a"|FALSE
39064|"system of sequences which have no sure foundation. It is a knowledge which"|FALSE
39064|"rests upon the conviction and belief of the “idea of good”: a kind of"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge which does not come by direct teaching, which is not mere"|FALSE
39064|"theory, but implies a lively conviction, a personal apprehension, a crisis"|FALSE
39064|"which is a kind of “conversion,” or “inspiration.” It is as it were the"|FALSE
39064|"prize of a great contest, in which the sword that conquers is the sword of"|FALSE
39064|"dialectic: a sword whereof the property is, like that of Ithuriel’s spear,"|FALSE
39064|"to lay bare all deceptions and illusions of life. Or, to vary the"|FALSE
39064|"metaphor: the son of man is like the prince in the fairy tale who goes"|FALSE
39064|"forth to win the true queen; but there are many false pretenders decked"|FALSE
39064|"out to deceive his unwary eyes and foolish heart. Yet in himself there is"|FALSE
39064|"a power of discernment: there is something kindred with the truth:—the"|FALSE
39064|"witness of the Spirit—and all that education and discipline can do is to"|FALSE
39064|"remove obstacles, especially the obstacles within the self which perturb"|FALSE
39064|"the sight and mislead the judgment. Were not the soul originally possessed"|FALSE
39064|"of and dominated by the idea of good, it could never discern it elsewhere."|FALSE
39064|"On this original kindred depends all the process of education; the"|FALSE
39064|"influence of which therefore is primarily negative or auxiliary. Thus the"|FALSE
39064|"process of history and experience,—which the work of education only"|FALSE
39064|"reproduces in an accelerated _tempo_—serves but to bring out the implicit"|FALSE
39064|"reason within into explicit conformity with the rationality of the world."|FALSE
39064|"Knowledge, then, in this ethical sphere means the harmony of will,"|FALSE
39064|"emotion, intellect: it means the clear light which has no illusions and no"|FALSE
39064|"deceptions. And to those who feel that much of their life and of the"|FALSE
39064|"common life is founded on prejudice and illusion, such white light will"|FALSE
39064|"occasionally seem hard and steely. At its approach they fear the loss of"|FALSE
39064|"the charm of that twilight hour ere the day has yet begun, or before the"|FALSE
39064|"darkness has fully settled down. Thus the heart and feelings look upon the"|FALSE
39064|"intellect as an enemy of sentiment. And Plato himself is not without"|FALSE
39064|"anticipations of such an issue. Yet perhaps we may add that the danger is"|FALSE
39064|"in part an imaginary one, and only arises because intelligence takes its"|FALSE
39064|"task too lightly, and encroaches beyond its proper ground. Philosophy, in"|FALSE
39064|"other words, mistakes its place when it sets itself up as a dogmatic"|FALSE
39064|"system of life. Its function is to comprehend, and from comprehension to"|FALSE
39064|"criticise, and through criticising to unify. It has no positive and"|FALSE
39064|"additional teaching of its own: no addition to the burden of life and"|FALSE
39064|"experience. And experience it must respect. Its work is to maintain the"|FALSE
39064|"organic or super-organic interconnexion between all the spheres of life"|FALSE
39064|"and all the forms of reality. It has to prevent stagnation and absorption"|FALSE
39064|"of departments—to keep each in its proper place, but not more than its"|FALSE
39064|"place, and yet to show how each is not independent of the others. And this"|FALSE
39064|"is what the philosopher or ancient sage would be. If he is passionless, it"|FALSE
39064|"is not that he has no passions, but that they no longer perturb and"|FALSE
39064|"mislead. If his controlling spirit be reason, it is not the reason of the"|FALSE
39064|"so-called “rationalist,” but the reason which seeks in patience to"|FALSE
39064|"comprehend, and to be at home in, a world it at first finds strange. And"|FALSE
39064|"if he is critical of others, he is still more critical of himself:"|FALSE
39064|"critical however not for criticism’s sake (which is but a poor thing), but"|FALSE
39064|"because through criticism the faith of reason may be more fully justified."|FALSE
39064|"To the last, if he is true to his mission and faithful to his loyalty to"|FALSE
39064|"reality, he will have the simplicity of the child."|FALSE
39064|"Whether therefore we agree or not with Plato’s reduction of Right and Duty"|FALSE
39064|"to self-actualisation, we may at least admit that in the idea of"|FALSE
39064|"perfection or excellence, combined with the idea of knowledge or inward"|FALSE
39064|"lucidity, he has got the fundamental ideas on which further ethical"|FALSE
39064|"development must build. Self-control, self-knowledge, internal harmony,"|FALSE
39064|"are good: and so are the development of our several faculties and of the"|FALSE
39064|"totality of them to the fullest pitch of excellence. But their value does"|FALSE
39064|"not lie entirely in themselves, or rather there is implicit in them a"|FALSE
39064|"reference to something beyond themselves. They take for granted something"|FALSE
39064|"which, because it is so taken, may also be ignored and neglected, just"|FALSE
39064|"because it seems so obvious. And that implication is the social humanity"|FALSE
39064|"in which they are the spirits of light and leading."|FALSE
39064|"To lay the stress on ἀρετή or excellence tends to leave out of sight the"|FALSE
39064|"force of duty; and to emphasise knowledge is allowed to disparage the"|FALSE
39064|"heart and feelings. The mind—even of a philosopher—finds a difficulty in"|FALSE
39064|"holding very different points of view in one, and where it is forced from"|FALSE
39064|"one to another, tends to forget the earlier altogether. Thus when the"|FALSE
39064|"ethical philosopher, presupposing as an absolute or unquestionable fact"|FALSE
39064|"that man the individual was rooted in the community, proceeded to discuss"|FALSE
39064|"the problem of the best and completest individual estate, he was easily"|FALSE
39064|"led to lose sight of the fundamental and governing condition altogether."|FALSE
39064|"From the moment that Aristotle lays down the thesis that man is naturally"|FALSE
39064|"social, to the moment when he asks how the bare ideal of excellence in"|FALSE
39064|"character and life can become an actuality, the community in which man"|FALSE
39064|"lives has retired out of sight away into the background. And it only comes"|FALSE
39064|"in, as it first appears, as the paedagogue to bring us to morality. And"|FALSE
39064|"Plato, though professedly he is speaking of the community, and is well"|FALSE
39064|"aware that the individual can only be saved by the salvation of the"|FALSE
39064|"community, is constantly falling back into another problem—the development"|FALSE
39064|"of an individual soul. He feels the strength of the egoistic effort after"|FALSE
39064|"perfection, and his essay in the end tends to lose sight altogether of its"|FALSE
39064|"second theme. Instead of a man he gives us a mere philosopher, a man, that"|FALSE
39064|"is, not living with his country’s life, instinct with the heart and"|FALSE
39064|"feeling of humanity, inspired by art and religion, but a being set apart"|FALSE
39064|"and exalted above his fellows,—charged no doubt in theory with the duty of"|FALSE
39064|"saving them, of acting vicariously as the mediator between them and the"|FALSE
39064|"absolute truth—but really tending more and more to seclude himself on the"|FALSE
39064|"_edita templa_ of the world, on the high-towers of speculation."|FALSE
39064|"And what Plato and Aristotle did, so to speak, against their express"|FALSE
39064|"purpose and effort, yet did, because the force of contemporary tendency"|FALSE
39064|"was irresistible—that the Stoa and Epicurus did more openly and"|FALSE
39064|"professedly. With a difference in theory, it is true, owing to the"|FALSE
39064|"difference in the surroundings. Virtue in the older day of the free and"|FALSE
39064|"glorious commonwealth had meant physical and intellectual achievement,"|FALSE
39064|"acts done in the public eye, and of course for the public good—a good with"|FALSE
39064|"which the agent was identified at least in heart and soul, if not in his"|FALSE
39064|"explicit consciousness. In later and worse days, when the political world,"|FALSE
39064|"with the world divine, had withdrawn from actual identity with the central"|FALSE
39064|"heart of the individual, and stood over-against him as a strange power and"|FALSE
39064|"little better than a nuisance, virtue came to be counted as endurance,"|FALSE
39064|"indifference, negative independence against a cold and a perplexing world."|FALSE
39064|"But even still, virtue is excellence: it is to rise above the ignoble"|FALSE
39064|"level: to assert self-liberty against accident and circumstance—to attain"|FALSE
39064|"self-controlled, self-satisfying independence—and to become God-like in"|FALSE
39064|"its seclusion. Yet in two directions even it had to acknowledge something"|FALSE
39064|"beyond the individual. The Epicurean—following out a suggestion of"|FALSE
39064|"Aristotle—recognised the help which the free society of friends gave to"|FALSE
39064|"the full development of the single seeker after a self-satisfying and"|FALSE
39064|"complete life. The Stoic, not altogether refusing such help, tended rather"|FALSE
39064|"to rest his single self on a fellowship of ideal sort, on the great city"|FALSE
39064|"of gods and men, the _civitas Dei_. Thus, in separate halves, the two"|FALSE
39064|"schools, into which Greek ethics was divided, gave expression to the sense"|FALSE
39064|"that a new and higher community was needed—to the sense that the visible"|FALSE
39064|"actual community no longer realised its latent idea. The Stoic emphasised"|FALSE
39064|"the all-embracing necessity, the absolute comprehensiveness of the moral"|FALSE
39064|"kingdom. The Epicurean saw more clearly that, if the everlasting city came"|FALSE
39064|"from heaven, it could only visibly arise by initiation upon the earth."|FALSE
39064|"Christianity—in its best work—was a conjunction of the liberty with the"|FALSE
39064|"necessity, of the human with the divine."|FALSE
39064|"More interesting, perhaps, it is to note the misconception of reason and"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge which grew up. Knowledge came more and more to be identified"|FALSE
39064|"with the reflective and critical consciousness, which is outside reality"|FALSE
39064|"and life, and judges it from a standpoint of its own. It came to be"|FALSE
39064|"esteemed only in its formal and abstract shape, and at the expense of the"|FALSE
39064|"heart and feelings. The antithesis of philosophy (or knowledge strictly so"|FALSE
39064|"called) according to Plato was mere opinion, accidental and imperfect"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge. The knowledge which is truly valuable is a knowledge which"|FALSE
39064|"presupposes the full reality of life, and is the more and more completely"|FALSE
39064|"articulated theory of it as a whole. It is—abstractly taken—a mere form of"|FALSE
39064|"unity which has no value except in uniting: it is—taken concretely—the"|FALSE
39064|"matter, we may say, in complete unity. It is ideal and perfect harmony of"|FALSE
39064|"thought, appetite, and emotion: or putting it otherwise, the philosopher"|FALSE
39064|"is one who is not merely a creature of appetite and production, not merely"|FALSE
39064|"a creature of feeling and practical energy, but a creature, who to both of"|FALSE
39064|"these superadds an intelligence which sets eyes in the blind forehead of"|FALSE
39064|"these other powers, and thus, far from superseding them altogether, only"|FALSE
39064|"raises them into completeness, and realises all that is worthy in their"|FALSE
39064|"implicit natures. Always these two impulsive tendencies of our nature are"|FALSE
39064|"guided by some sort of ideas and intelligence, by beliefs and opinions."|FALSE
39064|"But they, like their guides, are sporadically emergent, unconnected, and"|FALSE
39064|"therefore apt to be contradictory. It is to such erratic and occasional"|FALSE
39064|"ideas, half-truths and deceptions, that philosophy is opposed."|FALSE
39064|"Unfortunately for all parties, the antithesis is carried farther."|FALSE
39064|"Philosophy and the philosopher are further set in opposition to the faith"|FALSE
39064|"of the heart, the intimacy and intensity of feeling, the depth of love and"|FALSE
39064|"trust, which in practice often go along with imperfect ideas. The"|FALSE
39064|"philosopher is made one who has emancipated himself from the heart and"|FALSE
39064|"feelings,—a pure intelligence, who is set above all creeds, contemplating"|FALSE
39064|"all, and holding none. Consistency and clearness become his idol, to be"|FALSE
39064|"worshipped at any cost, save one sacrifice: and that one sacrifice is the"|FALSE
39064|"sacrifice of his own self-conceit. For consistency generally means that"|FALSE
39064|"all is made to harmonise with one assumed standpoint, and that whatever"|FALSE
39064|"presents discrepancies with this alleged standard is ruthlessly thrown"|FALSE
39064|"away. Such a philosophy mistakes its function, which is not, as Heine"|FALSE
39064|"scoffs, to make an intelligible system by rejecting the discordant"|FALSE
39064|"fragments of life, but to follow reverently, if slowly, in the wake of"|FALSE
39064|"experience. Such a “perfect sage,” with his parade of reasonableness, may"|FALSE
39064|"often assume the post of a dictator."|FALSE
39064|"And, above all, intelligence is only half itself when it is not also will."|FALSE
39064|"And both are more than mere consciousness. Plato—whom we refer to, because"|FALSE
39064|"he is the coryphaeus of all the diverse host of Greek philosophy—seems to"|FALSE
39064|"overestimate or rather to misconceive the place of knowledge. That it is"|FALSE
39064|"the supreme and crowning grace of the soul, he sees. But he tends to"|FALSE
39064|"identify it with the supreme or higher soul:—as Aristotle did after him,"|FALSE
39064|"to be followed by the Stoics and Neo-Platonists. For them the supreme, or"|FALSE
39064|"almost supreme reality is the intelligence or reason: the soul is only on"|FALSE
39064|"a second grade of reality, on the borders of the natural or physical"|FALSE
39064|"world. When Plato takes that line, he turns towards the path of"|FALSE
39064|"asceticism, and treats the philosophic life as a preparation for that"|FALSE
39064|"truer life when intelligence shall be all in all, for that better land"|FALSE
39064|"where “divine dialogues” shall form the staple and substance of spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"existence. Aristotle,—who less often treads these solitudes,—still extols"|FALSE
39064|"the theoretic life, when the body and its needs trouble no more, when the"|FALSE
39064|"activity of reason—the theory of theory—is attained at least as entirely"|FALSE
39064|"as mortal conditions allow man to be deified. Of the “apathy” and the"|FALSE
39064|"reasonable conformity of the Stoics, or of the purely negative character"|FALSE
39064|"of Epicurean happiness (the excision of all that pained) we need not here"|FALSE
39064|"speak. And in Plotinus and Proclus the deification of mere reason is at"|FALSE
39064|"any rate the dominant note; whatever protests the larger Greek nature in"|FALSE
39064|"the former may from time to time offer. The truth which philosophy should"|FALSE
39064|"have taught was that Mind or intelligence was the element where the inner"|FALSE
39064|"life culminated and expanded and flourished: the error which it often"|FALSE
39064|"tended to spread was that intelligence was the higher life of which all"|FALSE
39064|"other was a degenerate shortcoming, and something valuable on its own"|FALSE
39064|"account."|FALSE
39064|"It may be that thus to interpret Plato is to do him an injustice. It has"|FALSE
39064|"been sometimes said that his division of parts or kinds of soul—or his"|FALSE
39064|"distinction between its fighting horses—tends to destroy the unity of"|FALSE
39064|"mental life. But perhaps this was exactly what he wanted to convey. There"|FALSE
39064|"are—we may paraphrase his meaning—three kinds of human being, three types"|FALSE
39064|"of human life. There is the man or the life of appetite and the flesh:"|FALSE
39064|"there is the man of noble emotion and energetic depth of soul: there is"|FALSE
39064|"the life of reasonable pursuits and organised principle. Or, we may take"|FALSE
39064|"his meaning to be that there are three elements or provinces of mental"|FALSE
39064|"life, which in all except a few are but imperfectly coherent and do not"|FALSE
39064|"reach a true or complete unity. Some unity there always is: but in the"|FALSE
39064|"life of mere appetite and impulse, even when these impulses are our nobler"|FALSE
39064|"sentiments of love and hatred, the unity falls very far short. Or, as he"|FALSE
39064|"puts the theme elsewhere, the soul has a passion for self-completion, a"|FALSE
39064|"love of beauty, which in most is but a misleading lust. It is the business"|FALSE
39064|"of the philosophic life to re-create or to foster this unity: or"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy is the persistent search of the soul for its lost unity, the"|FALSE
39064|"search to see that unity which is always its animating principle, its"|FALSE
39064|"inner faith. When the soul has reached this ideal—if it can be supposed to"|FALSE
39064|"attain it (and of this the strong-souled ancient philosophers feel no"|FALSE
39064|"doubt),—then a change must take place. The love of beauty is not"|FALSE
39064|"suppressed; it is only made self-assured and its object freed from all"|FALSE
39064|"imperfection. It is not that passion has ceased; but its nature is so"|FALSE
39064|"transfigured, that it seems worthy of a nobler name, which yet we cannot"|FALSE
39064|"give. To such a life, where battle and conflict are as such unknown, we"|FALSE
39064|"cannot longer give the title of life: and we say that philosophy is in"|FALSE
39064|"life a rehearsal of death(70). And yet if there be no battle, there is not"|FALSE
39064|"for that reason mere inaction. Hence, as the Republic concludes, the true"|FALSE
39064|"philosopher is the complete man. He is the truth and reality which the"|FALSE
39064|"appetitive and emotional man were seeking after and failed to realise. It"|FALSE
39064|"is true they at first will not see this. But the whole long process of"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy is the means to induce this conviction. And for Plato it"|FALSE
39064|"remains clear that through experience, through wisdom, and through"|FALSE
39064|"abstract deduction, the philosopher will justify his claim to him who hath"|FALSE
39064|"ears to hear and heart to understand. If that be so, the asceticism of"|FALSE
39064|"Plato is not a mere war upon flesh and sense as such, but upon flesh and"|FALSE
39064|"sense as imperfect truth, fragmentary reality, which suppose themselves"|FALSE
39064|"complete, though they are again and again confuted by experience, by"|FALSE
39064|"wisdom, and by mere calculation,—a war against their blindness and"|FALSE
39064|"shortsightedness."|FALSE
39064|"Essay IV. Psycho-Genesis."|FALSE
39064|"“The key,” says Carus, “for the ascertainment of the nature of the"|FALSE
39064|"conscious psychical life lies in the region of the unconscious(71).” The"|FALSE
39064|"view which these words take is at least as old as the days of Leibniz. It"|FALSE
39064|"means that the mental world does not abruptly emerge a full-grown"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence, but has a genesis, and follows a law of development: that"|FALSE
39064|"its life may be described as the differentiation (with integration) of a"|FALSE
39064|"simple or indifferentiated mass. The terms conscious and unconscious,"|FALSE
39064|"indeed, with their lax popular uses, leave the door wide open for"|FALSE
39064|"misconception. But they may serve to mark that the mind is to be"|FALSE
39064|"understood only in a certain relation (partly of antithesis) to nature,"|FALSE
39064|"and the soul only in reference to the body. The so-called “superior"|FALSE
39064|"faculties”—specially characteristic of humanity—are founded upon, and do"|FALSE
39064|"not abruptly supersede, the lower powers which are supposed to be"|FALSE
39064|"specially obvious in the animals(72). The individual and specific"|FALSE
39064|"phenomena of consciousness, which the psychologist is generally supposed"|FALSE
39064|"to study, rest upon a deeper, less explicated, more indefinite, life of"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility, which in its turn fades away by immeasurable gradations into"|FALSE
39064|"something irresponsive to the ordinary tests for sensation and life."|FALSE
39064|"And yet the moment we attempt to leave the daylight of consciousness for"|FALSE
39064|"the darker sides of sub-conscious life, the risks of misinterpretation"|FALSE
39064|"multiply. The problem is to some extent the same as confronts the student"|FALSE
39064|"of the ideas and principles of primitive races. There, the temptation of"|FALSE
39064|"seeing things through the “spectacles of civilisation” is almost"|FALSE
39064|"irresistible. So in psychology we are apt to import into the life of"|FALSE
39064|"sensation and feeling the distinctions and relations of subsequent"|FALSE
39064|"intellection. Nor is the difficulty lessened by Hegel’s method which deals"|FALSE
39064|"with soul, sentiency, and consciousness as grades or general"|FALSE
39064|"characteristics in a developmental advance. He borrows his illustrations"|FALSE
39064|"from many quarters, from morbid and anomalous states of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness,—less from the cases of savages, children and animals. These"|FALSE
39064|"illustrations may be called a loose induction. But it requires a much more"|FALSE
39064|"powerful instrument than mere induction to build up a scientific system; a"|FALSE
39064|"framework of general principle or theory is the only basis on which to"|FALSE
39064|"build theory by the allegation of facts, however numerous. Yet in"|FALSE
39064|"philosophic science, which is systematised knowledge, all facts strictly"|FALSE
39064|"so described will find their place and be estimated at their proper value."|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Primitive Sensibility."|FALSE
39064|"Psychology (with Hegel) takes up the work of science from biology. The"|FALSE
39064|"mind comes before it as the supreme product of the natural world, the"|FALSE
39064|"finest flower of organic life, the “truth” of the physical process. As"|FALSE
39064|"such it is called by the time-honoured name of Soul. If we further go on"|FALSE
39064|"to say that the soul is the principle of life, we must not understand this"|FALSE
39064|"vital principle to be something over and above the life of which it is the"|FALSE
39064|"principle. Such a locally-separable principle is an addition which is due"|FALSE
39064|"to the analogy of mechanical movement, where a detached agent sets in"|FALSE
39064|"motion and directs the machinery. But in the organism the principle is not"|FALSE
39064|"thus detachable as a thing or agent. By calling Soul the principle of life"|FALSE
39064|"we rather mean that in the vital organism, so far as it _lives_, all the"|FALSE
39064|"real variety, separation, and discontinuity of parts must be reduced to"|FALSE
39064|"unity and identity, or as Hegel would say, to _ideality_. To live is thus"|FALSE
39064|"to keep all differences fluid and permeable in the fire of the"|FALSE
39064|"life-process. Or to use a familiar term of logic, the Soul is the concept"|FALSE
39064|"or intelligible unity of the organic body. But to call it a concept might"|FALSE
39064|"suggest that it is only the conception through which _we_ represent to"|FALSE
39064|"ourselves the variety in unity of the organism. The soul, however, is more"|FALSE
39064|"than a mere concept: and life is more than a mere mode of description for"|FALSE
39064|"a group of movements forming an objective unity. It is a unity, subjective"|FALSE
39064|"and objective. The organism is one life, controlling difference: and it is"|FALSE
39064|"also one by our effort to comprehend it. The Soul therefore is in Hegelian"|FALSE
39064|"language described as the Idea rather than the concept of the organic"|FALSE
39064|"body. Life is the generic title for this subject-object: but the life may"|FALSE
39064|"be merely physical, or it may be intellectual and practical, or it may be"|FALSE
39064|"absolute, i.e. will and know all that it is, and be all that it knows and"|FALSE
39064|"wills."|FALSE
39064|"Up to this point the world is what is called an external, which is here"|FALSE
39064|"taken to mean (not a world external to the individual, but) a"|FALSE
39064|"self-externalised world. That is to say, it is the observer who has"|FALSE
39064|"hitherto by his interpretation of his perceptions supplied the “Spirit in"|FALSE
39064|"Nature.” In itself the external world has no inside, no centre: it is we"|FALSE
39064|"who read into it the conception of a life-history. We are led to believe"|FALSE
39064|"that a principle of unity is always at work throughout the physical"|FALSE
39064|"world—even in the mathematical laws of natural operation. It is only"|FALSE
39064|"intelligible and credible to us as a system, a continuous and regular"|FALSE
39064|"development. But that system is only a hypothetical idea, though it is"|FALSE
39064|"held to be a conclusion to which all the evidence seems unequivocally to"|FALSE
39064|"point. And, even in organic life, the unity, though more perfect and"|FALSE
39064|"palpable than in the mechanical and inorganic world, is only a perception,"|FALSE
39064|"a vision,—a necessary mode of realising the unity of the facts. The"|FALSE
39064|"phenomenon of life reveals as in a picture and an ocular demonstration the"|FALSE
39064|"conformity of inward and outward, the identity of whole and parts, of"|FALSE
39064|"power and utterance. But it is still outside the observer. In the function"|FALSE
39064|"of sensibility and sentiency, however, we stand as it were on the"|FALSE
39064|"border-line between biology and psychology. At one step we have been"|FALSE
39064|"brought within the harmony, and are no longer mere observers and"|FALSE
39064|"reflecters. The sentient not merely is, but is aware that it is. Hitherto"|FALSE
39064|"as life, it only is the unity in diversity, and diversity in unity, for"|FALSE
39064|"the outsider, i.e. only implicitly: now it is so for itself, or"|FALSE
39064|"consciously. And in the first stage it does not know, but feels or is"|FALSE
39064|"sentient. Here, for the first time, is created the distinction of inward"|FALSE
39064|"and outward. Loosely indeed we may, like Mr. Spencer, speak of outward and"|FALSE
39064|"inward in physiology: but strictly speaking, what Goethe says is true,"|FALSE
39064|"_Natur hat weder Kern noch Schaale_(73). Nature in the narrower sense"|FALSE
39064|"knows no distinction of the inward and outward in its phenomena: it is a"|FALSE
39064|"purely superficial order and succession of appearance and event. The Idea"|FALSE
39064|"which has been visible to an intelligent percipient in the types and laws"|FALSE
39064|"of the natural world, now _is_, actually is—is in and for itself—but at"|FALSE
39064|"first in a minimum of content, a mere point of light, or rather the dawn"|FALSE
39064|"which has yet to expand into the full day."|FALSE
39064|"Spinoza has asserted that “all individual bodies are animate, though in"|FALSE
39064|"different degrees(74).” Now it is to a great extent this diversity of"|FALSE
39064|"degree on which the main interest turns. Yet it is well to remember that"|FALSE
39064|"the abrupt and trenchant separations which popular practice loves are"|FALSE
39064|"overridden to a deeper view by an essential unity of idea, reducing them"|FALSE
39064|"to indifference. If, that is, we take seriously the Spinozist unity of"|FALSE
39064|"Substance, and the continual correlation (to call it no more) of extension"|FALSE
39064|"and consciousness therein, we cannot avoid the conclusion which even Bacon"|FALSE
39064|"would admit of something describable as attraction and perception,"|FALSE
39064|"something subduing diversity to unity. But whether it be well to name this"|FALSE
39064|"soul or life is a different matter. It may indeed only be taken to mean"|FALSE
39064|"that all true being must be looked on as a real unity and individuality,"|FALSE
39064|"must, that is, be conceived as manifesting itself in organisation, must be"|FALSE
39064|"referred to a self-centred and self-developing activity. But this—which is"|FALSE
39064|"the fundamental thesis of idealism—is hardly all that is meant. Rather"|FALSE
39064|"Spinoza would imply that all things which form a real unity must have"|FALSE
39064|"life—must have inner principle and unifying reality: and what he teaches"|FALSE
39064|"is closely akin to the Leibnitian doctrine that every substantial"|FALSE
39064|"existence reposes upon a monad, a unity which is at once both a force and"|FALSE
39064|"a cognition, a “representation” and an appetite or _nisus_ to act. When"|FALSE
39064|"Fechner in a series of works(75) expounds and defends the hypothesis that"|FALSE
39064|"plants and planets are not destitute of soul, any more than man and"|FALSE
39064|"animals, he only gives a more pronounced expression to this idealisation"|FALSE
39064|"or spiritualisation of the natural world. But for the moment the point to"|FALSE
39064|"be noted is that all of this idealistic doctrine is an inference, or a"|FALSE
39064|"development which finds its _point d’appui_ in the fact of sensation. And"|FALSE
39064|"the problem of the Philosophy of Mind is just to trace the process whereby"|FALSE
39064|"a mere shock of sensation has grown into a conception and a faith in the"|FALSE
39064|"goodness, beauty and intelligence of the world."|FALSE
39064|"Schopenhauer has put the point with his usual picturesqueness. Outward"|FALSE
39064|"nature presents nothing but a play of forces. At first, however, this"|FALSE
39064|"force shows merely the mechanical phenomena of pressure and impact, and"|FALSE
39064|"its theory is sufficiently described by mathematical physics. But in the"|FALSE
39064|"process of nature force assumes higher types, types where it loses a"|FALSE
39064|"certain amount of its externality(76), till in the organic world it"|FALSE
39064|"acquires a peculiar phase which Schopenhauer calls _Will_, meaning by"|FALSE
39064|"that, however, an organising and controlling power, a tendency or _nisus_"|FALSE
39064|"to be and live, which is persistent and potent, but without consciousness."|FALSE
39064|"This blind force, which however has a certain coherence and purposiveness,"|FALSE
39064|"is in the animal organism endowed with a new character, in consequence of"|FALSE
39064|"the emergence of a new organ. This organ, the brain and nervous system,"|FALSE
39064|"causes the evolution into clear day of an element which has been growing"|FALSE
39064|"more and more urgent. The gathering tendency of force to return into"|FALSE
39064|"itself is now complete: the cycle of operation is formed: and the junction"|FALSE
39064|"of the two currents issues in the spark of sensation. The blind force now"|FALSE
39064|"becomes seeing."|FALSE
39064|"But at first—and this is the point we have to emphasise—its powers of"|FALSE
39064|"vision are limited. Sensibility is either a local and restricted"|FALSE
39064|"phenomenon: or, in so far as it is not local, it is vague and indefinite,"|FALSE
39064|"and hardly entitled to the name of sensibility. Either it is a dim, but"|FALSE
39064|"far-reaching, sympathy with environing existence, and in that case only"|FALSE
39064|"so-called blind will or feeling: or if it is clear, is locally confined,"|FALSE
39064|"and at first within very narrow limits. Neither of these points must be"|FALSE
39064|"lost sight of. On the one hand feeling has to be regarded as the dull and"|FALSE
39064|"confused stirring of an almost infinite sympathy with the world—a pulse"|FALSE
39064|"which has come from the far-distant movements of the universe, and bears"|FALSE
39064|"with it, if but as a possibility, the wealth of an infinite message. On"|FALSE
39064|"the other hand, feeling at first only becomes real, in this boundless"|FALSE
39064|"ideality to which its possibilities extend, by restricting itself to one"|FALSE
39064|"little point and from several points organising itself to a unity of"|FALSE
39064|"bodily feeling, till it can go on from thence to embrace the universe in"|FALSE
39064|"distinct and articulate comprehension."|FALSE
39064|"Soul, says Hegel, is not a separate and additional something over and"|FALSE
39064|"above the rest of nature: it is rather nature’s “’universal immaterialism,"|FALSE
39064|"and simple ideal life(77).” There were ancient philosophers who spoke of"|FALSE
39064|"the soul as a self-adjusting number,—as a harmony, or equilibrium(78)—and"|FALSE
39064|"the moderns have added considerably to the list of these analogical"|FALSE
39064|"definitions. As definitions they obviously fall short. Yet these things"|FALSE
39064|"give, as it were, by anticipation, an image of soul, as the “ideality,”"|FALSE
39064|"which reduces the manifold to unity. The adhesions and cohesions of"|FALSE
39064|"matter, its gravitating attractions, its chemical affinities and"|FALSE
39064|"electrical polarities, the intricate out-and-in of organic structure, are"|FALSE
39064|"all preludes to the true incorporating unity which is the ever-immanent"|FALSE
39064|"supersession of the endless self-externalism and successionalism of"|FALSE
39064|"physical reality. But in sentiency, feeling, or sensibility, the unity"|FALSE
39064|"which all of these imply without reaching, is explicitly present. It is"|FALSE
39064|"implicitly an all-embracing unity: an infinite,—which has no doors and no"|FALSE
39064|"windows, for the good reason that it needs none, because it has nothing"|FALSE
39064|"outside it, because it “expresses” and “envelopes” (however confusedly at"|FALSE
39064|"first) the whole universe. Thus, even if, with localising phraseology, we"|FALSE
39064|"may describe mind, where it _appears_ emerging in the natural world, as a"|FALSE
39064|"mere feeble and incidental outburst,—a rebellion breaking out as in some"|FALSE
39064|"petty province or isolated region against the great law of the physical"|FALSE
39064|"realm—we are in so speaking taking only an external standpoint. But with"|FALSE
39064|"the rise of mind in nature the bond of externalism is implicitly overcome."|FALSE
39064|"To it, and where it really is, there is nothing outside, nothing"|FALSE
39064|"transcendent. Everything which is said to be outside mind is only outside"|FALSE
39064|"a localised and limited mind—outside a mind which is imperfectly and"|FALSE
39064|"abstractly realised—not outside mind absolutely. Mind is the absolute"|FALSE
39064|"negation of externality: not a mere relative negative, as the organism may"|FALSE
39064|"be biologically described as inner in respect of the environment. To"|FALSE
39064|"accomplish this negation in actuality, to bring the multiplicity and"|FALSE
39064|"externality of things into the unity and identity of one Idea, is the"|FALSE
39064|"process of development of mind from animal sensibility to philosophic"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge, from appetite to art,—the process of culture through the social"|FALSE
39064|"state under the influence of religion."|FALSE
39064|"Sentiency or psychic matter (mind-stuff), to begin with, is in some"|FALSE
39064|"respects like the _tabula rasa_ of the empiricists. It is the"|FALSE
39064|"possibility—but the real possibility—of intelligence rather than"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence itself. It is the monotonous undifferentiated inwardness—a"|FALSE
39064|"faint self-awareness and self-realisation of the material world, but at"|FALSE
39064|"first a mere vague _psychical protoplasm_ and without defined nucleus,"|FALSE
39064|"without perceptible organisation or separation of structures. If there is"|FALSE
39064|"self-awareness, it is not yet discriminated into a distinct and unified"|FALSE
39064|"self, not yet differentiated and integrated,—soul in the condition of a"|FALSE
39064|"mere “Is,” which, however, is nothing determinate. It is very much in the"|FALSE
39064|"situation of Condillac’s statue-man—_une statue organisée intérieurement"|FALSE
39064|"comme nous, et animée d’un esprit privé de toute espèce d’idées_: alike at"|FALSE
39064|"least so far that the rigid uniformity of the latter’s envelope prevents"|FALSE
39064|"all articulated organisation of its faculties. The foundation under all"|FALSE
39064|"the diversity and individuality in the concrete intelligent and volitional"|FALSE
39064|"life is a common feeling,—a _sensus communis_—a general and indeterminate"|FALSE
39064|"susceptibility to influence, a sympathy responsive, but responsive vaguely"|FALSE
39064|"and equivocally, to all the stimuli of the physical environment. There was"|FALSE
39064|"once a time, according to primitive legend, when man understood the"|FALSE
39064|"language of beast and bird, and even surprised the secret converse of"|FALSE
39064|"trees and flowers. Such fancies are but the exaggeration of a solidarity"|FALSE
39064|"of conscious life which seems to spread far in the sub-conscious realm,"|FALSE
39064|"and to narrow the individual’s soul into limited channels as it rises into"|FALSE
39064|"clear self-perception,"|FALSE
39064|"    “As thro’ the frame that binds him in"|FALSE
39064|"    His isolation grows defined.”"|FALSE
39064|"It may be a mere dream that, as Goethe feigns of Makaria in his"|FALSE
39064|"romance(79), there are men and women in sympathy with the vicissitudes of"|FALSE
39064|"the starry regions: and hypotheses of lunar influence, or dogmas of"|FALSE
39064|"astrological destiny, may count to the present guardians of the sciences"|FALSE
39064|"as visionary superstitions. Yet science in these regions has no reason to"|FALSE
39064|"be dogmatic; her function hitherto can only be critical; and even for"|FALSE
39064|"that, her data are scanty and her principles extremely general. The"|FALSE
39064|"influences on the mental mood and faculty, produced by climate and"|FALSE
39064|"seasons, by local environment and national type, by individual"|FALSE
39064|"peculiarities, by the differences of age and sex, and by the alternation"|FALSE
39064|"of night and day, of sleep and waking, are less questionable. It is easy"|FALSE
39064|"no doubt to ignore or forget them: easy to remark how indefinable and"|FALSE
39064|"incalculable they are. But that does not lessen their radical and"|FALSE
39064|"inevitable impress in the determination of the whole character. “The sum"|FALSE
39064|"of our existence, divided by reason, never comes out exact, but always"|FALSE
39064|"leaves a marvellous remainder(80).” Irrational this residue is, in the"|FALSE
39064|"sense that it is inexplicable, and incommensurable with the well-known"|FALSE
39064|"quantities of conscious and voluntarily organised life. But a scientific"|FALSE
39064|"psychology, which is adequate to the real and concrete mind, should never"|FALSE
39064|"lose sight of the fact that every one of its propositions in regard to the"|FALSE
39064|"more advanced phases of intellectual development is thoroughly and in"|FALSE
39064|"indefinable ways modified by these preconditions. When that is remembered,"|FALSE
39064|"it will be obvious how complicated is the problem of adapting psychology"|FALSE
39064|"for the application to education, and how dependent the solution of that"|FALSE
39064|"problem is upon an experiential familiarity with the data of individual"|FALSE
39064|"and national temperament and character."|FALSE
39064|"The first stage in mental development is the establishment of regular and"|FALSE
39064|"uniform relations between soul and body: it is the differentiation of"|FALSE
39064|"organs and the integration of function: the balance between sensation and"|FALSE
39064|"movement, between the afferent and efferent processes of sensitivity."|FALSE
39064|"Given a potential soul, the problem is to make it actual in an individual"|FALSE
39064|"body. It is the business of a physical psychology to describe in detail"|FALSE
39064|"the steps by which the body we are attached to is made inward as our idea"|FALSE
39064|"through the several organs and their nervous appurtenances: whereas a"|FALSE
39064|"psychical physiology would conversely explain the corresponding processes"|FALSE
39064|"for the expression of the emotions and for the objectification of the"|FALSE
39064|"volitions. Thus soul inwardises (_erinnert_) or envelops body: which body"|FALSE
39064|"“expresses” or develops soul. The actual soul is the unity of both, is the"|FALSE
39064|"percipient individual. The solidarity or “communion” of body and soul is"|FALSE
39064|"here the dominant fact: the soul sentient of changes in its peripheral"|FALSE
39064|"organs, and transmitting emotion and volition into physical effect. It is"|FALSE
39064|"on this psychical unity,—the unity which is the soul of the diversity of"|FALSE
39064|"body—that all the subsequent developments of mind rest. Sensation is thus"|FALSE
39064|"the _prius_—or basis—of all mental life: the organisation of soul in body"|FALSE
39064|"and of body in soul. It is the process which historically has been"|FALSE
39064|"prepared in the evolution of animal life from those undifferentiated forms"|FALSE
39064|"where specialised organs are yet unknown, and which each individual has"|FALSE
39064|"further to realise and complete for himself, by learning to see and hear,"|FALSE
39064|"and use his limbs. At first, moreover, it begins from many separate"|FALSE
39064|"centres and only through much collision and mutual compliance arrives at"|FALSE
39064|"comparative uniformity and centralisation. The common basis of united"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility supplied by the one organism has to be made real and"|FALSE
39064|"effective, and it is so at first by sporadic and comparatively independent"|FALSE
39064|"developments. If self-hood means reference to self of what is prima facie"|FALSE
39064|"not self, and projection of self therein, there is in primitive"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility only the germ or possibility of self-hood. In the early phases"|FALSE
39064|"of psychic development the centre is fluctuating and ill-defined, and it"|FALSE
39064|"takes time and trouble to co-ordinate or unify the various starting-points"|FALSE
39064|"of sensibility(81)."|FALSE
39064|"This consolidation of inward life may be looked at either formally or"|FALSE
39064|"concretely. Under the first head, it means the growth of a central unity"|FALSE
39064|"of apperception. In the second case, it means a peculiar aggregate of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas and sentiments. There is growing up within him what we may call the"|FALSE
39064|"individuality of the individual,—an irrational, i.e. not consciously"|FALSE
39064|"intelligent, nether-self or inner soul, a firm aggregation of hopes and"|FALSE
39064|"wishes, of views and feelings, or rather of tendencies and temperament, of"|FALSE
39064|"character hereditary and acquired. It is the law of the natural will or"|FALSE
39064|"character which from an inaccessible background dominates our"|FALSE
39064|"action,—which, because it is not realised and formulated in consciousness,"|FALSE
39064|"behaves like a guardian spirit, or genius, or destiny within us. This"|FALSE
39064|"genius is the sub-conscious unity of the sensitive life—the manner of man"|FALSE
39064|"which unknown to ourselves we are,—and which influences us against our"|FALSE
39064|"nominal or formal purposes. So far as this predominates, our ends, rough"|FALSE
39064|"hew them how we will, are given by a force which is not really, i.e. with"|FALSE
39064|"full consciousness, ours: by a mass of ingrained prejudice and unreasoned"|FALSE
39064|"sympathies, of instincts and passions, of fancies and feelings, which have"|FALSE
39064|"condensed and organised themselves into a natural power. As the child in"|FALSE
39064|"the mother’s womb is responsive to her psychic influences, so the"|FALSE
39064|"development of a man’s psychic life is guided by feelings centred in"|FALSE
39064|"objects and agents external to him, who form the genius presiding over his"|FALSE
39064|"development. His soul, to that extent, is really in another: he himself is"|FALSE
39064|"selfless, and when his stay is removed the principle of his life is"|FALSE
39064|"gone(82). He is but a bundle of impressions, held together by influences"|FALSE
39064|"and ties which in years before consciousness proper began made him what he"|FALSE
39064|"is. Such is the involuntary adaptation to example and environment, which"|FALSE
39064|"establishes in the depths below personality a self which becomes hereafter"|FALSE
39064|"the determinant of action. Early years, in which the human being is"|FALSE
39064|"naturally susceptible, build up by imitation, by pliant obedience, an"|FALSE
39064|"image, a system, reproducing the immediate surroundings. The soul, as yet"|FALSE
39064|"selfless, and ready to accept any imprint, readily moulds itself into the"|FALSE
39064|"likeness of an authoritative influence."|FALSE
39064|"The step by which the universality or unity of the self is realised in the"|FALSE
39064|"variety of its sensation is Habit. Habit gives us a definite"|FALSE
39064|"standing-ground in the flux of single impressions: it is the"|FALSE
39064|"identification of ourselves with what is most customary and familiar: an"|FALSE
39064|"identification which takes place by practice and repetition. If it"|FALSE
39064|"circumscribes us to one little province of being, it on the other frees us"|FALSE
39064|"from the vague indeterminateness where we are at the mercy of every"|FALSE
39064|"passing mood. It makes thus much of our potential selves our very own, our"|FALSE
39064|"acquisition and permanent possession. It, above all, makes us free and at"|FALSE
39064|"one with our bodily part, so that henceforth we start as a subjective unit"|FALSE
39064|"of body and soul. We have now as the result of the anthropological process"|FALSE
39064|"a self or ego, an individual consciousness able to reflect and compare,"|FALSE
39064|"setting itself on one side (a soul in bodily organisation), and on the"|FALSE
39064|"other setting an object of consciousness, or external world, a world of"|FALSE
39064|"other things. All this presupposes that the soul has actualised itself by"|FALSE
39064|"appropriating and acquiring as its expression and organ the physical"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility which is its body. By restricting and establishing itself, it"|FALSE
39064|"has gained a fixed standpoint. No doubt it has localised and confined"|FALSE
39064|"itself, but it is no longer at the disposal of externals and accident: it"|FALSE
39064|"has laid the foundation for higher developments."|FALSE
39064|"(ii.) Anomalies of Psychical Life."|FALSE
39064|"Psychology, as we have seen, goes for information regarding the earlier"|FALSE
39064|"stages of mental growth to the child and the animal,—perhaps also to the"|FALSE
39064|"savage. So too sociology founds certain conclusions upon the observations"|FALSE
39064|"of savage customs and institutions, or on the earlier records of the race."|FALSE
39064|"In both cases with a limitation caused by the externality and"|FALSE
39064|"fragmentariness of the facts and the need of interpreting them through our"|FALSE

39064|"corresponding inquiries may be pursued; and where the danger of the"|FALSE
39064|"conclusions arrived at, though not perhaps less real, is certainly of a"|FALSE
39064|"different kind. In sociology we can observe—and almost experiment upon—the"|FALSE
39064|"phenomena of the lapsed, degenerate and criminal classes. The advantage of"|FALSE

39064|"more on a level with the intelligent observer. Similar pathological"|FALSE
39064|"regions are open to us in the case of psychology. There the anomalous and"|FALSE
39064|"morbid conditions of mind co-exist with a certain amount of mature"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness. So presented, they are thrown out into relief. They form"|FALSE
39064|"the negative instances which serve to corroborate our positive inductions."|FALSE
39064|"The regularly concatenated and solid structure of normal mind is under"|FALSE
39064|"abnormal and deranged conditions thrown into disorder, and its"|FALSE
39064|"constituents are presented in their several isolation. Such phenomena are"|FALSE

39064|"Even amongst candid and honest-minded students of psychology there is a"|FALSE
39064|"certain reluctance to dabble in researches into the night-side of the"|FALSE

39064|"Unconscious seemed—and to many still seems—a region in which the charlatan"|FALSE
39064|"and the dupe can and must play into each other’s hands. Once in the whirl"|FALSE
39064|"of spiritualist and crypto-psychical inquiry you could not tell how far"|FALSE
39064|"you might be carried. The facts moreover were of a peculiar type."|FALSE
39064|"Dependent as they seemed to be on the frame of mind of observers and"|FALSE
39064|"observed, they defied the ordinary criteria of detached and abstract"|FALSE
39064|"observation. You can only observe them, it is urged, when you believe;"|FALSE
39064|"scepticism destroys them. Now there is a widespread natural impatience"|FALSE
39064|"against what Bacon has called “monodical” phenomena, phenomena i.e. which"|FALSE
39064|"claim to come under a special law of their own, or to have a private and"|FALSE
39064|"privileged sphere. And this impatience cuts the Gordian knot by a"|FALSE
39064|"determination to treat all instances which oppose its hitherto ascertained"|FALSE
39064|"laws as due to deception and fraud, or, at the best, to incompetent"|FALSE
39064|"observation, confusions of memory, and superstitions of ignorance. Above"|FALSE
39064|"all, great interests of religion and personality seemed to connect"|FALSE
39064|"themselves with these revelations—interests, at any rate, to which our"|FALSE
39064|"common humanity thrills; it seemed as if, in this region beyond the"|FALSE
39064|"customary range of the conscious and the seen, one might learn something"|FALSE
39064|"of the deeper realities which lie in the unseen. But to feel that so much"|FALSE
39064|"was at stake was naturally unfavourable to purely dispassionate"|FALSE
39064|"observation."|FALSE
39064|"The philosophers were found—as might have been expected—amongst those most"|FALSE

39064|"practitioner. This new force—mainly because of the recent interest in the"|FALSE
39064|"remarkable advances of magnetic and electrical research—was conceived as a"|FALSE
39064|"fluid, and called Animal Magnetism. At one time indeed Mesmer actually"|FALSE
39064|"employed a magnet in the manipulation by which he induced the peculiar"|FALSE
39064|"condition in his patients. The accompaniments of his procedure were in"|FALSE
39064|"many respects those of the quack-doctor; and with the quack indeed he was"|FALSE
39064|"often classed. A French commission of inquiry appointed to examine into"|FALSE
39064|"his performances reported in 1784 that, while there was no doubt as to the"|FALSE
39064|"reality of many of the phenomena, and even of the cures, there was no"|FALSE
39064|"evidence for the alleged new physical force, and declared the effects to"|FALSE
39064|"be mainly attributable to the influence of imagination. And with the"|FALSE
39064|"mention of this familiar phrase, further explanation was supposed to be"|FALSE
39064|"rendered superfluous."|FALSE
39064|"In France political excitement allowed the mesmeric theory and practice to"|FALSE
39064|"drop out of notice till the fall of the first Empire. But in Germany there"|FALSE
39064|"was a considerable amount of investigations and hypotheses into these"|FALSE
39064|"mystical phenomena, though rarely by the ordinary routine workers in the"|FALSE
39064|"scientific field. The phenomena where they were discussed were studied and"|FALSE
39064|"interpreted in two directions. Some theorists, like Jung-Stilling,"|FALSE
39064|"Eschenmayer, Schubert, and Kerner, took the more metaphysicist and"|FALSE
39064|"spiritualistic view: they saw in them the witness to a higher truth, to"|FALSE
39064|"the presence and operation in this lower world of a higher and spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"matter, a so-called ether. Thus Animal Magnetism supplied a sort of"|FALSE
39064|"physical theory of the other world and the other life. Jung-Stilling, e.g."|FALSE
39064|"in his “Theory of Spirit-lore.” (1808), regarded the spiritualistic"|FALSE
39064|"phenomena as a justification of—what he believed to be—the Kantian"|FALSE
39064|"doctrine that in the truly real and persistent world space and time are no"|FALSE
39064|"more. The other direction of inquiry kept more to the physical field."|FALSE
39064|"Ritter (whose researches interested both Schelling and Hegel) supposed he"|FALSE
39064|"had detected the new force underlying mesmerism and the like, and gave to"|FALSE
39064|"it the name of Siderism (1808); while Amoretti of Milan named the object"|FALSE
39064|"of his experiments Animal Electrometry (1816). Kieser(85), again (1826)"|FALSE
39064|"spoke of Tellurism, and connected animal magnetism with the play of"|FALSE
39064|"general terrestrial forces in the human being."|FALSE
39064|"At a later date (1857) Schindler, in his “Magical Spirit-life,” expounded"|FALSE
39064|"a theory of mental polarity. The psychical life has two poles or"|FALSE
39064|"centres,—its day-pole, around which revolves our ordinary and superficial"|FALSE
39064|"current of ideas, and its night-pole, round which gathers the"|FALSE
39064|"sub-conscious and deeper group of beliefs and sentiments. Either life has"|FALSE
39064|"a memory, a consciousness, a world of its own: and they flourish to a"|FALSE
39064|"large extent inversely to each other. The day-world has for its organs of"|FALSE
39064|"receiving information the ordinary senses. But the magical or night-world"|FALSE
39064|"of the soul has its feelers also, which set men directly in telepathic"|FALSE
39064|"rapport with influences, however distant, exerted by the whole world: and"|FALSE
39064|"through this “inner sense” which serves to concentrate in itself all the"|FALSE
39064|"telluric forces (—a sense which in its various aspects we name instinct,"|FALSE
39064|"presentiment, conscience) is constructed the fabric of our sub-conscious"|FALSE
39064|"system. Through it man is a sort of résumé of all the cosmic life, in"|FALSE
39064|"secret affinity and sympathy with all natural processes; and by the will"|FALSE
39064|"which stands in response therewith he can exercise a directly creative"|FALSE
39064|"action on external nature. In normal and healthy conditions the two"|FALSE
39064|"currents of psychic life run on harmonious but independent. But in the"|FALSE
39064|"phenomena of somnambulism, clairvoyance, and delirium, the magic region"|FALSE
39064|"becomes preponderant, and comes into collision with the other. The"|FALSE
39064|"dark-world emerges into the realm of day as a portentous power: and there"|FALSE
39064|"is the feeling of a double personality, or of an indwelling genius,"|FALSE
39064|"familiar spirit, or demon."|FALSE
39064|"To the ordinary physicist the so-called _Actio in distans_ was a hopeless"|FALSE
39064|"stumbling-block. If he did not comprehend the transmission (as it is"|FALSE
39064|"called) of force where there was immediate contact, he was at least"|FALSE
39064|"perfectly familiar with the outer aspect of it as a condition of his"|FALSE
39064|"limited experience. It needed one beyond the mere hodman of science to say"|FALSE
39064|"with Laplace: “We are so far from knowing all the agents of nature, that"|FALSE
39064|"it would be very unphilosophical to deny the existence of phenomena solely"|FALSE
39064|"because they are inexplicable in the present state of our knowledge.”"|FALSE
39064|"Accordingly mesmerism and its allied manifestations were generally"|FALSE
39064|"abandoned to the bohemians of science, and to investigators with dogmatic"|FALSE
39064|"bias. It was still employed as a treatment for certain ailments: and"|FALSE
39064|"philosophers, as different as Fichte and Schopenhauer(86), watched its"|FALSE
39064|"fate with attention. But the herd of professional scientists fought shy of"|FALSE
39064|"it. The experiments of Braid at Manchester in 1841 gradually helped to"|FALSE
39064|"give research into the subject a new character. Under the name of"|FALSE
39064|"Hypnotism (or, rather at first Neuro-hypnotism) he described the phenomena"|FALSE
39064|"of the magnetic sleep (induced through prolonged staring at a bright"|FALSE
39064|"object), such as abnormal rigidity of body, perverted sensibility, and the"|FALSE
39064|"remarkable obedience of the subject to the command or suggestions of the"|FALSE
39064|"operator. Thirty years afterwards, the matter became an object of"|FALSE
39064|"considerable experimental and theoretic work in France, at the rival"|FALSE
39064|"schools of Paris and Nancy; and the question, mainly under the title of"|FALSE
39064|"hypnotism, though the older name is still occasionally heard, has been for"|FALSE
39064|"several years brought prominently under public notice."|FALSE
39064|"It cannot be said that the net results of these observations and"|FALSE
39064|"hypotheses are of a very definitive character. While a large amount of"|FALSE
39064|"controversy has been waged on the comparative importance of the several"|FALSE
39064|"methods and instruments by which the hypnotic or mesmeric trance may be"|FALSE
39064|"induced, and a scarcely less wide range of divergence prevails with regard"|FALSE
39064|"to the physiological and pathological conditions in connexion with which"|FALSE
39064|"it has been most conspicuously manifested, there has been less anxiety"|FALSE
39064|"shown to determine its precise psychical nature, or its significance in"|FALSE
39064|"mental development. And yet the better understanding of these aspects may"|FALSE
39064|"throw light on several points connected with primitive religion and the"|FALSE
39064|"history of early civilisation, indeed over the whole range of what is"|FALSE
39064|"called _Völkerpsychologie_. Indeed this is one of the points which may be"|FALSE
39064|"said to emerge out of the confusion of dispute. Phenomena at least"|FALSE
39064|"analogous to those styled hypnotic have a wide range in the"|FALSE
39064|"anthropological sphere(87): and the proper characters which belong to them"|FALSE
39064|"will only be caught by an observer who examines them in the widest variety"|FALSE
39064|"of examples. Another feature which has been put in prominence is what has"|FALSE
39064|"been called “psychological automatism.” And in this name two points seem"|FALSE
39064|"to deserve note. The first is the spontaneous and as it were mechanical"|FALSE
39064|"consecution of mental states in the soul whence the interfering effect of"|FALSE
39064|"voluntary consciousness has been removed. And the second is the unfailing"|FALSE
39064|"or accurate regularity, so contrary to the hesitating and uncertain"|FALSE
39064|"procedure of our conscious and reasoned action, which so often is seen in"|FALSE
39064|"the unreflecting and unreasoned movements. To this invariable sequence of"|FALSE
39064|"psychical movement the superior control and direction by the intelligent"|FALSE
39064|"self has to adapt itself, just as it respects the order of physical laws."|FALSE
39064|"But, perhaps, the chief conclusion to be derived from hypnotic experience"|FALSE
39064|"is the value of suggestion or suggestibility. Even cool thinkers like Kant"|FALSE
39064|"have recognised how much mere mental control has to do with bodily"|FALSE
39064|"state,—how each of us, in this way, is often for good or for ill his own"|FALSE
39064|"physician. An idea is a force, and is only inactive in so far as it is"|FALSE
39064|"held in check by other ideas. “There is no such thing as hypnotism,” says"|FALSE
39064|"one: “there are only different degrees of suggestibility.” This may be to"|FALSE
39064|"exaggerate: yet it serves to impress the comparatively secondary character"|FALSE
39064|"of many of the circumstances on which the specially mesmeric or hypnotic"|FALSE
39064|"experimentalist is apt to lay exclusive stress. The methods may probably"|FALSE
39064|"vary according to circumstances. But the essence of them all is to get the"|FALSE
39064|"patient out of the general frame and system of ideas and perceptions in"|FALSE
39064|"which his ordinary individuality is encased. Considering how for all of us"|FALSE
39064|"the reality of concrete life is bound up with our visual perceptions, how"|FALSE
39064|"largely our sanity depends upon the spatial idea, and how that depends on"|FALSE
39064|"free ocular range, we can understand that darkness and temporary loss of"|FALSE
39064|"vision are powerful auxiliaries in the hypnotic process, as in magical and"|FALSE
39064|"superstitious rites. But a great deal short of this may serve to establish"|FALSE
39064|"influence. The mind of the majority of human beings, but especially of the"|FALSE
39064|"young, may be compared to a vacant seat waiting for some one to fill it."|FALSE
39064|"In Hegel’s view hypnotic phenomena produce a kind of temporary and"|FALSE
39064|"artificial atavism. Mechanical or chemical means, or morbid conditions of"|FALSE
39064|"body, may cause even for the intelligent adult a relapse into states of"|FALSE
39064|"mind closely resembling those exhibited by the primitive or the infantile"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility. The intelligent personality, where powers are bound up with"|FALSE
39064|"limitations and operate through a chain of means and ends, is reduced to"|FALSE
39064|"its primitively undifferentiated condition. Not that it is restored to its"|FALSE
39064|"infantile simplicity; but that all subsequent acquirements operate only as"|FALSE
39064|"a concentrated individuality, or mass of will and character, released from"|FALSE
39064|"the control of the self-possessed mind, and invested (by the latter’s"|FALSE
39064|"withdrawal) with a new quasi-personality of their own. With the loss of"|FALSE
39064|"the world of outward things, there may go, it is supposed, a clearer"|FALSE
39064|"perception of the inward and particularly of the organic life. The Soul"|FALSE
39064|"contains the form of unity which other experiences had impressed upon it:"|FALSE
39064|"but this form avails in its subterranean existence where it creates a sort"|FALSE
39064|"of inner self. And this inner self is no longer, like the embodied self of"|FALSE
39064|"ordinary consciousness, an intelligence served by organs, and proceeding"|FALSE
39064|"by induction and inference. Its knowledge is not mediated or carried along"|FALSE
39064|"specific channels: it does not build up, piecemeal, by successive steps of"|FALSE
39064|"synthesis and analysis, by gradual idealisation, the organised totality of"|FALSE
39064|"its intellectual world. The somnambulist and the clairvoyant see without"|FALSE
39064|"eyes, and carry their vision directly into regions where the waking"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness of orderly intelligence cannot enter. But that region is not"|FALSE
39064|"the world of our higher ideas,—of art, religion, and philosophy. It is"|FALSE
39064|"still the sensitivity—that realm of sensitivity which is ordinarily"|FALSE
39064|"covered by unconsciousness. Such sensitive clairvoyants may, as it were,"|FALSE
39064|"hear themselves growing; they may discern the hidden quivers and pulses of"|FALSE
39064|"blood and tissue, the seats of secret pain and all the unrevealed workings"|FALSE
39064|"in the dark chambers of the flesh. But always their vision seems confined"|FALSE
39064|"to that region, and will fall short of the world of light and ideal truth."|FALSE
39064|"It is towards the nature-bond of sensitive solidarity with earth, and"|FALSE
39064|"flowers, and trees, the life that “rolls through all things,” not towards"|FALSE
39064|"the spiritual unity which broods over the world and “impels all thinking"|FALSE
39064|"things,” that these immersions in the selfless universe lead us."|FALSE
39064|"What Hegel chiefly sees in these phenomena is their indication, even on"|FALSE
39064|"the natural side of man, of that ideality of the material, which it is the"|FALSE
39064|"work of intelligence to produce in the more spiritual life, in the"|FALSE
39064|"fully-developed mind. The latter is the supreme over-soul, that Absolute"|FALSE
39064|"Mind which in our highest moods, aesthetic and religious, we approximate"|FALSE
39064|"to. But mind, as it tends towards the higher end to “merge itself in"|FALSE
39064|"light,” to identify itself yet not wholly lost, but retained, in the"|FALSE
39064|"fullness of undivided intellectual being, so at the lower end it springs"|FALSE
39064|"from a natural and underlying unity, the immense solidarity of"|FALSE
39064|"nether-soul, the great Soul of Nature—the “Substance” which is to be"|FALSE
39064|"raised into the “Subject” which is true divinity. Between these two"|FALSE
39064|"unities, the nature-given nether-soul and the spirit-won over-soul, lies"|FALSE
39064|"the conscious life of man: a process of differentiation which narrows and"|FALSE
39064|"of redintegration which enlarges,—which alternately builds up an isolated"|FALSE
39064|"personality and dissolves it in a common intelligence and sympathy. It is"|FALSE
39064|"because mental or tacit “suggestion”(88) (i.e. will-influence exercised"|FALSE
39064|"without word or sign, or other sensible mode of connexion),"|FALSE
39064|"thought-transference, or thought-reading (which is more than dexterous"|FALSE
39064|"apprehension of delicate muscular signs), exteriorisation or transposition"|FALSE
39064|"of sensibility into objects primarily non-sensitive, clairvoyance (i.e."|FALSE
39064|"the power of describing, as if from direct perception, objects or events"|FALSE
39064|"removed in space beyond the recognised limits of sensation), and"|FALSE
39064|"somnambulism, so far as it implies lucid vision with sealed eyes,—it is"|FALSE
39064|"because these things seem to show the essential ideality of matter, that"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel is interested in them. The ordinary conditions of consciousness and"|FALSE
39064|"even of practical life in society are a derivative and secondary state; a"|FALSE
39064|"product of processes of individualism, which however are never completed,"|FALSE
39064|"and leave a large margin for idealising intelligence to fulfil. From a"|FALSE
39064|"state which is not yet personality to a state which is more than can be"|FALSE
39064|"described as personality—lies the mental movement. So Fichte, too, had"|FALSE
39064|"regarded the power of the somnambulist as laying open a world underlying"|FALSE
39064|"the development of egoity and self-consciousness(89): “the merely sensuous"|FALSE
39064|"man is still in somnambulism,” only a somnambulism of waking hours: “the"|FALSE
39064|"true waking is the life in God, to be free in him, all else is sleep and"|FALSE
39064|"dream.” “Egoity,” he adds, “is a merely _formal_ principle, utterly, and"|FALSE
39064|"never qualitative (i.e. the essence and universal force).” For"|FALSE
39064|"Schopenhauer, too, the experiences of animal magnetism had seemed to prove"|FALSE
39064|"the absolute supernatural power of the radical will in its superiority to"|FALSE
39064|"the intellectual categories of space, time, and causal sequence: to prove"|FALSE
39064|"the reality of the metaphysical which is at the basis of all conscious"|FALSE
39064|"divisions."|FALSE
39064|"(iii.) The Development of Inner Freedom."|FALSE
39064|"The result of the first range in the process of psycho-genesis was to make"|FALSE
39064|"the body a sign and utterance of the Soul, with a fixed and determinate"|FALSE
39064|"type. The “anthropological process” has defined and settled the mere"|FALSE
39064|"general sentiency of soul into an individualised shape, a localised and"|FALSE
39064|"limited self, a bundle of habits. It has made the soul an Ego or self: a"|FALSE
39064|"power which looks out upon the world as a spectator, lifted above"|FALSE
39064|"immanence in the general tide of being, but only so lifted because it has"|FALSE
39064|"made itself one in the world of objects, a thing among things. The Mind"|FALSE
39064|"has reached the point of view of reflection. Instead of a general"|FALSE
39064|"identifiability with all nature, it has encased itself in a limited range,"|FALSE
39064|"from which it looks forth on what is now other than itself. If previously"|FALSE
39064|"it was mere inward sensibility, it is now sense, perceptive of an object"|FALSE
39064|"here and now, of an external world. The step has involved some price: and"|FALSE
39064|"that price is, that it has attained independence and self-hood at the cost"|FALSE
39064|"of surrendering the content it had hitherto held in one with itself. It is"|FALSE
39064|"now a blank receptivity, open to the impressions of an outside world: and"|FALSE
39064|"the changes which take place in its process of apprehension seem to it to"|FALSE
39064|"be given from outside. The world it perceives is a world of isolated and"|FALSE
39064|"independent objects: and it takes them as they are given. But a closer"|FALSE
39064|"insistance on the perception develops the implicit intelligence, which"|FALSE
39064|"makes it possible. The percipient mind is no mere recipiency or"|FALSE
39064|"susceptibility with its forms of time and space: it is spontaneously"|FALSE
39064|"active, it is the source of categories, or is an apperceptive power,—an"|FALSE
39064|"understanding. Consciousness, thus discovered to be a creative or"|FALSE
39064|"constructive faculty, is strictly speaking self-consciousness(90)."|FALSE
39064|"Self-consciousness appears at first in the selfish or narrowly egoistic"|FALSE
39064|"form of appetite and impulse. The intelligence which claims to mould and"|FALSE
39064|"construe the world of objects—which, in Kant’s phrase, professes to give"|FALSE
39064|"us nature—is implicitly the lord of that world. And that supremacy it"|FALSE
39064|"carries out as appetite—as destruction. The self is but a bundle of"|FALSE
39064|"wants—its supremacy over things is really subjection to them: the"|FALSE
39064|"satisfaction of appetite is baffled by a new desire which leaves it as it"|FALSE
39064|"was before. The development of self-consciousness to a more adequate shape"|FALSE
39064|"is represented by Hegel as taking place through the social struggle for"|FALSE
39064|"existence. Human beings, too, are in the first instance to the"|FALSE
39064|"uninstructed appetite or the primitive self-consciousness (which is simply"|FALSE
39064|"a succession of individual desires for satisfaction of natural want) only"|FALSE
39064|"things,—adjectival to that self’s individual existence. To them, too, his"|FALSE
39064|"primary relation is to appropriate and master them. Might precedes right."|FALSE
39064|"But the social struggle for existence forces him to recognise something"|FALSE
39064|"other which is kindred to himself,—a limiting principle, another self"|FALSE
39064|"which has to form an element in his calculations, not to be neglected. And"|FALSE
39064|"gradually, we may suppose, the result is the division of humanity into two"|FALSE
39064|"levels, a ruling lordly class, and a class of slaves,—a state of"|FALSE
39064|"inequality in which each knows that his appetite is in some measure"|FALSE
39064|"checked by a more or less permanent other. Lastly, perhaps soonest in the"|FALSE
39064|"inferior order, there is fashioned the perception that its self-seeking in"|FALSE
39064|"its isolated appetites is subject to an abiding authority, a continuing"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness. There grows up a social self—a sense of general humanity"|FALSE
39064|"and solidarity with other beings—a larger self with which each identifies"|FALSE
39064|"himself, a common ground. Understanding was selfish intelligence:"|FALSE
39064|"practical in the egoistic sense. In the altruistic or universal sense"|FALSE
39064|"practical, a principle social and unifying character, intelligence is"|FALSE
39064|"Reason."|FALSE
39064|"Thus, Man, beginning as a percipient consciousness, apprehending single"|FALSE
39064|"objects in space and time, and as an appetitive self bent upon single"|FALSE
39064|"gratifications, has ended as a rational being,—a consciousness purged of"|FALSE
39064|"its selfishness and isolation, looking forward openly and impartially on"|FALSE
39064|"the universe of things and beings. He has ceased to be a mere animal,"|FALSE
39064|"swallowed up in the moment and the individual, using his intelligence only"|FALSE
39064|"in selfish satisfactions. He is no longer bound down by the struggle for"|FALSE
39064|"existence, looking on everything as a mere thing, a mere means. He has"|FALSE
39064|"erected himself above himself and above his environment, but that because"|FALSE
39064|"he occupies a point of view at which he and his environment are no longer"|FALSE
39064|"purely antithetical and exclusive(91). He has reached what is really the"|FALSE
39064|"moral standpoint: the point i.e. at which he is inspired by a universal"|FALSE
39064|"self-consciousness, and lives in that peaceful world where the antitheses"|FALSE
39064|"of individualities and of outward and inward have ceased to trouble. “The"|FALSE
39064|"natural man,” says Hegel(92), “sees in the woman flesh of his flesh: the"|FALSE
39064|"moral and spiritual man sees spirit of his spirit in the moral and"|FALSE
39064|"spiritual being and by its means.” Hitherto we have been dealing with"|FALSE
39064|"something falling below the full truth of mind: the region of immediate"|FALSE
39064|"sensibility with its thorough immersion of mind in body, first of all, and"|FALSE
39064|"secondly its gradual progress to a general standpoint. It is only in the"|FALSE
39064|"third part of Subjective mind that we are dealing with the psychology of a"|FALSE
39064|"being who in the human sense knows and wills, i.e. apprehends general"|FALSE
39064|"truth, and carries out ideal purposes."|FALSE
39064|"Thus, for the third time, but now on a higher plane, that of intelligence"|FALSE
39064|"and rationality, is traced the process of development or realisation by"|FALSE
39064|"which reason becomes reasoned knowledge and rational will, a free or"|FALSE
39064|"autonomous intelligence. And, as before, the starting-point, alike in"|FALSE
39064|"theoretical and practical mind, is feeling—or immediate knowledge and"|FALSE
39064|"immediate sense of Ought. The basis of thought is an immediate"|FALSE
39064|"perception—a sensuous affection or given something, and the basis of the"|FALSE
39064|"idea of a general satisfaction is the natural claim to determine the"|FALSE
39064|"outward existence conformably to individual feeling. In intelligent"|FALSE
39064|"perception or intuition the important factor is attention, which raises it"|FALSE
39064|"above mere passive acceptance and awareness of a given fact. Attention"|FALSE
39064|"thus involves on one hand the externality of its object, and on the other"|FALSE
39064|"affirms its dependence on the act of the subject: it sets the objects"|FALSE
39064|"before and out of itself, in space and time, but yet in so doing it shows"|FALSE
39064|"itself master of the objects. If perception presuppose attention, in"|FALSE
39064|"short, they cease to be wholly outward: we make them ours, and the space"|FALSE
39064|"and time they fill are projected by us. So attended to, they are"|FALSE
39064|"appropriated, inwardised and recollected: they take their place in a"|FALSE
39064|"mental place and mental time: they receive a general or de-individualised"|FALSE
39064|"character in the memory-image. These are retained as mental property, but"|FALSE
39064|"retained actually only in so far they are revivable and revived. Such"|FALSE
39064|"revival is the work of imagination working by the so-called laws of"|FALSE
39064|"association. But the possession of its ideas thus inwardised and"|FALSE
39064|"recollected by the mind is largely a matter of chance. The mind is not"|FALSE
39064|"really fully master of them until it has been able to give them a certain"|FALSE
39064|"objectivity, by replacing the mental image by a vocal, i.e. a sensible"|FALSE
39064|"sign. By means of words, intelligence turns its ideas or representations"|FALSE
39064|"into quasi-realities: it creates a sort of superior sense-world, the world"|FALSE
39064|"of language, where ideas live a potential, which is also an actual, life."|FALSE
39064|"Words are sensibles, but they are sensibles which completely lose"|FALSE
39064|"themselves in their meaning. As sensibles, they render possible that"|FALSE
39064|"verbal memory which is the handmaid of thought: but which also as merely"|FALSE
39064|"mechanical can leave thought altogether out of account. It is through"|FALSE
39064|"words that thought is made possible: for it alone permits the movement"|FALSE
39064|"through ideas without being distracted through a multitude of"|FALSE
39064|"associations. In them thought has an instrument completely at its own"|FALSE
39064|"level, but still only a machine, and in memory the working of that"|FALSE
39064|"machine. We think in names, not in general images, but in terms which only"|FALSE
39064|"serve as vehicles for mental synthesis and analysis."|FALSE
39064|"It is as such a thinking being—a being who can use language, and"|FALSE

39064|"can be called will. At first indeed its material may be found as"|FALSE
39064|"immediately given and all its volitionality may lie in the circumstance"|FALSE
39064|"that the intelligent being sets this forward as a governing and"|FALSE
39064|"controlling Ought. Its vehicle, in short, may be mere impulse, or"|FALSE
39064|"inclination, and even passion: but it is the choice and the purposive"|FALSE
39064|"adoption of means to the given end. Gradually it attains to the idea of a"|FALSE
39064|"general satisfaction, or of happiness. And this end seems positive and"|FALSE
39064|"definite. It soon turns out however to be little but a prudent and"|FALSE
39064|"self-denying superiority to particular passions and inclinations in the"|FALSE
39064|"interest of a comprehensive ideal. The free will or intelligence has so"|FALSE
39064|"far only a negative and formal value: it is the perfection of an"|FALSE
39064|"autonomous and freely self-developing mind. Such a mind, which in language"|FALSE
39064|"has acquired the means of realising an intellectual system of things"|FALSE
39064|"superior to the restrictions of sense, and which has emancipated reason"|FALSE
39064|"from the position of slave to inclination, is endued with the formal"|FALSE
39064|"conditions of moral conduct. Such a mind will transform its own primarily"|FALSE
39064|"physical dependence into an image of the law of reason and create the"|FALSE
39064|"ethical life: and in the strength of that establishment will go forth to"|FALSE

39064|"“In dealing,” says Hegel, “with the Idea of the State, we must not have"|FALSE
39064|"before our eyes a particular state, or a particular institution: we must"|FALSE
39064|"rather study the Idea, this actual God, on his own account. Every State,"|FALSE
39064|"however bad we may find it according to our principles, however defective"|FALSE
39064|"we may discover this or that feature to be, still contains, particularly"|FALSE
39064|"if it belongs to the mature states of our time, all the essential factors"|FALSE
39064|"of its existence. But as it is easier to discover faults than to"|FALSE
39064|"comprehend the affirmative, people easily fall into the mistake of letting"|FALSE
39064|"individual aspects obscure the intrinsic organism of the State itself. The"|FALSE
39064|"State is no ideal work of art: it stands in the everyday world, in the"|FALSE
39064|"sphere, that is, of arbitrary act, accident, and error, and a variety of"|FALSE
39064|"faults may mar the regularity of its traits. But the ugliest man, the"|FALSE
39064|"criminal, a sick man and a cripple, is after all a living man; the"|FALSE
39064|"affirmative, Life, subsists in spite of the defect: and this affirmative"|FALSE
39064|"is here the theme(93).” “It is the theme of philosophy,” he adds, “to"|FALSE

39064|"transient, and the eternal which is present.”"|FALSE
39064|"(i.) Hegel as a Political Critic."|FALSE
39064|"But if this is true, it is also to be remembered that the philosopher is,"|FALSE
39064|"like other men, the son of his age, and estimates the value of reality"|FALSE
39064|"from preconceptions and aspirations due to his generation. The historical"|FALSE
39064|"circumstances of his nation as well as the personal experiences of his"|FALSE
39064|"life help to determine his horizon, even in the effort to discover the"|FALSE
39064|"hidden pulse and movement of the social organism. This is specially"|FALSE
39064|"obvious in political philosophy. The conception of ethics and politics"|FALSE
39064|"which is presented in the _Encyclopaedia_ was in 1820 produced with more"|FALSE
39064|"detail as the _Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts_. Appearing, as it"|FALSE
39064|"did, two years after his appointment to a professorship at Berlin, and in"|FALSE
39064|"the midst of a political struggle between the various revolutionary and"|FALSE
39064|"conservative powers and parties of Germany, the book became, and long"|FALSE
39064|"remained, a target for embittered criticism. The so-called War of"|FALSE
39064|"Liberation or national movement to shake off the French yoke was due to a"|FALSE
39064|"coalition of parties, and had naturally been in part supported by"|FALSE
39064|"tendencies and aims which went far beyond the ostensive purpose either of"|FALSE
39064|"leaders or of combatants. Aspirations after a freer state were entwined"|FALSE
39064|"with radical and socialistic designs to reform the political hierarchy of"|FALSE
39064|"the Fatherland: high ideals and low vulgarities were closely intermixed:"|FALSE
39064|"and the noble enthusiasm of youth was occasionally played on by criminal"|FALSE
39064|"and anarchic intriguers. In a strong and wise and united Germany some of"|FALSE
39064|"these schemes might have been tolerated. But strength, wisdom, and unity"|FALSE
39064|"were absent. In the existing tension between Austria and Prussia for the"|FALSE
39064|"leadership, in the ill-adapted and effete constitutions of the several"|FALSE
39064|"principalities which were yet expected to realise the advance which had"|FALSE
39064|"taken place in society and ideas during the last thirty years, the outlook"|FALSE
39064|"on every hand seemed darker and more threatening than it might have"|FALSE
39064|"otherwise done. Governments, which had lost touch with their peoples,"|FALSE
39064|"suspected conspiracy and treason: and a party in the nation credited their"|FALSE
39064|"rulers with gratuitous designs against private liberty and rights. There"|FALSE
39064|"was a vast but ill-defined enthusiasm in the breasts of the younger world,"|FALSE
39064|"and it was shared by many of their teachers. It seemed to their immense"|FALSE
39064|"aspirations that the war of liberation had failed of its true object and"|FALSE
39064|"left things much as they were. The volunteers had not fought for the"|FALSE
39064|"political systems of Austria or Prussia, or for the three-and-thirty"|FALSE
39064|"princes of Germany: but for ideas, vague, beautiful, stimulating. To such"|FALSE
39064|"a mood the continuance of the old system was felt as a cruel deception and"|FALSE
39064|"a reaction. The governments on their part had not realised the full"|FALSE
39064|"importance of the spirit that had been aroused, and could not at a"|FALSE
39064|"moment’s notice set their house in order, even had there been a clearer"|FALSE
39064|"outlook for reform than was offered. They too had suffered, and had"|FALSE
39064|"realised their insecurity: and were hardly in a mood to open their gates"|FALSE
39064|"to the enemy."|FALSE
39064|"Coming on such a situation of affairs, Hegel’s book would have been likely"|FALSE
39064|"in any case to provoke criticism. For it took up a line of political"|FALSE
39064|"theory which was little in accord with the temper of the age. The"|FALSE
39064|"conception of the state which it expounded is not far removed in"|FALSE
39064|"essentials from the conception which now dominates the political life of"|FALSE
39064|"the chief European nations. But in his own time it came upon ears which"|FALSE
39064|"were naturally disposed to misconceive it. It was unacceptable to the"|FALSE
39064|"adherents of the _ancien régime_, as much as to the liberals. It was"|FALSE
39064|"declared by one party to be a glorification of the Prussian state: by"|FALSE
39064|"another to rationalise the sanctities of authority. It was pointed out"|FALSE
39064|"that the new professor was a favourite of the leading minister, that his"|FALSE
39064|"influence was dominant in scholastic appointments, and that occasional"|FALSE
39064|"gratuities from the crown proved his acceptability. A contemporary"|FALSE
39064|"professor, Fries, remarked that Hegel’s theory of the state had grown “not"|FALSE
39064|"in the gardens of science but on the dung-hill of servility.” Hegel"|FALSE
39064|"himself was aware that he had planted a blow in the face of a “shallow and"|FALSE
39064|"pretentious sect,” and that his book had “given great offence to the"|FALSE
39064|"demagogic folk.” Alike in religious and political life he was impatient of"|FALSE
39064|"sentimentalism, of rhetorical feeling, of wordy enthusiasm. A positive"|FALSE
39064|"storm of scorn burst from him at much-promising and little-containing"|FALSE
39064|"declamation that appealed to the pathos of ideas, without sense of the"|FALSE
39064|"complex work of construction and the system of principles which were"|FALSE
39064|"needed to give them reality. His impatience of demagogic gush led him (in"|FALSE
39064|"the preface) into a tactless attack on Fries, who was at the moment in"|FALSE
39064|"disgrace for his participation in the demonstration at the Wartburg. It"|FALSE
39064|"led him to an attack on the bumptiousness of those who held that"|FALSE
39064|"conscientious conviction was ample justification for any proceeding:—an"|FALSE
39064|"attack which opponents were not unwilling to represent as directed against"|FALSE
39064|"the principle of conscience itself."|FALSE
39064|"Yet Hegel’s views on the nature of political unity were not new. Their"|FALSE
39064|"nucleus had been formed nearly twenty years before. In the years that"|FALSE
39064|"immediately followed the French revolution he had gone through the usual"|FALSE
39064|"anarchic stage of intelligent youth. He had wondered whether humanity"|FALSE
39064|"might not have had a nobler destiny, had fate given supremacy to some"|FALSE
39064|"heresy rather than the orthodox creed of Christendom. He had seen religion"|FALSE
39064|"in the past “teaching what despotism wished,—contempt of the human race,"|FALSE
39064|"its incapacity for anything good(94).” But his earliest reflections on"|FALSE
39064|"political power belong to a later date, and are inspired, not so much by"|FALSE
39064|"the vague ideals of humanitarianism, as by the spirit of national"|FALSE
39064|"patriotism. They are found in a “Criticism of the German Constitution”"|FALSE
39064|"apparently dating from the year 1802(95). It is written after the peace of"|FALSE
39064|"Lunéville had sealed for Germany the loss of her provinces west of the"|FALSE
39064|"Rhine, and subsequent to the disasters of the German arms at Hohenlinden"|FALSE
39064|"and Marengo. It is almost contemporaneous with the measures of 1803 and"|FALSE
39064|"1804, which affirmed the dissolution of the “Holy Roman Empire” of German"|FALSE
39064|"name. The writer of this unpublished pamphlet sees his country in a"|FALSE
39064|"situation almost identical with that which Macchiavelli saw around him in"|FALSE
39064|"Italy. It is abused by petty despots, distracted by mean particularist"|FALSE
39064|"ambitions, at the mercy of every foreign power. It was such a scene which,"|FALSE
39064|"as Hegel recalls, had prompted and justified the drastic measures proposed"|FALSE
39064|"in the _Prince_,—measures which have been ill-judged by the closet"|FALSE
39064|"moralist, but evince the high statesmanship of the Florentine. In the"|FALSE
39064|"_Prince_, an intelligent reader can see “the enthusiasm of patriotism"|FALSE
39064|"underlying the cold and dispassionate doctrines.” Macchiavelli dared to"|FALSE
39064|"declare that Italy must become a state, and to assert that “there is no"|FALSE
39064|"higher duty for a state than to maintain itself, and to punish"|FALSE
39064|"relentlessly every author of anarchy,—the supreme, and perhaps sole"|FALSE
39064|"political crime.” And like teaching, Hegel adds, is needed for Germany."|FALSE
39064|"Only, he concludes, no mere demonstration of the insanity of utter"|FALSE
39064|"separation of the particular from his kin will ever succeed in converting"|FALSE
39064|"the particularists from their conviction of the absoluteness of personal"|FALSE
39064|"and private rights. “Insight and intelligence always excite so much"|FALSE
39064|"distrust that force alone avails to justify them; then man yields them"|FALSE
39064|"obedience(96).”"|FALSE
39064|"“The German political edifice,” says the writer, “is nothing else but the"|FALSE
39064|"sum of the rights which the single parts have withdrawn from the whole;"|FALSE
39064|"and this justice, which is ever on the watch to prevent the state having"|FALSE
39064|"any power left, is the essence of the constitution.” The Peace of"|FALSE
39064|"Westphalia had but served to constitute or stereotype anarchy: the German"|FALSE
39064|"empire had by that instrument divested itself of all rights of political"|FALSE
39064|"unity, and thrown itself on the goodwill of its members. What then, it may"|FALSE
39064|"be asked, is, in Hegel’s view, the indispensable minimum essential to a"|FALSE
39064|"state? And the answer will be, organised strength,—a central and united"|FALSE
39064|"force. “The strength of a country lies neither in the multitude of its"|FALSE
39064|"inhabitants and fighting men, nor in its fertility, nor in its size, but"|FALSE
39064|"solely in the way its parts are by reasonable combination made a single"|FALSE
39064|"political force enabling everything to be used for the common defence.”"|FALSE
39064|"Hegel speaks scornfully of “the philanthropists and moralists who decry"|FALSE
39064|"politics as an endeavour and an art to seek private utility at the cost of"|FALSE
39064|"right”: he tells them that “it is foolish to oppose the interest or (as it"|FALSE
39064|"is expressed by the more morally-obnoxious word) the utility of the state"|FALSE
39064|"to its right”: that the “rights of a state are the utility of the state as"|FALSE
39064|"established and recognised by compacts”: and that “war” (which they would"|FALSE
39064|"fain abolish or moralise) “has to decide not which of the rights asserted"|FALSE
39064|"by either party is the true right (—for both parties have a true right),"|FALSE
39064|"but which right has to give way to the other.”"|FALSE
39064|"It is evident from these propositions that Hegel takes that view of"|FALSE
39064|"political supremacy which has been associated with the name of Hobbes. But"|FALSE
39064|"his views also reproduce the Platonic king of men, “who can rule and dare"|FALSE
39064|"not lie.” “All states,” he declares, “are founded by the sublime force of"|FALSE
39064|"great men, not by physical strength. The great man has something in his"|FALSE
39064|"features which others would gladly call their lord. They obey him against"|FALSE
39064|"their will. Their immediate will is his will, but their conscious will is"|FALSE
39064|"otherwise.... This is the prerogative of the great man to ascertain and to"|FALSE
39064|"express the absolute will. All gather round his banner. He is their God.”"|FALSE
39064|"“The state,” he says again, “is the self-certain absolute mind which"|FALSE
39064|"recognises no definite authority but its own: which acknowledges no"|FALSE
39064|"abstract rules of good and bad, shameful and mean, craft and deception.”"|FALSE
39064|"So also Hobbes describes the prerogatives of the sovereign Leviathan. But"|FALSE
39064|"the Hegelian God immanent in the state is a higher power than Hobbes"|FALSE
39064|"knows: he is no mortal, but in his truth an immortal God. He speaks by"|FALSE
39064|"(what in this early essay is called) the Absolute Government(97): the"|FALSE
39064|"government of the Law—the true impersonal sovereign,—distinct alike from"|FALSE
39064|"the single ruler and the multitude of the ruled. “It is absolutely only"|FALSE
39064|"universality as against particular. As this absolute, ideal, universal,"|FALSE
39064|"compared to which everything else is a particular, it is the phenomenon of"|FALSE
39064|"God. Its words are his decision, and it can appear and exist under no"|FALSE
39064|"other form.... The Absolute government is divine, self-sanctioned and not"|FALSE
39064|"made(98).” The real strength—the real connecting-mean which gives life to"|FALSE
39064|"sovereign and to subject—is intelligence free and entire, independent both"|FALSE
39064|"of what individuals feel and believe and of the quality of the ruler. “The"|FALSE
39064|"spiritual bond,” he says in a lower form of speech, “is public opinion: it"|FALSE
39064|"is the true legislative body, national assembly, declaration of the"|FALSE
39064|"universal will which lives in the execution of all commands.” This still"|FALSE
39064|"small voice of public opinion is the true and real parliament: not"|FALSE
39064|"literally making laws, but revealing them. If we ask, where does this"|FALSE
39064|"public opinion appear and how does it disengage itself from the masses of"|FALSE
39064|"partisan judgment? Hegel answers,—and to the surprise of those who have"|FALSE
39064|"not entered into the spirit of his age(99)—it is embodied in the Aged and"|FALSE
39064|"the Priests. Both of these have ceased to live in the real world: they are"|FALSE
39064|"by nature and function disengaged from the struggles of particular"|FALSE
39064|"existence, have risen above the divergencies of social classes. They"|FALSE
39064|"breathe the ether of pure contemplation. “The sunset of life gives them"|FALSE
39064|"mystical lore,” or at least removes from old age the distraction of"|FALSE
39064|"selfishness: while the priest is by function set apart from the divisions"|FALSE
39064|"of human interest. Understood in a large sense, Hegel’s view is that the"|FALSE
39064|"real voice of experience is elicited through those who have attained"|FALSE
39064|"indifference to the distorting influence of human parties, and who see"|FALSE
39064|"life steadily and whole."|FALSE
39064|"If this utterance shows the little belief Hegel had in the ordinary"|FALSE
39064|"methods of legislation through “representative” bodies, and hints that the"|FALSE
39064|"real _substance_ of political life is deeper than the overt machinery of"|FALSE
39064|"political operation, it is evident that this theory of “divine right” is"|FALSE
39064|"of a different stamp from what used to go under that name. And, again,"|FALSE
39064|"though the power of the central state is indispensable, he is far from"|FALSE
39064|"agreeing with the so-called bureaucratic view that “a state is a machine"|FALSE
39064|"with a single spring which sets in motion all the rest of the machinery.”"|FALSE
39064|"“Everything,” he says, “which is not directly required to organise and"|FALSE
39064|"maintain the force for giving security without and within must be left by"|FALSE
39064|"the central government to the freedom of the citizens. Nothing ought to be"|FALSE
39064|"so sacred in the eyes of a government as to leave alone and to protect,"|FALSE
39064|"without regard to utilities, the free action of the citizens in such"|FALSE
39064|"matters as do not affect its fundamental aim: for this freedom is itself"|FALSE
39064|"sacred(100).” He is no friend of paternal bureaucracy. “The pedantic"|FALSE
39064|"craving to settle every detail, the mean jealousy against estates and"|FALSE
39064|"corporations administrating and directing their own affairs, the base"|FALSE
39064|"fault-finding with all independent action on the part of the citizens,"|FALSE
39064|"even when it has no immediate bearing on the main political interest, has"|FALSE
39064|"been decked out with reasons to show that no penny of public expenditure,"|FALSE
39064|"made for a country of twenty or thirty millions’ population, can be laid"|FALSE
39064|"out, without first being, not permitted, but commanded, controlled and"|FALSE
39064|"revised by the supreme government.” You can see, he remarks, in the first"|FALSE
39064|"village after you enter Prussian territory the lifeless and wooden routine"|FALSE
39064|"which prevails. The whole country suffers also from the way religion has"|FALSE
39064|"been mixed up with political rights, and a particular creed pronounced by"|FALSE
39064|"law indispensable both for sovereign and full-privileged subject. In a"|FALSE
39064|"word, the unity and vigour of the state is quite compatible with"|FALSE
39064|"considerable latitude and divergence in laws and judicature, in the"|FALSE
39064|"imposition and levying of taxes, in language, manners, civilisation and"|FALSE
39064|"religion. Equality in all these points is desirable for social unity: but"|FALSE
39064|"it is not indispensable for political strength."|FALSE
39064|"This decided preference for the unity of the state against the system of"|FALSE
39064|"checks and counterchecks, which sometimes goes by the name of a"|FALSE
39064|"constitution, came out clearly in Hegel’s attitude in discussing the"|FALSE
39064|"dispute between the Würtembergers and their sovereign in 1815-16."|FALSE
39064|"Würtemberg, with its complicated aggregation of local laws, had always"|FALSE
39064|"been a paradise of lawyers, and the feudal rights or privileges of the"|FALSE
39064|"local oligarchies—the so-called “good old law”—were the boast of the"|FALSE
39064|"country. All this had however been aggravated by the increase of territory"|FALSE
39064|"received in 1805: and the king, following the examples set by France and"|FALSE
39064|"even by Bavaria, promulgated of his own grace a “constitution” remodelling"|FALSE
39064|"the electoral system of the country. Immediately an outcry burst out"|FALSE
39064|"against the attempt to destroy the ancient liberties. Uhland tuned his"|FALSE
39064|"lyre to the popular cry: Rückert sang on the king’s side. To Hegel the"|FALSE
39064|"contest presented itself as a struggle between the attachment to"|FALSE
39064|"traditional rights, merely because they are old, and the resolution to"|FALSE
39064|"carry out reasonable reform whether it be agreeable to the reformed or"|FALSE
39064|"not: or rather he saw in it resistance of particularism, of separation,"|FALSE
39064|"clinging to use and wont, and basing itself on formal pettifogging"|FALSE
39064|"objections, against the spirit of organisation. Anything more he declined"|FALSE
39064|"to see. And probably he was right in ascribing a large part of the"|FALSE
39064|"opposition to inertia, to vanity and self-interest, combined with the want"|FALSE
39064|"of political perception of the needs of Würtemberg and Germany. But on the"|FALSE
39064|"other hand, he failed to remember the insecurity and danger of such “gifts"|FALSE
39064|"of the Danai”: he forgot the sense of free-born men that a constitution is"|FALSE
39064|"not something to be granted (_octroyé_) as a grace, but something that"|FALSE
39064|"must come by the spontaneous act of the innermost self of the community."|FALSE
39064|"He dealt rather with the formal arguments which were used to refuse"|FALSE
39064|"progress, than with the underlying spirit which prompted the"|FALSE
39064|"opposition(101)."|FALSE
39064|"The philosopher lives (as Plato has well reminded us) too exclusively"|FALSE
39064|"within the ideal. Bent on the essential nucleus of institutions, he"|FALSE
39064|"attaches but slight importance to the variety of externals, and fails to"|FALSE
39064|"realise the practice of the law-courts. He forgets that what weighs"|FALSE
39064|"lightly in logic, may turn the scale in real life and experience. For"|FALSE
39064|"feeling and sentiment he has but scant respect: he is brusque and"|FALSE
39064|"uncompromising: and cannot realise all the difficulties and dangers that"|FALSE
39064|"beset the Idea in the mazes of the world, and may ultimately quite alter a"|FALSE
39064|"plan which at first seemed independent of petty details. Better than other"|FALSE
39064|"men perhaps he recognises in theory how the mere universal only exists"|FALSE
39064|"complete in an individual shape: but more than other men he forgets these"|FALSE
39064|"truths of insight, when the business of life calls for action or for"|FALSE
39064|"judgment. He cannot at a moment’s notice remember that he is, if not, as"|FALSE
39064|"Cicero says, _in faece Romuli_, the member of a degenerate commonwealth,"|FALSE
39064|"at least living in a world where good and evil are not, as logic"|FALSE
39064|"presupposes, sharply divided but intricately intertwined."|FALSE
39064|"(ii.) The Ethics and Religion of the State."|FALSE
39064|"This idealism of political theory is illustrated by the sketch of the"|FALSE
39064|"Ethical Life which he drew up about 1802. Under the name of “Ethical"|FALSE
39064|"System” it presents in concentrated or undeveloped shape the doctrine"|FALSE
39064|"which subsequently swelled into the “Philosophy of Mind.” At a later date"|FALSE
39064|"he worked out more carefully as introduction the psychological genesis of"|FALSE
39064|"moral and intelligent man, and he separated out more distinctly as a"|FALSE
39064|"sequel the universal powers which give to social life its higher"|FALSE
39064|"characters. In the earlier sketch the Ethical Part stands by itself, with"|FALSE
39064|"the consequence that Ethics bears a meaning far exceeding all that had"|FALSE
39064|"been lately called moral. The word “moral” itself he avoids(102). It"|FALSE
39064|"savours of excessive subjectivity, of struggle, of duty and conscience. It"|FALSE
39064|"has an ascetic ring about it—an aspect of negation, which seeks for"|FALSE
39064|"abstract holiness, and turns its back on human nature. Kant’s words"|FALSE
39064|"opposing duty to inclination, and implying that moral goodness involves a"|FALSE
39064|"struggle, an antagonism, a victory, seem to him (and to his time)"|FALSE
39064|"one-sided. That aspect of negation accordingly which Kant certainly began"|FALSE
39064|"with, and which Schopenhauer magnified until it became the all-in-all of"|FALSE
39064|"Ethics, Hegel entirely subordinates. Equally little does he like the"|FALSE
39064|"emphasis on the supremacy of insight, intention, conscience: they lead, he"|FALSE
39064|"thinks, to a view which holds the mere fact of conviction to be"|FALSE
39064|"all-important, as if it mattered not what we thought and believed and did,"|FALSE
39064|"so long as we were sincere in our belief. All this emphasis on the"|FALSE
39064|"good-will, on the imperative of duty, on the rights of conscience, has, he"|FALSE
39064|"admits, its justification in certain circumstances, as against mere"|FALSE
39064|"legality, or mere natural instinctive goodness; but it has been overdone."|FALSE
39064|"Above all, it errs by an excess of individualism. It springs from an"|FALSE
39064|"attitude of reflection,—in which the individual, isolated in his conscious"|FALSE
39064|"and superficial individuality, yet tries—but probably tries in vain—to get"|FALSE
39064|"somewhat in touch with a universal which he has allowed to slip outside"|FALSE
39064|"him, forgetting that it is the heart and substance of his life. Kant,"|FALSE
39064|"indeed, hardly falls under this condemnation. For he aims at showing that"|FALSE
39064|"the rational will inevitably creates as rational a law or universal; that"|FALSE
39064|"the individual act becomes self-regulative, and takes its part in"|FALSE
39064|"constituting a system or realm of duty."|FALSE
39064|"Still, on the whole, “morality” in this narrower sense belongs to an age"|FALSE
39064|"of reflection, and is formal or nominal goodness rather than the genuine"|FALSE
39064|"and full reality. It is the protest against mere instinctive or customary"|FALSE
39064|"virtue, which is but compliance with traditional authority, and compliance"|FALSE
39064|"with it as if it were a sort of quasi-natural law. Moralising reflection"|FALSE
39064|"is the awakening of subjectivity and of a deeper personality. The age"|FALSE
39064|"which thus precedes morality is not an age in which kindness, or love, or"|FALSE
39064|"generosity is unknown. And if Hegel says that “Morality,” strictly so"|FALSE
39064|"called, began with Socrates, he does not thereby accuse the pre-Socratic"|FALSE
39064|"Greeks of inhumanity. But what he does say is that such ethical life as"|FALSE
39064|"existed was in the main a thing of custom and law: of law, moreover, which"|FALSE
39064|"was not set objectively forward, but left still in the stage of"|FALSE
39064|"uncontradicted usage, a custom which was a second nature, part of the"|FALSE
39064|"essential and quasi-physical ordinance of life. The individual had not yet"|FALSE
39064|"learned to set his self-consciousness against these usages and ask for"|FALSE
39064|"their justification. These are like the so-called law of the Medes and"|FALSE
39064|"Persians which alters not: customs of immemorial antiquity and"|FALSE
39064|"unquestionable sway. They are part of a system of things with which for"|FALSE
39064|"good or evil the individual is utterly identified, bound as it were hand"|FALSE
39064|"and foot. These are, as a traveller says(103), “oral and unwritten"|FALSE
39064|"traditions which teach that certain rules of conduct are to be observed"|FALSE
39064|"under certain penalties; and without the aid of fixed records, or the"|FALSE
39064|"intervention of a succession of authorised depositaries and expounders,"|FALSE
39064|"these laws have been transmitted to father and son, through unknown"|FALSE
39064|"generations, and are fixed in the minds of the people as sacred and"|FALSE
39064|"unalterable.”"|FALSE
39064|"The antithesis then in Hegel, as in Kant, is between Law and Morality, or"|FALSE
39064|"rather Legality and Morality,—two abstractions to which human development"|FALSE
39064|"is alternately prone to attach supreme importance. The first stage in the"|FALSE
39064|"objectivation of intelligence or in the evolution of personality is the"|FALSE
39064|"constitution of mere, abstract, or strict right. It is the creation of"|FALSE
39064|"institutions and uniformities, i.e. of laws, or rights, which express"|FALSE
39064|"definite and stereotyped modes of behaviour. Or, if we look at it from the"|FALSE
39064|"individual’s standpoint, we may say his consciousness awakes to find the"|FALSE
39064|"world parcelled out under certain rules and divisions, which have"|FALSE
39064|"objective validity, and govern him with the same absolute authority as do"|FALSE
39064|"the circumstances of physical nature. Under their influence every rank and"|FALSE
39064|"individual is alike forced to bow: to each his place and function is"|FALSE
39064|"assigned by an order or system which claims an inviolable and eternal"|FALSE
39064|"supremacy. It is not the same place and function for each: but for each"|FALSE
39064|"the position and duties are predetermined in this metaphysically-physical"|FALSE
39064|"order. The situation and its duties have been created by super-human and"|FALSE
39064|"natural ordinance. As the Platonic myth puts it, each order in the social"|FALSE
39064|"hierarchy has been framed underground by powers that turned out men of"|FALSE
39064|"gold, and silver, and baser metal: or as the Norse legend tells, they are"|FALSE
39064|"the successive offspring of the white God, Heimdal, in his dealings with"|FALSE
39064|"womankind."|FALSE
39064|"The central idea of the earlier social world is the supremacy of"|FALSE
39064|"rights—but not of right. The sum (for it cannot be properly called a"|FALSE
39064|"system) of rights is a self-subsistent world, to which man is but a"|FALSE
39064|"servant; and a second peculiarity of it is its inequality. If all are"|FALSE
39064|"equal before the laws, this only means here that the laws, with their"|FALSE
39064|"absolute and thorough inequality, are indifferent to the real and personal"|FALSE
39064|"diversities of individuals. Even the so-called equality of primitive law"|FALSE
39064|"is of the “Eye-for-eye, Tooth-for-tooth” kind; it takes no note of special"|FALSE
39064|"circumstances; it looks abstractly and rudely at facts, and maintains a"|FALSE
39064|"hard and fast uniformity, which seems the height of unfairness. Rule"|FALSE
39064|"stands by rule, usage beside usage,—a mere aggregate or multitude of petty"|FALSE
39064|"tyrants, reduced to no unity or system, and each pressing with all the"|FALSE
39064|"weight of an absolute mandate. The pettiest bit of ceremonial law is here"|FALSE
39064|"of equal dignity with the most far-reaching principle of political"|FALSE
39064|"obligation."|FALSE
39064|"In the essay already referred to, Hegel has designated something analogous"|FALSE
39064|"to this as Natural or Physical Ethics, or as Ethics in its relative or"|FALSE
39064|"comparative stage. Here Man first shows his superiority to nature, or"|FALSE
39064|"enters on his properly ethical function, by transforming the physical"|FALSE
39064|"world into his possession. He makes himself the lord of natural"|FALSE
39064|"objects—stamping them as his, and not their own, making them his permanent"|FALSE
39064|"property, his tools, his instruments of exchange and production. The"|FALSE
39064|"fundamental ethical act is appropriation by labour, and the first ethical"|FALSE
39064|"world is the creation of an economic system, the institution of property."|FALSE
39064|"For property, or at least possession and appropriation, is the dominant"|FALSE
39064|"idea, with its collateral and sequent principles. And at first, even human"|FALSE
39064|"beings are treated on the same method as other things: as objects in a"|FALSE
39064|"world of objects or aggregate of things: as things to be used and"|FALSE
39064|"acquired, as means and instruments,—not in any sense as ends in"|FALSE
39064|"themselves. It is a world in which the relation of master and slave is"|FALSE
39064|"dominant,—where owner and employer is set in antithesis against his tools"|FALSE
39064|"and chattels. But the Nemesis of his act issues in making the individual"|FALSE
39064|"the servant of his so-called property. He has become an objective power by"|FALSE
39064|"submitting himself to objectivity: he has literally put himself into the"|FALSE
39064|"object he has wrought, and is now a thing among things: for what he owns,"|FALSE
39064|"what he has appropriated, determines what he is. The real powers in the"|FALSE
39064|"world thus established are the laws of possession-holding: the laws"|FALSE
39064|"dominate man: and he is only freed from dependence on casual externals, by"|FALSE
39064|"making himself thoroughly the servant of his possessions."|FALSE
39064|"The only salvation, and it is but imperfect, that can be reached on this"|FALSE
39064|"stage is by the family union. The sexual tie, is at first entirely on a"|FALSE
39064|"level with the other arrangements of the sphere. The man or woman is but a"|FALSE
39064|"chattel and a tool; a casual appropriation which gradually is transformed"|FALSE
39064|"into a permanent possession and a permanent bond(104). But, as the family"|FALSE
39064|"constituted itself, it helped to afford a promise of better things. An"|FALSE
39064|"ideal interest—the religion of the household—extending beyond the"|FALSE
39064|"individual, and beyond the moment,—binding past and present, and parents"|FALSE
39064|"to offspring, gave a new character to the relation of property. Parents"|FALSE
39064|"and children form a unity, which overrides and essentially permeates their"|FALSE
39064|"“difference” from each other: there is no exchange, no contract, nor, in"|FALSE
39064|"the stricter sense, property between the members. In the property-idea"|FALSE
39064|"they are lifted out of their isolation, and in the continuity of family"|FALSE
39064|"life there is a certain analogue of immortality. But, says Hegel, “though"|FALSE
39064|"the family be the highest totality of which Nature is capable, the"|FALSE
39064|"absolute identity is in it still inward, and is not instituted in absolute"|FALSE
39064|"form; and hence, too, the reproduction of the totality is an appearance,"|FALSE
39064|"the appearance of the children(105).” “The power and the intelligence, the"|FALSE
39064|"‘difference’ of the parents, stands in inverse proportion to the youth and"|FALSE
39064|"vigour of the child: and these two sides of life flee from and are sequent"|FALSE
39064|"on each other, and are reciprocally external(106).” Or, as we may put it,"|FALSE
39064|"the god of the family is a departed ancestor, a ghost in the land of the"|FALSE
39064|"dead: it has not really a continuous and unified life. In such a state of"|FALSE
39064|"society—a state of nature—and in its supreme form, the family, there is no"|FALSE
39064|"adequate principle which though real shall still give ideality and unity"|FALSE
39064|"to the self-isolating aspects of life. There is wanted something which"|FALSE
39064|"shall give expression to its “indifference,” which shall control the"|FALSE
39064|"tendency of this partial moralisation to sink at every moment into"|FALSE
39064|"individuality, and lift it from its immersion in nature. Family life and"|FALSE
39064|"economic groups (—for these two, which Hegel subsequently separates, are"|FALSE
39064|"here kept close together) need an ampler and wider life to keep them from"|FALSE
39064|"stagnating in their several selfishnesses."|FALSE
39064|"This freshening and corrective influence they get in the first instance"|FALSE
39064|"from deeds of violence and crime. Here is the “negative unsettling” of the"|FALSE
39064|"narrow fixities, of the determinate conditions or relationships into which"|FALSE
39064|"the preceding processes of labour and acquisition have tended to"|FALSE
39064|"stereotype life. The harsh restriction brings about its own undoing. Man"|FALSE
39064|"may subject natural objects to his formative power, but the wild rage of"|FALSE
39064|"senseless devastation again and again bursts forth to restore the original"|FALSE
39064|"formlessness. He may build up his own pile of wealth, store up his private"|FALSE
39064|"goods, but the thief and the robber with the instincts of barbarian"|FALSE
39064|"socialism tread on his steps: and every stage of appropriation has for its"|FALSE
39064|"sequel a crop of acts of dispossession. He may secure by accumulation his"|FALSE
39064|"future life; but the murderer for gain’s sake cuts it short. And out of"|FALSE
39064|"all this as a necessary consequence stands avenging justice. And in the"|FALSE
39064|"natural world of ethics—where true moral life has not yet arisen—this is"|FALSE
39064|"mere retaliation or the _lex talionis_;—the beginning of an endless series"|FALSE
39064|"of vengeance and counter-vengeance, the blood-feud. Punishment, in the"|FALSE
39064|"stricter sense of the term,—which looks both to antecedents and effects in"|FALSE
39064|"character—cannot yet come into existence; for to punish there must be"|FALSE
39064|"something superior to individualities, an ethical idea embodied in an"|FALSE
39064|"institution, to which the injurer and the injured alike belong. But as yet"|FALSE
39064|"punishment is only vengeance, the personal and natural equivalent, the"|FALSE
39064|"physical reaction against injury, perhaps regulated and formulated by"|FALSE
39064|"custom and usage, but not essentially altered from its purely retaliatory"|FALSE
39064|"character. These crimes—or transgressions—are thus by Hegel quaintly"|FALSE
39064|"conceived as storms which clear the air—which shake the individualist out"|FALSE
39064|"of his slumber. The scene in which transgression thus acts is that of the"|FALSE
39064|"so-called state of nature, where particularism was rampant: where moral"|FALSE
39064|"right was not, but only the right of nature, of pre-occupation, of the"|FALSE
39064|"stronger, of the first maker and discoverer. Crime is thus the “dialectic”"|FALSE
39064|"which shakes the fixity of practical arrangements, and calls for something"|FALSE
39064|"in which the idea of a higher unity, a permanent substance of life, shall"|FALSE
39064|"find realisation."|FALSE
39064|"The “positive supersession(107)” of individualism and naturalism in ethics"|FALSE
39064|"is by Hegel called “Absolute Ethics.” Under this title he describes the"|FALSE
39064|"ethics and religion of the state—a religion which is immanent in the"|FALSE
39064|"community, and an ethics which rises superior to particularity. The"|FALSE
39064|"picture he draws is a romance fashioned upon the model of the Greek"|FALSE
39064|"commonwealth as that had been idealised by Greek literature and by the"|FALSE
39064|"longings of later ages for a freer life. It is but one of the many modes"|FALSE
39064|"in which Helena—to quote Goethe—has fascinated the German Faust. He dreams"|FALSE
39064|"himself away from the prosaic worldliness of a German municipality to the"|FALSE
39064|"unfading splendour of the Greek city with its imagined coincidence of"|FALSE
39064|"individual will with universal purpose. There is in such a commonwealth no"|FALSE
39064|"pain of surrender and of sacrifice, and no subsequent compensation: for,"|FALSE
39064|"at the very moment of resigning self-will to common aims, he enjoys it"|FALSE
39064|"retained with the added zest of self-expansion. He is not so left to"|FALSE
39064|"himself as to feel from beyond the restraint of a law which controls—even"|FALSE
39064|"if it wisely and well controls—individual effort. There is for his happy"|FALSE
39064|"circumstances no possibility of doing otherwise. Or, it may be, Hegel has"|FALSE
39064|"reminiscences from the ideals of other nations than the Greek. He recalls"|FALSE
39064|"the Israelite depicted by the Law-adoring psalmist, whose delight is to do"|FALSE
39064|"the will of the Lord, whom the zeal of God’s house has consumed, whose"|FALSE
39064|"whole being runs on in one pellucid stream with the universal and eternal"|FALSE
39064|"stream of divine commandment. Such a frame of spirit, where the empirical"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness with all its soul and strength and mind identifies its"|FALSE
39064|"mission into conformity with the absolute order, is the mood of absolute"|FALSE
39064|"Ethics. It is what some have spoken of as the True life, as the Eternal"|FALSE
39064|"life; in it, says Hegel, the individual exists _auf ewige Weise_(108), as"|FALSE
39064|"it were _sub specie aeternitatis_: his life is hid with his fellows in the"|FALSE
39064|"common life of his people. His every act, and thought, and will, get their"|FALSE
39064|"being and significance from a reality which is established in him as a"|FALSE
39064|"permanent spirit. It is there that he, in the fuller sense, attains"|FALSE
39064|"αὐτάρκεια, or finds himself no longer a mere part, but an ideal totality."|FALSE
39064|"This totality is realised under the particular form of a Nation (_Volk_),"|FALSE
39064|"which in the visible sphere represents (or rather is, as a particular) the"|FALSE
39064|"absolute and infinite. Such a unity is neither the mere sum of isolated"|FALSE
39064|"individuals, nor a mere majority ruling by numbers: but the fraternal and"|FALSE
39064|"organic commonwealth which brings all classes and all rights from their"|FALSE
39064|"particularistic independence into an ideal identity and indifference(109)."|FALSE
39064|"Here all are not merely equal before the laws: but the law itself is a"|FALSE
39064|"living and organic unity, self-correcting, subordinating and organising,"|FALSE
39064|"and no longer merely defining individual privileges and so-called"|FALSE
39064|"liberties. “In such conjunction of the universal with the particularity"|FALSE
39064|"lies the divinity of a nation: or, if we give this universal a separate"|FALSE
39064|"place in our ideas, it is the God of the nation.” But in this complete"|FALSE
39064|"accordance between concept and intuition, between visible and invisible,"|FALSE
39064|"where symbol and significate are one, religion and ethics are"|FALSE
39064|"indistinguishable. It is the old conception (and in its highest sense) of"|FALSE
39064|"Theocracy(110). God is the national head and the national life: and in him"|FALSE
39064|"all individuals have their “difference” rendered “indifferent.” “Such an"|FALSE
39064|"ethical life is absolute truth, for untruth is only in the fixture of a"|FALSE
39064|"single mode: but in the everlasting being of the nation all singleness is"|FALSE
39064|"superseded. It is absolute culture; for in the eternal is the real and"|FALSE
39064|"empirical annihilation and prescription of all limited modality. It is"|FALSE
39064|"absolute disinterestedness: for in the eternal there is nothing private"|FALSE
39064|"and personal. It, and each of its movements, is the highest beauty: for"|FALSE
39064|"beauty is but the eternal made actual and given concrete shape. It is"|FALSE
39064|"without pain, and blessed: for in it all difference and all pain is"|FALSE
39064|"superseded. It is the divine, absolute, real, existing and being, under no"|FALSE
39064|"veil; nor need one first raise it up into the ideality of divinity, and"|FALSE
39064|"extract it from the appearance and empirical intuition; but it is, and"|FALSE
39064|"immediately, absolute intuition(111).”"|FALSE
39064|"If we compare this language with the statement of the Encyclopaedia we can"|FALSE
39064|"see how for the moment Hegel’s eye is engrossed with the glory of the"|FALSE
39064|"ideal nation. In it, the moral life embraces and is co-extensive with"|FALSE
39064|"religion, art and science: practice and theory are at one: life in the"|FALSE
39064|"idea knows none of those differences which, in the un-ideal world, make"|FALSE
39064|"art and morality often antithetical, and set religion at variance with"|FALSE
39064|"science. It is, as we have said, a memory of Greek and perhaps Hebrew"|FALSE
39064|"ideals. Or rather it is by the help of such memories the affirmation of"|FALSE
39064|"the essential unity of life—the true, complete, many-sided life—which is"|FALSE
39064|"the presupposition and idea that culture and morals rest upon and from"|FALSE
39064|"which they get their supreme sanction, i.e. their constitutive principle"|FALSE
39064|"and unity. Even in the Encyclopaedia(112) Hegel endeavours to guard"|FALSE
39064|"against the severance of morality and art and philosophy which may be"|FALSE
39064|"rashly inferred in consequence of his serial order of treatment."|FALSE
39064|"“Religion,” he remarks, “is the very substance of the moral life itself"|FALSE
39064|"and of the state.... The ethical life is the divine spirit indwelling in"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness, as it is actually present in a nation and its individual"|FALSE
39064|"members.” Yet, as we see, there is a distinction. The process of history"|FALSE
39064|"carries out a judgment on nation after nation, and reveals the divine as"|FALSE
39064|"not only immanent in the ethical life but as ever expanding the limited"|FALSE
39064|"national spirit till it become a spirit of universal humanity. Still—and"|FALSE
39064|"this is perhaps for each time always the more important—the national"|FALSE
39064|"unity—not indeed as a multitude, nor as a majority—is the supreme real"|FALSE
39064|"appearance of the Eternal and Absolute."|FALSE
39064|"Having thus described the nation as an organic totality, he goes on to"|FALSE
39064|"point out that the political constitution shows this character by forming"|FALSE
39064|"a triplicity of political orders. In one of these there is but a silent,"|FALSE
39064|"practical identity, in faith and trust, with the totality: in the second"|FALSE
39064|"there is a thorough disruption of interest into particularity: and in the"|FALSE
39064|"third, there is a living and intellectual identity or indifference, which"|FALSE
39064|"combines the widest range of individual development with the completest"|FALSE
39064|"unity of political loyalty. This last order is that which lives in"|FALSE
39064|"conscious identification of private with public duty: all that it does has"|FALSE
39064|"a universal and public function. Such a body is the ideal Nobility—the"|FALSE
39064|"nobility which is the _servus servorum Dei_, the supreme servant of"|FALSE
39064|"humanity. Its function is to maintain general interests, to give the other"|FALSE
39064|"orders (peasantry and industrials) security,—receiving in return from"|FALSE
39064|"these others the means of subsistence. _Noblesse oblige_ gives the"|FALSE
39064|"death-blow to particular interests, and imposes the duty of exhibiting, in"|FALSE
39064|"the clearest form, the supreme reality of absolute morality, and of being"|FALSE
39064|"to the rest an unperturbed ideal of aesthetic, ethical, religious, and"|FALSE
39064|"philosophical completeness."|FALSE
39064|"It is here alone, in this estate which is absolutely disinterested, that"|FALSE
39064|"the virtues appear in their true light. To the ordinary moralising"|FALSE
39064|"standpoint they seem severally to be, in their separation, charged with"|FALSE
39064|"independent value. But from the higher point of view the existence, and"|FALSE
39064|"still more the accentuation of single virtues, is a mark of"|FALSE
39064|"incompleteness. Even quality, it has been said, involves its defects: it"|FALSE
39064|"can only shine by eclipsing or reflecting something else. The completely"|FALSE
39064|"moral is not the sum of the several virtues, but the reduction of them to"|FALSE
39064|"indifference. It is thus that when Plato tries to get at the unity of"|FALSE
39064|"virtue, their aspect of difference tends to be subordinated. “The movement"|FALSE
39064|"of absolute morality runs through all the virtues, but settles fixedly in"|FALSE
39064|"none.” It is more than love _to_ fatherland, and nation, and laws:—that"|FALSE
39064|"still implies a relation to something and involves a difference. For"|FALSE
39064|"love—the mortal passion, where “self is not annulled”—is the process of"|FALSE
39064|"approximation, while unity is not yet attained, but wished and aimed at:"|FALSE
39064|"and when it is complete—and become “such love as spirits know(113)”—it"|FALSE
39064|"gives place to a calmer rest and an active immanence. The absolute"|FALSE
39064|"morality is _life in_ the fatherland and for the nation. In the individual"|FALSE
39064|"however it is the process upward and inward that we see, not the"|FALSE
39064|"consummation. Then the identity appears as an ideal, as a tendency not yet"|FALSE
39064|"accomplished to its end, a possibility not yet made fully actual. At"|FALSE
39064|"bottom—in the divine substance in which the individual inheres—the"|FALSE
39064|"identity is present: but in the appearance, we have only the passage from"|FALSE
39064|"possible to actual, a passage which has the aspect of a struggle. Hence"|FALSE
39064|"the moral act appears as a virtue, with merit or desert. It is accordingly"|FALSE
39064|"the very characteristic of virtue to signalise its own incompleteness: it"|FALSE
39064|"emerges into actuality only through antagonism, and with a taint of"|FALSE
39064|"imperfection clinging to it. Thus, in the field of absolute morality, if"|FALSE
39064|"the virtues appear, it is only in their transiency. If they were"|FALSE
39064|"undisputedly real in morality, they would not separately show. To feel"|FALSE
39064|"that you have done well implies that you have not done wholly well:"|FALSE
39064|"self-gratulation in meritorious deed is the re-action from the shudder at"|FALSE
39064|"feeling that the self was not wholly good."|FALSE
39064|"The essential unity of virtue—its negative character as regards all the"|FALSE
39064|"empirical variety of virtues—is seen in the excellences required by the"|FALSE
39064|"needs of war. These military requirements demonstrate the mere relativity"|FALSE
39064|"and therefore non-virtuousness of the special virtues. They equally"|FALSE
39064|"protest against the common beliefs in the supreme dignity of labour and"|FALSE
39064|"its utilities. But if bravery or soldierlike virtue be essentially a"|FALSE
39064|"virtue of virtues, it is only a negative virtue after all. It is the blast"|FALSE
39064|"of the universal sweeping away all the habitations and fixed structures of"|FALSE
39064|"particularist life. If it is a unity of virtue, it is only a negative"|FALSE
39064|"unity—an indifference. If it avoid the parcelling of virtue into a number"|FALSE
39064|"of imperfect and sometimes contradictory parts, it does so only to present"|FALSE
39064|"a bare negation. The soldier, therefore, if in potentiality the unity of"|FALSE
39064|"all the virtues, may tend in practice to represent the ability to do"|FALSE
39064|"without any of them(114)."|FALSE
39064|"The home of these “relative” virtues—of morality in the ordinary sense—is"|FALSE
39064|"the life of the second order in the commonwealth: the order of industry"|FALSE
39064|"and commerce. In this sphere the idea of the universal is gradually lost"|FALSE
39064|"to view: it becomes, says Hegel, only a thought or a creature of the mind,"|FALSE
39064|"which does not affect practice. The materialistic worker of civilisation"|FALSE
39064|"does not see further than the empirical existence of individuals: his"|FALSE
39064|"horizon is limited by the family, and his final ideal is a competency of"|FALSE
39064|"comfort in possessions and revenues. The supreme universal to which he"|FALSE
39064|"attains as the climax of his evolution is only money. But it is only with"|FALSE
39064|"the vaster development of commerce that this terrible consequence ensues."|FALSE
39064|"At first as a mere individual, he has higher aims, though not the highest."|FALSE
39064|"He has a limited ideal determined by his special sphere of work. To win"|FALSE
39064|"respect—the character for a limited truthfulness and honesty and skilful"|FALSE
39064|"work—is his ambition. He lives in a conceit of his performance—his"|FALSE
39064|"utility—the esteem of his special circle. To his commercial soul the"|FALSE

39064|"Of the peasant order Hegel has less to say. On one side the “country” as"|FALSE

39064|"Of the purely political function of the state Hegel in this sketch says"|FALSE
39064|"almost nothing. But under the head of the general government of the state"|FALSE
39064|"he deals with its social functions. For a moment he refers to the"|FALSE
39064|"well-known distinction of the legislative, judicial and executive powers."|FALSE
39064|"But it is only to remark that “in every governmental act all three are"|FALSE

39064|"Legislation, judicature, and executive are something completely formal,"|FALSE
39064|"empty, and contentless.... Whether the others are or are not bare"|FALSE
39064|"abstractions, empty activities, depends entirely on the executive power;"|FALSE
39064|"and this is absolutely the government(116).” Treating government as the"|FALSE
39064|"organic movement by which the universal and the particular in the"|FALSE
39064|"commonwealth come into relations, he finds that it presents three forms,"|FALSE
39064|"or gives rise to three systems. The highest and last of these is the"|FALSE
39064|"“educational” system. By this he understands all that activity by which"|FALSE
39064|"the intelligence of the state tries directly to mould and guide the"|FALSE
39064|"character and fortunes of its members: all the means of culture and"|FALSE
39064|"discipline, whether in general or for individuals, all training to public"|FALSE
39064|"function, to truthfulness, to good manners. Under the same head come"|FALSE
39064|"conquest and colonisation as state agencies. The second system is the"|FALSE
39064|"judicial, which instead of, like the former, aiming at the formation or"|FALSE
39064|"reformation of its members is satisfied by subjecting individual"|FALSE
39064|"transgression to a process of rectification by the general principle. With"|FALSE
39064|"regard to the system of judicature, Hegel argues for a variety of"|FALSE
39064|"procedure to suit different ranks, and for a corresponding modification of"|FALSE
39064|"penalties. “Formal rigid equality is just what does not spare the"|FALSE

39064|"In the first of the three systems, the economic system, or “System of"|FALSE

39064|"there is substituted for the dependence of the individual on the general"|FALSE
39064|"resultant of a vast number of agencies a dependence on one enormously rich"|FALSE
39064|"individual, who can control the physical destinies of a nation. But a"|FALSE
39064|"nation, truly speaking, is there no more. The industrial order has parted"|FALSE
39064|"into a mere abstract workman on one hand, and the _grande richesse_ on the"|FALSE

39064|"commandment, _Know thyself_—whether we look at it in itself or under the"|FALSE

39064|"self-knowledge in respect of the _particular_ capacities, character,"|FALSE

39064|"means that of man’s genuine reality—of what is essentially and ultimately"|FALSE
39064|"true and real—of mind as the true and essential being. Equally little is"|FALSE
39064|"it the purport of mental philosophy to teach what is called _knowledge of"|FALSE
39064|"men_—the knowledge whose aim is to detect the _peculiarities_, passions,"|FALSE
39064|"and foibles of other men, and lay bare what are called the recesses of the"|FALSE

39064|"unless on the assumption that we know the _universal_—man as man, and,"|FALSE
39064|"that always must be, as mind. And for another, being only engaged with"|FALSE
39064|"casual, insignificant and _untrue_ aspects of mental life, it fails to"|FALSE
39064|"reach the underlying essence of them all—the mind itself."|FALSE
39064|"§ 378. Pneumatology, or, as it was also called, Rational Psychology, has"|FALSE
39064|"been already alluded to in the Introduction to the Logic as an _abstract_"|FALSE
39064|"and generalising metaphysic of the subject. _Empirical_ (or inductive)"|FALSE
39064|"psychology, on the other hand, deals with the “concrete” mind: and, after"|FALSE
39064|"the revival of the sciences, when observation and experience had been made"|FALSE
39064|"the distinctive methods for the study of concrete reality, such psychology"|FALSE
39064|"was worked on the same lines as other sciences. In this way it came about"|FALSE
39064|"that the metaphysical theory was kept outside the inductive science, and"|FALSE
39064|"so prevented from getting any concrete embodiment or detail: whilst at the"|FALSE
39064|"same time the inductive science clung to the conventional common-sense"|FALSE
39064|"metaphysic, with its analysis into forces, various activities, &c., and"|FALSE
39064|"rejected any attempt at a “speculative” treatment."|FALSE
39064|"The books of Aristotle on the Soul, along with his discussions on its"|FALSE
39064|"special aspects and states, are for this reason still by far the most"|FALSE
39064|"admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this"|FALSE
39064|"topic. The main aim of a philosophy of mind can only be to re-introduce"|FALSE
39064|"unity of idea and principle into the theory of mind, and so re-interpret"|FALSE
39064|"the lesson of those Aristotelian books."|FALSE
39064|"§ 379. Even our own sense of the mind’s _living_ unity naturally protests"|FALSE
39064|"against any attempt to break it up into different faculties, forces, or,"|FALSE
39064|"what comes to the same thing, activities, conceived as independent of each"|FALSE
39064|"other. But the craving for a _comprehension_ of the unity is still further"|FALSE
39064|"stimulated, as we soon come across distinctions between mental freedom and"|FALSE
39064|"mental determinism, antitheses between free _psychic_ agency and the"|FALSE
39064|"corporeity that lies external to it, whilst we equally note the intimate"|FALSE
39064|"interdependence of the one upon the other. In modern times especially the"|FALSE
39064|"phenomena of _animal magnetism_ have given, even in experience, a lively"|FALSE
39064|"and visible confirmation of the underlying unity of soul, and of the power"|FALSE
39064|"of its “ideality.” Before these facts, the rigid distinctions of practical"|FALSE
39064|"common sense were struck with confusion; and the necessity of a"|FALSE
39064|"“speculative” examination with a view to the removal of difficulties was"|FALSE
39064|"more directly forced upon the student."|FALSE
39064|"§ 380. The “concrete” nature of mind involves for the observer the"|FALSE
39064|"peculiar difficulty that the several grades and special types which"|FALSE
39064|"develop its intelligible unity in detail are not left standing as so many"|FALSE
39064|"separate existences confronting its more advanced aspects. It is otherwise"|FALSE
39064|"in external nature. There, matter and movement, for example, have a"|FALSE
39064|"manifestation all their own—it is the solar system; and similarly the"|FALSE
39064|"_differentiae_ of sense-perception have a sort of earlier existence in the"|FALSE

39064|"The species and grades of mental evolution, on the contrary, lose their"|FALSE
39064|"separate existence and become factors, states and features in the higher"|FALSE
39064|"grades of development. As a consequence of this, a lower and more abstract"|FALSE
39064|"aspect of mind betrays the presence in it, even to experience, of a higher"|FALSE
39064|"grade. Under the guise of sensation, e.g., we may find the very highest"|FALSE
39064|"mental life as its modification or its embodiment. And so sensation, which"|FALSE
39064|"is but a mere form and vehicle, may to the superficial glance seem to be"|FALSE
39064|"the proper seat and, as it were, the source of those moral and religious"|FALSE
39064|"principles with which it is charged; and the moral and religious"|FALSE
39064|"principles thus modified may seem to call for treatment as species of"|FALSE
39064|"sensation. But at the same time, when lower grades of mental life are"|FALSE
39064|"under examination, it becomes necessary, if we desire to point to actual"|FALSE
39064|"cases of them in experience, to direct attention to more advanced grades"|FALSE
39064|"for which they are mere forms. In this way subjects will be treated of by"|FALSE
39064|"anticipation which properly belong to later stages of development (e.g. in"|FALSE
39064|"dealing with natural awaking from sleep we speak by anticipation of"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness, or in dealing with mental derangement we must speak of"|FALSE
39064|"intellect)."|FALSE

39064|"§ 381. From our point of view Mind has for its _presupposition_ Nature, of"|FALSE
39064|"which it is the truth, and for that reason its _absolute prius_. In this"|FALSE
39064|"its truth Nature is vanished, and mind has resulted as the “Idea” entered"|FALSE
39064|"on possession of itself. Here the subject and object of the Idea are"|FALSE
39064|"one—either is the intelligent unity, the notion. This identity is"|FALSE
39064|"_absolute negativity_—for whereas in Nature the intelligent unity has its"|FALSE
39064|"objectivity perfect but externalised, this self-externalisation has been"|FALSE
39064|"nullified and the unity in that way been made one and the same with"|FALSE
39064|"itself. Thus at the same time it is this identity only so far as it is a"|FALSE
39064|"return out of nature."|FALSE
39064|"§ 382. For this reason the essential, but formally essential, feature of"|FALSE
39064|"mind is Liberty: i.e. it is the notion’s absolute negativity or"|FALSE
39064|"self-identity. Considered as this formal aspect, it _may_ withdraw itself"|FALSE
39064|"from everything external and from its own externality, its very existence;"|FALSE
39064|"it can thus submit to infinite _pain_, the negation of its individual"|FALSE
39064|"immediacy: in other words, it can keep itself affirmative in this"|FALSE
39064|"negativity and possess its own identity. All this is possible so long as"|FALSE
39064|"it is considered in its abstract self-contained universality."|FALSE
39064|"§ 383. This universality is also its determinate sphere of being. Having a"|FALSE
39064|"being of its own, the universal is self-particularising, whilst it still"|FALSE
39064|"remains self-identical. Hence the special mode of mental being is"|FALSE
39064|"“_manifestation_.” The spirit is not some one mode or meaning which finds"|FALSE
39064|"utterance or externality only in a form distinct from itself: it does not"|FALSE
39064|"manifest or reveal _something_, but its very mode and meaning is this"|FALSE
39064|"revelation. And thus in its mere possibility Mind is at the same moment an"|FALSE
39064|"infinite, “absolute,” _actuality_."|FALSE
39064|"§ 384. _Revelation_, taken to mean the revelation of the _abstract_ Idea,"|FALSE
39064|"is an unmediated transition to Nature which _comes_ to be. As Mind is"|FALSE
39064|"free, its manifestation is to _set forth_ Nature as _its_ world; but"|FALSE
39064|"because it is reflection, it, in thus setting forth its world, at the same"|FALSE
39064|"time _presupposes_ the world as a nature independently existing. In the"|FALSE
39064|"intellectual sphere to reveal is thus to create a world as its being—a"|FALSE

39064|"freedom."|FALSE
39064|"_The Absolute is Mind_ (Spirit)—this is the supreme definition of the"|FALSE
39064|"Absolute. To find this definition and to grasp its meaning and burthen"|FALSE
39064|"was, we may say, the ultimate purpose of all education and all philosophy:"|FALSE
39064|"it was the point to which turned the impulse of all religion and science:"|FALSE

39064|"remains for philosophy in its own element of intelligible unity to get"|FALSE
39064|"hold of what was thus given as a mental image, and what implicitly is the"|FALSE

39064|"§ 386. The two first parts of the doctrine of Mind embrace the finite"|FALSE

39064|"representations. Thus superficially classified as states of mental"|FALSE

39064|"nothing more than mental idea. But the concrete theory of the waking soul"|FALSE
39064|"in its realised being views it as _consciousness_ and _intellect_: and the"|FALSE
39064|"world of intelligent consciousness is something quite different from a"|FALSE
39064|"picture of mere ideas and images. The latter are in the main only"|FALSE
39064|"externally conjoined, in an unintelligent way, by the laws of the"|FALSE
39064|"so-called _Association of Ideas_; though here and there of course logical"|FALSE
39064|"principles may also be operative. But in the waking state man behaves"|FALSE
39064|"essentially as a concrete ego, an intelligence: and because of this"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence his sense-perception stands before him as a concrete totality"|FALSE
39064|"of features in which each member, each point, takes up its place as at the"|FALSE
39064|"same time determined through and with all the rest. Thus the facts"|FALSE
39064|"embodied in his sensation are authenticated, not by his mere subjective"|FALSE
39064|"representation and distinction of the facts as something external from the"|FALSE
39064|"person, but by virtue of the concrete interconnexion in which each part"|FALSE
39064|"stands with all parts of this complex. The waking state is the concrete"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness of this mutual corroboration of each single factor of its"|FALSE
39064|"content by all the others in the picture as perceived. The consciousness"|FALSE
39064|"of this interdependence need not be explicit and distinct. Still this"|FALSE
39064|"general setting to all sensations is implicitly present in the concrete"|FALSE

39064|"that no testimony can avail against them, and they have even denied what"|FALSE
39064|"they had seen with their own eyes. In order to believe in this department"|FALSE
39064|"even what one sees with these eyes, and still more to understand it, the"|FALSE
39064|"first requisite is not to be in bondage to the hard and fast categories of"|FALSE
39064|"the practical intellect. The chief points on which the discussion turns"|FALSE
39064|"may here be given:"|FALSE
39064|"(α) To the _concrete_ existence of the individual belongs the aggregate of"|FALSE
39064|"his fundamental _interests_, both the essential and the particular"|FALSE
39064|"empirical ties which connect him with other men and the world at large."|FALSE
39064|"This totality forms _his_ actuality, in the sense that it lies in fact"|FALSE
39064|"immanent in him; it has already been called his _genius_. This genius is"|FALSE
39064|"not the free mind which wills and thinks: the form of sensitivity, in"|FALSE
39064|"which the individual here appears immersed, is, on the contrary, a"|FALSE
39064|"surrender of his self-possessed intelligent existence. The first"|FALSE
39064|"conclusion to which these considerations lead, with reference to the"|FALSE
39064|"contents of consciousness in the somnambulist stage, is that it is only"|FALSE
39064|"the range of his individually moulded world (of his private interests and"|FALSE
39064|"narrow relationships) which appear there. Scientific theories and"|FALSE
39064|"philosophic conceptions or general truths require a different"|FALSE
39064|"soil,—require an intelligence which has risen out of the inarticulate mass"|FALSE
39064|"of mere sensitivity to free consciousness. It is foolish therefore to"|FALSE
39064|"expect revelations about the higher ideas from the somnambulist state."|FALSE
39064|"(β) Where a human being’s senses and intellect are sound, he is fully and"|FALSE
39064|"intelligently alive to that reality of his which gives concrete filling to"|FALSE
39064|"his individuality: but he is awake to it in the form of interconnexion"|FALSE
39064|"between himself and the features of that reality conceived as an external"|FALSE
39064|"and a separate world, and he is aware that this world is in itself also a"|FALSE
39064|"complex of interconnexions of a practically intelligible kind. In his"|FALSE
39064|"subjective ideas and plans he has also before him this causally connected"|FALSE
39064|"scheme of things he calls his world and the series of means which bring"|FALSE
39064|"his ideas and his purposes into adjustment with the objective existences,"|FALSE
39064|"which are also means and ends to each other. At the same time, this world"|FALSE
39064|"which is outside him has its threads in him to such a degree that it is"|FALSE
39064|"these threads which make him what he really is: he too would become"|FALSE
39064|"extinct if these externalities were to disappear, unless by the aid of"|FALSE
39064|"religion, subjective reason, and character, he is in a remarkable degree"|FALSE
39064|"self-supporting and independent of them. But, then, in the latter case he"|FALSE
39064|"is less susceptible of the psychical state here spoken of.—As an"|FALSE
39064|"illustration of that identity with the surroundings may be noted the"|FALSE
39064|"effect produced by the death of beloved relatives, friends, &c. on those"|FALSE
39064|"left behind, so that the one dies or pines away with the loss of the"|FALSE
39064|"other. (Thus Cato, after the downfall of the Roman republic, could live no"|FALSE
39064|"longer: his inner reality was neither wider than higher than it.) Compare"|FALSE
39064|"home-sickness, and the like."|FALSE
39064|"(γ) But when all that occupies the waking consciousness, the world outside"|FALSE
39064|"it and its relationship to that world is under a veil, and the soul is"|FALSE
39064|"thus sunk in sleep (in magnetic sleep, in catalepsy, and other diseases,"|FALSE
39064|"e.g. those connected with female development, or at the approach of death,"|FALSE
39064|"&c.), then that _immanent actuality_ of the individual remains the same"|FALSE
39064|"substantial total as before, but now as a purely sensitive life with an"|FALSE
39064|"inward vision and an inward consciousness. And because it is the adult,"|FALSE
39064|"formed, and developed consciousness which is degraded into this state of"|FALSE
39064|"sensitivity, it retains along with its content a certain nominal"|FALSE
39064|"self-hood, a formal vision and awareness, which however does not go so far"|FALSE
39064|"as the conscious judgment or discernment by which its contents, when it is"|FALSE
39064|"healthy and awake, exist for it as an outward objectivity. The individual"|FALSE
39064|"is thus a monad which is inwardly aware of its actuality—a genius which"|FALSE
39064|"beholds itself. The characteristic point in such knowledge is that the"|FALSE
39064|"very same facts (which for the healthy consciousness are an objective"|FALSE
39064|"practical reality, and to know which, in its sober moods, it needs the"|FALSE
39064|"intelligent chain of means and conditions in all their real expansion) are"|FALSE
39064|"now immediately known and perceived in this immanence. This perception is"|FALSE
39064|"a sort of _clairvoyance_; for it is a consciousness living in the"|FALSE
39064|"undivided substantiality of the genius, and finding itself in the very"|FALSE
39064|"heart of the interconnexion, and so can dispense with the series of"|FALSE
39064|"conditions, external one to another, which lead up to the"|FALSE
39064|"result,—conditions which cool reflection has in succession to traverse and"|FALSE
39064|"in so doing feels the limits of its own individual externality. But such"|FALSE
39064|"clairvoyance—just because its dim and turbid vision does not present the"|FALSE
39064|"facts in a rational interconnexion—is for that very reason at the mercy of"|FALSE
39064|"every private contingency of feeling and fancy, &c.—not to mention that"|FALSE
39064|"foreign _suggestions_ (see later) intrude into its vision. It is thus"|FALSE
39064|"impossible to make out whether what the clairvoyants really see"|FALSE
39064|"preponderates over what they deceive themselves in.—But it is absurd to"|FALSE
39064|"treat this visionary state as a sublime mental phase and as a truer state,"|FALSE
39064|"capable of conveying general truths(123)."|FALSE
39064|"(δ) An essential feature of this sensitivity, with its absence of"|FALSE
39064|"intelligent and volitional personality, is this, that it is a state of"|FALSE
39064|"passivity, like that of the child in the womb. The patient in this"|FALSE
39064|"condition is accordingly made, and continues to be, subject to the power"|FALSE
39064|"of another person, the magnetiser; so that when the two are thus in"|FALSE
39064|"psychical _rapport_, the selfless individual, not really a “person,” has"|FALSE
39064|"for his subjective consciousness the consciousness of the other. This"|FALSE
39064|"latter self-possessed individual is thus the effective subjective soul of"|FALSE
39064|"the former, and the genius which may even supply him with a train of"|FALSE
39064|"ideas. That the somnambulist perceives in himself tastes and smells which"|FALSE
39064|"are present in the person with whom he stands _en rapport_, and that he is"|FALSE
39064|"aware of the other inner ideas and present perceptions of the latter as if"|FALSE
39064|"they were his own, shows the substantial identity which the soul (which"|FALSE
39064|"even in its concreteness is also truly immaterial) is capable of holding"|FALSE
39064|"with another. When the substance of both is thus made one, there is only"|FALSE
39064|"one subjectivity of consciousness: the patient has a sort of"|FALSE
39064|"individuality, but it is empty, not on the spot, not actual: and this"|FALSE
39064|"nominal self accordingly derives its whole stock of ideas from the"|FALSE
39064|"sensations and ideas of the other, in whom it sees, smells, tastes, reads,"|FALSE
39064|"and hears. It is further to be noted on this point that the somnambulist"|FALSE
39064|"is thus brought into _rapport_ with two genii and a twofold set of ideas,"|FALSE
39064|"his own and that of the magnetiser. But it is impossible to say precisely"|FALSE
39064|"which sensations and which visions he, in this nominal perception,"|FALSE
39064|"receives, beholds and brings to knowledge from his own inward self, and"|FALSE
39064|"which from the suggestions of the person with whom he stands in relation."|FALSE
39064|"This uncertainty may be the source of many deceptions, and accounts among"|FALSE
39064|"other things for the diversity that inevitably shows itself among"|FALSE
39064|"somnambulists from different countries and under _rapport_ with persons of"|FALSE
39064|"different education, as regards their views on morbid states and the"|FALSE
39064|"methods of cure, or medicines for them, as well as on scientific and"|FALSE
39064|"intellectual topics."|FALSE

39064|"varieties of sensation have disappeared, and hence, when the activity of"|FALSE
39064|"the sense-organs is asleep, the “common sense,” or “general feeling”"|FALSE
39064|"specifies itself to several functions; one sees and hears with the"|FALSE
39064|"fingers, and especially with the pit of the stomach, &c."|FALSE
39064|"To comprehend a thing means in the language of practical intelligence to"|FALSE

39064|"ordinary course of nature, in compliance with the laws and relations of"|FALSE
39064|"the intellect, e.g. causality, reasons, &c. The purely sensitive life, on"|FALSE

39064|"the morbid state alluded to, is just this form of immediacy, without any"|FALSE
39064|"distinctions between subjective and objective, between intelligent"|FALSE

39064|"impossible, so long as we assume independent personalities, independent"|FALSE

39064|"psychical life keeps its own abstract independence in it, and the"|FALSE
39064|"self-feeling as such, consciousness, reflection, and any other purposes"|FALSE
39064|"and activity, are no longer bothered with it. (β) There is indifference"|FALSE
39064|"towards the satisfaction: the desires and impulses are by the _habit_ of"|FALSE
39064|"their satisfaction deadened. This is the rational liberation from them;"|FALSE
39064|"whereas monastic renunciation and forcible interference do not free from"|FALSE
39064|"them, nor are they in conception rational. Of course in all this it is"|FALSE
39064|"assumed that the impulses are kept as the finite modes they naturally are,"|FALSE
39064|"and that they, like their satisfaction, are subordinated as partial"|FALSE
39064|"factors to the reasonable will. (γ) In habit regarded as _aptitude_, or"|FALSE
39064|"skill, not merely has the abstract psychical life to be kept intact _per"|FALSE
39064|"se_, but it has to be imposed as a subjective aim, to be made a power in"|FALSE
39064|"the bodily part, which is rendered subject and thoroughly pervious to it."|FALSE
39064|"Conceived as having the inward purpose of the subjective soul thus imposed"|FALSE
39064|"upon it, the body is treated as an immediate externality and a barrier."|FALSE
39064|"Thus comes out the more decided rupture between the soul as simple"|FALSE
39064|"self-concentration, and its earlier naturalness and immediacy; it has lost"|FALSE
39064|"its original and immediate identity with the bodily nature, and as"|FALSE
39064|"external has first to be reduced to that position. Specific feelings can"|FALSE
39064|"only get bodily shape in a perfectly specific way (§ 401); and the"|FALSE
39064|"immediate portion of body is a particular possibility for a specific aim"|FALSE
39064|"(a particular aspect of its differentiated structure, a particular organ"|FALSE
39064|"of its organic system). To mould such an aim in the organic body is to"|FALSE
39064|"bring out and express the “ideality” which is implicit in matter always,"|FALSE
39064|"and especially so in the specific bodily part, and thus to enable the"|FALSE
39064|"soul, under its volitional and conceptual characters, to exist as"|FALSE

39064|"most external of them, i.e. the spatial direction of an individual, viz."|FALSE
39064|"his upright posture, has been by will made a habit—a position taken"|FALSE
39064|"without adjustment and without consciousness—which continues to be an"|FALSE
39064|"affair of his persistent will; for the man stands only because and in so"|FALSE
39064|"far as he wills to stand, and only so long as he wills it without"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness. Similarly our eyesight is the concrete habit which, without"|FALSE
39064|"an express adjustment, combines in a single act the several modifications"|FALSE

39064|"up. Thinking, too, however free and active in its own pure element it"|FALSE
39064|"becomes, no less requires habit and familiarity (this impromptuity or form"|FALSE
39064|"of immediacy), by which it is the property of my single self where I can"|FALSE
39064|"freely and in all directions range. It is through this habit that I come"|FALSE
39064|"to realise my _existence_ as a thinking being. Even here, in this"|FALSE
39064|"spontaneity of self-centred thought, there is a partnership of soul and"|FALSE
39064|"body (hence, want of habit and too-long-continued thinking cause"|FALSE

39064|"brings on death, or, if quite abstract, is death itself: and yet habit is"|FALSE

39064|"such. Intelligence is the power which wields the stores of images and"|FALSE
39064|"ideas belonging to it, and which thus (2) freely combines and subsumes"|FALSE
39064|"these stores in obedience to its peculiar tenor. Such is creative"|FALSE
39064|"imagination(140)—symbolic, allegoric, or poetical imagination—where the"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence gets a definite embodiment in this store of ideas and informs"|FALSE
39064|"them with its general tone. These more or less concrete, individualised"|FALSE
39064|"creations are still “syntheses”: for the material, in which the subjective"|FALSE
39064|"principles and ideas get a mentally pictorial existence, is derived from"|FALSE
39064|"the data of intuition."|FALSE
39064|"§ 457. In creative imagination intelligence has been so far perfected as"|FALSE
39064|"to need no helps for intuition. Its self-sprung ideas have pictorial"|FALSE
39064|"existence. This pictorial creation of its intuitive spontaneity is"|FALSE
39064|"subjective—still lacks the side of existence. But as the creation unites"|FALSE
39064|"the internal idea with the vehicle of materialisation, intelligence has"|FALSE
39064|"therein _implicitly_ returned both to identical self-relation and to"|FALSE
39064|"immediacy. As reason, its first start was to appropriate the immediate"|FALSE
39064|"datum in itself (§§ 445, 455), i.e. to universalise it; and now its action"|FALSE
39064|"as reason (§ 458) is from the present point directed towards giving the"|FALSE
39064|"character of an existent to what in it has been perfected to concrete"|FALSE
39064|"auto-intuition. In other words, it aims at making itself _be_ and be a"|FALSE
39064|"fact. Acting on this view, it is self-uttering, intuition-producing: the"|FALSE
39064|"imagination which creates signs."|FALSE
39064|"Productive imagination is the centre in which the universal and being,"|FALSE
39064|"one’s own and what is picked up, internal and external, are completely"|FALSE
39064|"welded into one. The preceding “syntheses” of intuition, recollection,"|FALSE
39064|"&c., are unifications of the same factors, but they are “syntheses”; it is"|FALSE
39064|"not till creative imagination that intelligence ceases to be the vague"|FALSE
39064|"mine and the universal, and becomes an individuality, a concrete"|FALSE
39064|"subjectivity, in which the self-reference is defined both to being and to"|FALSE
39064|"universality. The creations of imagination are on all hands recognised as"|FALSE
39064|"such combinations of the mind’s own and inward with the matter of"|FALSE
39064|"intuition; what further and more definite aspects they have is a matter"|FALSE
39064|"for other departments. For the present this internal studio of"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence is only to be looked at in these abstract"|FALSE
39064|"aspects.—Imagination, when regarded as the agency of this unification, is"|FALSE
39064|"reason, but only a nominal reason, because the matter or theme it embodies"|FALSE
39064|"is to imagination _quâ_ imagination a matter of indifference; whilst"|FALSE
39064|"reason _quâ_ reason also insists upon the _truth_ of its content."|FALSE
39064|"Another point calling for special notice is that, when imagination"|FALSE
39064|"elevates the internal meaning to an image and intuition, and this is"|FALSE
39064|"expressed by saying that it gives the former the character of an"|FALSE
39064|"_existent_, the phrase must not seem surprising that intelligence makes"|FALSE
39064|"itself _be_ as a _thing_; for its ideal import is itself, and so is the"|FALSE
39064|"aspect which it imposes upon it. The image produced by imagination of an"|FALSE
39064|"object is a bare mental or subjective intuition: in the sign or symbol it"|FALSE
39064|"adds intuitability proper; and in mechanical memory it completes, so far"|FALSE
39064|"as it is concerned, this form of _being_."|FALSE
39064|"§ 458. In this unity (initiated by intelligence) of an independent"|FALSE
39064|"representation with an intuition, the matter of the latter is, in the"|FALSE
39064|"first instance, something accepted, somewhat immediate or given (e.g. the"|FALSE
39064|"colour of the cockade, &c.). But in the fusion of the two elements, the"|FALSE
39064|"intuition does not count positively or as representing itself, but as"|FALSE
39064|"representative of something else. It is an image, which has received as"|FALSE
39064|"its soul and meaning an independent mental representation. This intuition"|FALSE
39064|"is the _Sign_."|FALSE
39064|"The sign is some immediate intuition, representing a totally different"|FALSE
39064|"import from what naturally belongs to it; it is the pyramid into which a"|FALSE
39064|"foreign soul has been conveyed, and where it is conserved. The _sign_ is"|FALSE
39064|"different from the _symbol_: for in the symbol the original characters (in"|FALSE
39064|"essence and conception) of the visible object are more or less identical"|FALSE
39064|"with the import which it bears as symbol; whereas in the sign, strictly"|FALSE
39064|"so-called, the natural attributes of the intuition, and the connotation of"|FALSE
39064|"which it is a sign, have nothing to do with each other. Intelligence"|FALSE
39064|"therefore gives proof of wider choice and ampler authority in the use of"|FALSE
39064|"intuitions when it treats them as designatory (significative) rather than"|FALSE
39064|"as symbolical."|FALSE
39064|"In logic and psychology, signs and language are usually foisted in"|FALSE
39064|"somewhere as an appendix, without any trouble being taken to display their"|FALSE
39064|"necessity and systematic place in the economy of intelligence. The right"|FALSE
39064|"place for the sign is that just given: where intelligence—which as"|FALSE
39064|"intuiting generates the form of time and space, but is apparently"|FALSE
39064|"recipient of sensible matter, out of which it forms ideas—now gives its"|FALSE
39064|"own original ideas a definite existence from itself, treating the"|FALSE
39064|"intuition (or time and space as filled full) as its own property, deleting"|FALSE
39064|"the connotation which properly and naturally belongs to it, and conferring"|FALSE
39064|"on it an other connotation as its soul and import. This sign-creating"|FALSE
39064|"activity may be distinctively named “productive” Memory (the primarily"|FALSE
39064|"abstract “Mnemosyne”); since memory, which in ordinary life is often used"|FALSE
39064|"as interchangeable and synonymous with remembrance (recollection), and"|FALSE
39064|"even with conception and imagination, has always to do with signs only."|FALSE
39064|"§ 459. The intuition—in its natural phase a something given and given in"|FALSE
39064|"space—acquires, when employed as a sign, the peculiar characteristic of"|FALSE
39064|"existing only as superseded and sublimated. Such is the negativity of"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence; and thus the truer phase of the intuition used as a sign is"|FALSE
39064|"existence in _time_ (but its existence vanishes in the moment of being),"|FALSE
39064|"and if we consider the rest of its external psychical quality, its"|FALSE
39064|"_institution_ by intelligence, but an institution growing out of its"|FALSE
39064|"(anthropological) own naturalness. This institution of the natural is the"|FALSE
39064|"vocal note, where the inward idea manifests itself in adequate utterance."|FALSE
39064|"The vocal note which receives further articulation to express specific"|FALSE
39064|"ideas—speech and, its system, language—gives to sensations, intuitions,"|FALSE

39064|"Language here comes under discussion only in the special aspect of a"|FALSE
39064|"product of intelligence for manifesting its ideas in an external medium."|FALSE
39064|"If language had to be treated in its concrete nature, it would be"|FALSE
39064|"necessary for its vocabulary or material part to recall the"|FALSE
39064|"anthropological or psycho-physiological point of view (§ 401), and for the"|FALSE
39064|"grammar or formal portion to anticipate the standpoint of analytic"|FALSE
39064|"understanding. With regard to the elementary _material_ of language, while"|FALSE
39064|"on one hand the theory of mere accident has disappeared, on the other the"|FALSE
39064|"principle of imitation has been restricted to the slight range it actually"|FALSE
39064|"covers—that of vocal objects. Yet one may still hear the German language"|FALSE
39064|"praised for its wealth—that wealth consisting in its special expression"|FALSE
39064|"for special sounds—_Rauschen_, _Sausen_, _Knarren_, &c.;—there have been"|FALSE
39064|"collected more than a hundred such words, perhaps: the humour of the"|FALSE

39064|"realm of sense and of triviality contributes nothing to form the real"|FALSE
39064|"wealth of a cultivated language. The strictly raw material of language"|FALSE
39064|"itself depends more upon an inward symbolism than a symbolism referring to"|FALSE
39064|"external objects; it depends, i.e. on anthropological articulation, as it"|FALSE
39064|"were the posture in the corporeal act of oral utterance. For each vowel"|FALSE
39064|"and consonant accordingly, as well as for their more abstract elements"|FALSE
39064|"(the posture of lips, palate, tongue in each) and for their combinations,"|FALSE
39064|"people have tried to find the appropriate signification. But these dull"|FALSE
39064|"sub-conscious beginnings are deprived of their original importance and"|FALSE
39064|"prominence by new influences, it may be by external agencies or by the"|FALSE
39064|"needs of civilisation. Having been originally sensuous intuitions, they"|FALSE
39064|"are reduced to signs, and thus have only traces left of their original"|FALSE
39064|"meaning, if it be not altogether extinguished. As to the _formal_ element,"|FALSE
39064|"again, it is the work of analytic intellect which informs language with"|FALSE
39064|"its categories: it is this logical instinct which gives rise to grammar."|FALSE
39064|"The study of languages still in their original state, which we have first"|FALSE
39064|"really begun to make acquaintance with in modern times, has shown on this"|FALSE
39064|"point that they contain a very elaborate grammar and express distinctions"|FALSE
39064|"which are lost or have been largely obliterated in the languages of more"|FALSE
39064|"civilised nations. It seems as if the language of the most civilised"|FALSE
39064|"nations has the most imperfect grammar, and that the same language has a"|FALSE
39064|"more perfect grammar when the nation is in a more uncivilised state than"|FALSE
39064|"when it reaches a higher civilisation. (Cf. W. von Humboldt’s _Essay on"|FALSE
39064|"the Dual_.)"|FALSE
39064|"In speaking of vocal (which is the original) language, we may touch, only"|FALSE
39064|"in passing, upon written language,—a further development in the particular"|FALSE
39064|"sphere of language which borrows the help of an externally practical"|FALSE
39064|"activity. It is from the province of immediate spatial intuition to which"|FALSE
39064|"written language proceeds that it takes and produces the signs (§ 454). In"|FALSE
39064|"particular, hieroglyphics uses spatial figures to designate _ideas_;"|FALSE
39064|"alphabetical writing, on the other hand, uses them to designate vocal"|FALSE
39064|"notes which are already signs. Alphabetical writing thus consists of signs"|FALSE
39064|"of signs,—the words or concrete signs of vocal language being analysed"|FALSE
39064|"into their simple elements, which severally receive"|FALSE
39064|"designation.—Leibnitz’s practical mind misled him to exaggerate the"|FALSE
39064|"advantages which a complete written language, formed on the hieroglyphic"|FALSE
39064|"method (and hieroglyphics are used even where there is alphabetic writing,"|FALSE
39064|"as in our signs for the numbers, the planets, the chemical elements, &c.),"|FALSE
39064|"would have as a universal language for the intercourse of nations and"|FALSE
39064|"especially of scholars. But we may be sure that it was rather the"|FALSE
39064|"intercourse of nations (as was probably the case in Phoenicia, and still"|FALSE
39064|"takes place in Canton—see _Macartney’s Travels_ by Staunton) which"|FALSE
39064|"occasioned the need of alphabetical writing and led to its formation. At"|FALSE
39064|"any rate a comprehensive hieroglyphic language for ever completed is"|FALSE
39064|"impracticable. Sensible objects no doubt admit of permanent signs; but, as"|FALSE
39064|"regards signs for mental objects, the progress of thought and the"|FALSE
39064|"continual development of logic lead to changes in the views of their"|FALSE
39064|"internal relations and thus also of their nature; and this would involve"|FALSE
39064|"the rise of a new hieroglyphical denotation. Even in the case of"|FALSE
39064|"sense-objects it happens that their names, i.e. their signs in vocal"|FALSE
39064|"language, are frequently changed, as e.g. in chemistry and mineralogy. Now"|FALSE
39064|"that it has been forgotten what names properly are, viz. externalities"|FALSE
39064|"which of themselves have no sense, and only get signification as signs,"|FALSE
39064|"and now that, instead of names proper, people ask for terms expressing a"|FALSE
39064|"sort of definition, which is frequently changed capriciously and"|FALSE
39064|"fortuitously, the denomination, i.e. the composite name formed of signs of"|FALSE
39064|"their generic characters or other supposed characteristic properties, is"|FALSE
39064|"altered in accordance with the differences of view with regard to the"|FALSE
39064|"genus or other supposed specific property. It is only a stationary"|FALSE
39064|"civilisation, like the Chinese, which admits of the hieroglyphic language"|FALSE
39064|"of that nation; and its method of writing moreover can only be the lot of"|FALSE
39064|"that small part of a nation which is in exclusive possession of mental"|FALSE
39064|"culture.—The progress of the vocal language depends most closely on the"|FALSE
39064|"habit of alphabetical writing; by means of which only does vocal language"|FALSE
39064|"acquire the precision and purity of its articulation. The imperfection of"|FALSE
39064|"the Chinese vocal language is notorious: numbers of its words possess"|FALSE
39064|"several utterly different meanings, as many as ten and twenty, so that, in"|FALSE
39064|"speaking, the distinction is made perceptible merely by accent and"|FALSE
39064|"intensity, by speaking low and soft or crying out. The European, learning"|FALSE
39064|"to speak Chinese, falls into the most ridiculous blunders before he has"|FALSE
39064|"mastered these absurd refinements of accentuation. Perfection here"|FALSE
39064|"consists in the opposite of that _parler sans accent_ which in Europe is"|FALSE
39064|"justly required of an educated speaker. The hieroglyphic mode of writing"|FALSE
39064|"keeps the Chinese vocal language from reaching that objective precision"|FALSE
39064|"which is gained in articulation by alphabetic writing."|FALSE
39064|"Alphabetic writing is on all accounts the more intelligent: in it the"|FALSE
39064|"_word_—the mode, peculiar to the intellect, of uttering its ideas most"|FALSE
39064|"worthily—is brought to consciousness and made an object of reflection."|FALSE
39064|"Engaging the attention of intelligence, as it does, it is analysed; the"|FALSE
39064|"work of sign-making is reduced to its few simple elements (the primary"|FALSE
39064|"postures of articulation) in which the sense-factor in speech is brought"|FALSE
39064|"to the form of universality, at the same time that in this elementary"|FALSE
39064|"phase it acquires complete precision and purity. Thus alphabetic writing"|FALSE
39064|"retains at the same time the advantage of vocal language, that the ideas"|FALSE
39064|"have names strictly so called: the name is the simple sign for the exact"|FALSE
39064|"idea, i.e. the simple plain idea, not decomposed into its features and"|FALSE
39064|"compounded out of them. Hieroglyphics, instead of springing from the"|FALSE
39064|"direct analysis of sensible signs, like alphabetic writing, arise from an"|FALSE
39064|"antecedent analysis of ideas. Thus a theory readily arises that all ideas"|FALSE
39064|"may be reduced to their elements, or simple logical terms, so that from"|FALSE
39064|"the elementary signs chosen to express these (as, in the case of the"|FALSE
39064|"Chinese _Koua_, the simple straight stroke, and the stroke broken into two"|FALSE
39064|"parts) a hieroglyphic system would be generated by their composition. This"|FALSE
39064|"feature of hieroglyphic—the analytical designations of ideas—which misled"|FALSE
39064|"Leibnitz to regard it as preferable to alphabetic writing is rather in"|FALSE
39064|"antagonism with the fundamental desideratum of language,—the name. To want"|FALSE
39064|"a name means that for the immediate idea (which, however ample a"|FALSE
39064|"connotation it may include, is still for the mind simple in the name), we"|FALSE
39064|"require a simple immediate sign which for its own sake does not suggest"|FALSE
39064|"anything, and has for its sole function to signify and represent sensibly"|FALSE
39064|"the simple idea as such. It is not merely the image-loving and"|FALSE
39064|"image-limited intelligence that lingers over the simplicity of ideas and"|FALSE
39064|"redintegrates them from the more abstract factors into which they have"|FALSE
39064|"been analysed: thought too reduces to the form of a simple thought the"|FALSE
39064|"concrete connotation which it “resumes” and reunites from the mere"|FALSE
39064|"aggregate of attributes to which analysis has reduced it. Both alike"|FALSE
39064|"require such signs, simple in respect of their meaning: signs, which"|FALSE
39064|"though consisting of several letters or syllables and even decomposed into"|FALSE
39064|"such, yet do not exhibit a combination of several ideas.—What has been"|FALSE
39064|"stated is the principle for settling the value of these written languages."|FALSE
39064|"It also follows that in hieroglyphics the relations of concrete mental"|FALSE
39064|"ideas to one another must necessarily be tangled and perplexed, and that"|FALSE
39064|"the analysis of these (and the proximate results of such analysis must"|FALSE
39064|"again be analysed) appears to be possible in the most various and"|FALSE
39064|"divergent ways. Every divergence in analysis would give rise to another"|FALSE
39064|"formation of the written name; just as in modern times (as already noted,"|FALSE
39064|"even in the region of sense) muriatic acid has undergone several changes"|FALSE
39064|"of name. A hieroglyphic written language would require a philosophy as"|FALSE
39064|"stationary as is the civilisation of the Chinese."|FALSE
39064|"What has been said shows the inestimable and not sufficiently appreciated"|FALSE
39064|"educational value of learning to read and write an alphabetic character."|FALSE
39064|"It leads the mind from the sensibly concrete image to attend to the more"|FALSE
39064|"formal structure of the vocal word and its abstract elements, and"|FALSE
39064|"contributes much to give stability and independence to the inward realm of"|FALSE
39064|"mental life. Acquired habit subsequently effaces the peculiarity by which"|FALSE
39064|"alphabetic writing appears, in the interest of vision, as a roundabout way"|FALSE
39064|"to ideas by means of audibility; it makes them a sort of hieroglyphic to"|FALSE
39064|"us, so that in using them we need not consciously realise them by means of"|FALSE
39064|"tones, whereas people unpractised in reading utter aloud what they read in"|FALSE
39064|"order to catch its meaning in the sound. Thus, while (with the faculty"|FALSE
39064|"which transformed alphabetic writing into hieroglyphics) the capacity of"|FALSE
39064|"abstraction gained by the first practice remains, hieroglyphic reading is"|FALSE
39064|"of itself a deaf reading and a dumb writing. It is true that the audible"|FALSE
39064|"(which is in time) and the visible (which is in space), each have their"|FALSE
39064|"own basis, one no less authoritative than the other. But in the case of"|FALSE
39064|"alphabetic writing there is only a _single_ basis: the two aspects occupy"|FALSE
39064|"their rightful relation to each other: the visible language is related to"|FALSE
39064|"the vocal only as a sign, and intelligence expresses itself immediately"|FALSE
39064|"and unconditionally by speaking.—The instrumental function of the"|FALSE
39064|"comparatively non-sensuous element of tone for all ideational work shows"|FALSE
39064|"itself further as peculiarly important in memory which forms the passage"|FALSE
39064|"from representation to thought."|FALSE
39064|"§ 460. The name, combining the intuition (an intellectual production) with"|FALSE
39064|"its signification, is primarily a single transient product; and"|FALSE
39064|"conjunction of the idea (which is inward) with the intuition (which is"|FALSE

39064|"intuition and image. The name, as giving an _existence_ to the content in"|FALSE

39064|"inwardising or recollection of the name, i.e. of an intuition of"|FALSE
39064|"intellectual origin, is at the same time a self-externalisation to which"|FALSE

39064|"In the phenomenal range right and duty are _correlata_, at least in the"|FALSE

39064|"diversity: and this diversity is increased by the variety of shapes which"|FALSE
39064|"value assumes in the course of exchange, though it remains intrinsically"|FALSE

39064|"§ 493. The two wills and their agreement in the contract are as an"|FALSE

39064|"_stipulation_ contains the actual surrender of a property by the one, its"|FALSE

39064|"§ 496. Law (right) considered as the realisation of liberty in externals,"|FALSE
39064|"breaks up into a multiplicity of relations to this external sphere and to"|FALSE
39064|"other persons (§§ 491, 493 seqq.). In this way there are (1) several"|FALSE
39064|"titles or grounds at law, of which (seeing that property both on the"|FALSE

39064|"right, but which, because they face each other, each and all are invested"|FALSE
39064|"with a _show_ of right, against which the former is defined as the"|FALSE
39064|"intrinsically right."|FALSE
39064|"§ 497. Now so long as (compared against this show) the one intrinsically"|FALSE
39064|"right, still presumed identical with the several titles, is affirmed,"|FALSE
39064|"willed, and recognised, the only diversity lies in this, that the special"|FALSE
39064|"thing is subsumed under the one law or right by the _particular_ will of"|FALSE
39064|"_these_ several persons. This is naïve, non-malicious wrong. Such wrong in"|FALSE
39064|"the several claimants is a simple _negative judgment_, expressing the"|FALSE
39064|"_civil suit_. To settle it there is required a third judgment, which, as"|FALSE
39064|"the judgment of the intrinsically right, is disinterested, and a power of"|FALSE
39064|"giving the one right existence as against that semblance."|FALSE
39064|"§ 498. But (2) if the semblance of right is willed as such _against_ right"|FALSE
39064|"intrinsical by the particular will, which thus becomes _wicked_, then the"|FALSE
39064|"external _recognition_ of right is separated from the right’s true value;"|FALSE
39064|"and while the former only is respected, the latter is violated. This gives"|FALSE
39064|"the wrong of _fraud_—the infinite judgment as identical (§ 173),—where the"|FALSE
39064|"nominal relation is retained, but the sterling value is let slip."|FALSE
39064|"§ 499. (3) Finally, the particular will sets itself in opposition to the"|FALSE
39064|"intrinsic right by negating that right itself as well as its recognition"|FALSE
39064|"or semblance. [Here there is a negatively infinite judgment (§ 173) in"|FALSE
39064|"which there is denied the class as a whole, and not merely the particular"|FALSE
39064|"mode—in this case the apparent recognition.] Thus the will is violently"|FALSE
39064|"wicked, and commits a _crime_."|FALSE
39064|"§ 500. As an outrage on right, such an action is essentially and actually"|FALSE
39064|"null. In it the agent, as a volitional and intelligent being, sets up a"|FALSE
39064|"law—a law however which is nominal and recognised by him only—a universal"|FALSE
39064|"which holds good _for him_, and under which he has at the same time"|FALSE
39064|"subsumed himself by his action. To display the nullity of such an act, to"|FALSE
39064|"carry out simultaneously this nominal law and the intrinsic right, in the"|FALSE
39064|"first instance by means of a subjective individual will, is the work of"|FALSE
39064|"_Revenge_. But, revenge, starting from the interest of an immediate"|FALSE
39064|"particular personality, is at the same time only a new outrage; and so on"|FALSE
39064|"without end. This progression, like the last, abolishes itself in a third"|FALSE
39064|"judgment, which is disinterested—_punishment_."|FALSE
39064|"§ 501. The instrumentality by which authority is given to intrinsic right"|FALSE
39064|"is (α) that a particular will, that of the judge, being conformable to the"|FALSE
39064|"right, has an interest to turn against the crime (—which in the first"|FALSE
39064|"instance, in revenge, is a matter of chance), and (β) that an executive"|FALSE
39064|"power (also in the first instance casual) negates the negation of right"|FALSE
39064|"that was created by the criminal. This negation of right has its existence"|FALSE
39064|"in the will of the criminal; and consequently revenge or punishment"|FALSE
39064|"directs itself against the person or property of the criminal and"|FALSE
39064|"exercises _coercion_ upon him. It is in this legal sphere that coercion in"|FALSE
39064|"general has possible scope,—compulsion against the thing, in seizing and"|FALSE
39064|"maintaining it against another’s seizure: for in this sphere the will has"|FALSE
39064|"its existence immediately in externals as such, or in corporeity, and can"|FALSE
39064|"be seized only in this quarter. But more than _possible_ compulsion is"|FALSE
39064|"not, so long as I can withdraw myself as free from every mode of"|FALSE
39064|"existence, even from the range of all existence, i.e. from life. It is"|FALSE
39064|"legal only as abolishing a first and original compulsion."|FALSE
39064|"§ 502. A distinction has thus emerged between the law (right) and the"|FALSE
39064|"subjective will. The “reality” of right, which the personal will in the"|FALSE
39064|"first instance gives itself in immediate wise, is seen to be due to the"|FALSE
39064|"instrumentality of the subjective will,—whose influence as on one hand it"|FALSE
39064|"gives existence to the essential right, so may on the other cut itself off"|FALSE
39064|"from and oppose itself to it. Conversely, the claim of the subjective will"|FALSE
39064|"to be in this abstraction a power over the law of right is null and empty"|FALSE
39064|"of itself: it gets truth and reality essentially only so far as that will"|FALSE
39064|"in itself realises the reasonable will. As such it is _morality_(153)"|FALSE
39064|"proper."|FALSE
39064|"The phrase “Law of Nature,” or Natural Right(154), in use for the"|FALSE

39064|"law of nature should hold sway; whereas the social and political state"|FALSE
39064|"rather required and implied a restriction of liberty and a sacrifice of"|FALSE

39064|"nullification of the universal—collapses by its own force. Wickedness, as"|FALSE
39064|"the most intimate reflection of subjectivity itself, in opposition to the"|FALSE
39064|"objective and universal, (which it treats as mere sham,) is the same as"|FALSE
39064|"the good sentiment of abstract goodness, which reserves to the"|FALSE
39064|"subjectivity the determination thereof:—the utterly abstract semblance,"|FALSE
39064|"the bare perversion and annihilation of itself. The result, the truth of"|FALSE

39064|"itself to gain definiteness, this analysis, because of the finitude of its"|FALSE
39064|"materials, falls into the falsely infinite progress: the _final_"|FALSE
39064|"definiteness, which is absolutely essential and causes a break in this"|FALSE
39064|"progress of unreality, can in this sphere of finitude be attained only in"|FALSE
39064|"a way that savours of contingency and arbitrariness. Thus whether three"|FALSE
39064|"years, ten thalers, or only 2-1/2, 2-3/4, 2-4/5 years, and so on _ad"|FALSE
39064|"infinitum_, be the right and just thing, can by no means be decided on"|FALSE
39064|"intelligible principles,—and yet it should be decided. Hence, though of"|FALSE
39064|"course only at the final points of deciding, on the side of external"|FALSE
39064|"existence, the “positive” principle naturally enters law as contingency"|FALSE
39064|"and arbitrariness. This happens and has from of old happened in all"|FALSE
39064|"legislations: the only thing wanted is clearly to be aware of it, and not"|FALSE
39064|"be misled by the talk and the pretence as if the ideal of law were, or"|FALSE
39064|"could be, to be, at _every_ point, determined through reason or legal"|FALSE
39064|"intelligence, on purely reasonable and intelligent grounds. It is a futile"|FALSE
39064|"perfectionism to have such expectations and to make such requirements in"|FALSE
39064|"the sphere of the finite."|FALSE
39064|"There are some who look upon laws as an evil and a profanity, and who"|FALSE

39064|"divinity or nobility, by faith and trust, as the genuine order of life,"|FALSE
39064|"while the reign of law is held an order of corruption and injustice. These"|FALSE
39064|"people forget that the stars—and the cattle too—are governed and well"|FALSE
39064|"governed too by laws;—laws however which are only internally in these"|FALSE
39064|"objects, not _for them_, not as laws _set to_ them:—whereas it is man’s"|FALSE

39064|"putting essential and universal provisions in one class with the"|FALSE
39064|"particular detail. The finite material is definable on and on to the false"|FALSE

39064|"generation of new spatial characteristics of the same quality as those"|FALSE
39064|"preceding them, but an advance into greater and ever greater speciality by"|FALSE
39064|"the acumen of the analytic intellect, which discovers new distinctions,"|FALSE
39064|"which again make new decisions necessary. To provisions of this sort one"|FALSE
39064|"may give the name of _new_ decisions or _new_ laws; but in proportion to"|FALSE
39064|"the gradual advance in specialisation the interest and value of these"|FALSE
39064|"provisions declines. They fall within the already subsisting"|FALSE
39064|"“substantial,” general laws, like improvements on a floor or a door,"|FALSE
39064|"within the house—which though something _new_, are not a new _house_. But"|FALSE
39064|"there is a contrary case. If the legislation of a rude age began with"|FALSE
39064|"single provisos, which go on by their very nature always increasing their"|FALSE
39064|"number, there arises, with the advance in multitude, the need of a simpler"|FALSE
39064|"code,—the need i.e. of embracing that lot of singulars in their general"|FALSE
39064|"features. To find and be able to express these principles well beseems an"|FALSE
39064|"intelligent and civilised nation. Such a gathering up of single rules into"|FALSE
39064|"general forms, first really deserving the name of laws, has lately been"|FALSE

39064|"institution they are allotted even to bodies differently qualified,—from"|FALSE
39064|"the one of which individuals belonging to the official judiciary are"|FALSE
39064|"expressly excluded. To carry this separation of functions up to this"|FALSE
39064|"separation in the courts rests rather on extra-essential considerations:"|FALSE
39064|"the main point remains only the separate performance of these essentially"|FALSE
39064|"different functions.—It is a more important point whether the confession"|FALSE
39064|"of the accused is or is not to be made a condition of penal judgment. The"|FALSE
39064|"institution of the jury-court loses sight of this condition. The point is"|FALSE
39064|"that on this ground certainty is completely inseparable from truth: but"|FALSE
39064|"the confession is to be regarded as the very acmé of certainty-giving"|FALSE
39064|"which in its nature is subjective. The final decision therefore lies with"|FALSE
39064|"the confession. To this therefore the accused has an absolute right, if"|FALSE
39064|"the proof is to be made final and the judges to be convinced. No doubt"|FALSE
39064|"this factor is incomplete, because it is only one factor; but still more"|FALSE

39064|"proofs, whilst at the same time their defect of certainty (incomplete in"|FALSE
39064|"so far as it is only _in them_) is admitted, the jury-court shows traces"|FALSE
39064|"of its barbaric origin in a confusion and admixture between objective"|FALSE
39064|"proofs and subjective or so-called “moral” conviction.—It is easy to call"|FALSE
39064|"_extraordinary_ punishments an absurdity; but the fault lies rather with"|FALSE
39064|"the shallowness which takes offence at a mere name. Materially the"|FALSE
39064|"principle involves the difference of objective probation according as it"|FALSE

39064|"weal. In civil society the sole end is to satisfy want—and that, because"|FALSE
39064|"it is man’s want, in a uniform general way, so as to _secure_ this"|FALSE
39064|"satisfaction. But the machinery of social necessity leaves in many ways a"|FALSE
39064|"casualness about this satisfaction. This is due to the variability of the"|FALSE

39064|"of creating disorder in it,—as also and especially from the unequal"|FALSE
39064|"capacity of individuals to take advantage of that general stock. The"|FALSE
39064|"onward march of this necessity also sacrifices the very particularities by"|FALSE

39064|"powers composing that social necessity act, and their variable"|FALSE

39064|"work of an institution which assumes on _one_ hand, to the concrete of"|FALSE
39064|"civil society, the position of an external universality. Such an order"|FALSE
39064|"acts with the power of an external state, which, in so far as it is rooted"|FALSE

39064|"restricted to the business of particular branches and interests. Thus we"|FALSE
39064|"have the _corporation_, in which the particular citizen in his private"|FALSE
39064|"capacity finds the securing of his stock, whilst at the same time he in it"|FALSE

39064|"Its _work_ generally—in relation to the extreme of individuality as the"|FALSE
39064|"multitude of individuals—consists in a double function. First it maintains"|FALSE
39064|"them as persons, thus making right a necessary actuality, then it promotes"|FALSE
39064|"their welfare, which each originally takes care of for himself, but which"|FALSE
39064|"has a thoroughly general side; it protects the family and guides civil"|FALSE
39064|"society. Secondly, it carries back both, and the whole disposition and"|FALSE

39064|"the various orders which parcel themselves more and more out of the"|FALSE
39064|"general particularising, and are a fruit of all the acts and private"|FALSE
39064|"concerns of individuals. Thirdly, they are the substance of the volition"|FALSE

39064|"produce it as their result. The _constitution_ is this articulation or"|FALSE

39064|"_found_; also for that will being put in actuality, through the action of"|FALSE
39064|"the government and its several branches, and not left to perish, but"|FALSE
39064|"protected both against _their_ casual subjectivity and against that of the"|FALSE
39064|"individuals. The constitution is existent _justice_,—the actuality of"|FALSE
39064|"liberty in the development all its reasonable provisions."|FALSE
39064|"Liberty and Equality are the simple rubrics into which is frequently"|FALSE
39064|"concentrated what should form the fundamental principle, the final aim and"|FALSE
39064|"result of the constitution. However true this is, the defect of these"|FALSE
39064|"terms is their utter abstractness: if stuck to in this abstract form, they"|FALSE
39064|"are principles which either prevent the rise of the concreteness of the"|FALSE
39064|"state, i.e. its articulation into a constitution and a government in"|FALSE
39064|"general, or destroy them. With the state there arises inequality, the"|FALSE
39064|"difference of governing powers and of governed, magistracies, authorities,"|FALSE
39064|"directories, &c. The principle of equality, logically carried out, rejects"|FALSE
39064|"all differences, and thus allows no sort of political condition to exist."|FALSE
39064|"Liberty and equality are indeed the foundation of the state, but as the"|FALSE
39064|"most abstract also the most superficial, and for that very reason"|FALSE
39064|"naturally the most familiar. It is important therefore to study them"|FALSE
39064|"closer."|FALSE
39064|"As regards, first, Equality, the familiar proposition, All men are by"|FALSE
39064|"nature equal, blunders by confusing the “natural” with the “notion.” It"|FALSE
39064|"ought rather to read: _By nature_ men are only unequal. But the notion of"|FALSE
39064|"liberty, as it exists as such, without further specification and"|FALSE
39064|"development, is abstract subjectivity, as a person capable of property (§"|FALSE
39064|"488). This single abstract feature of personality constitutes the actual"|FALSE
39064|"_equality_ of human beings. But that this freedom should exist, that it"|FALSE
39064|"should be _man_ (and not as in Greece, Rome, &c. _some_ men) that is"|FALSE
39064|"recognised and legally regarded as a person, is so little _by nature_,"|FALSE
39064|"that it is rather only a result and product of the consciousness of the"|FALSE
39064|"deepest principle of mind, and of the universality and expansion of this"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness. That the citizens are equal before the law contains a great"|FALSE
39064|"truth, but which so expressed is a tautology: it only states that the"|FALSE
39064|"legal status in general exists, that the laws rule. But, as regards the"|FALSE
39064|"concrete, the citizens—besides their personality—are equal before the law"|FALSE
39064|"only in these points when they are otherwise equal _outside the law_. Only"|FALSE
39064|"that equality which (in whatever way it be) they, as it happens, otherwise"|FALSE
39064|"have in property, age, physical strength, talent, skill, &c.—or even in"|FALSE
39064|"crime, can and ought to make them deserve equal treatment before the"|FALSE
39064|"law:—only it can make them—as regards taxation, military service,"|FALSE
39064|"eligibility to office, &c.—punishment, &c.—equal in the concrete. The laws"|FALSE
39064|"themselves, except in so far as they concern that narrow circle of"|FALSE
39064|"personality, presuppose unequal conditions, and provide for the unequal"|FALSE
39064|"legal duties and appurtenances resulting therefrom."|FALSE
39064|"As regards Liberty, it is originally taken partly in a negative sense"|FALSE
39064|"against arbitrary intolerance and lawless treatment, partly in the"|FALSE
39064|"affirmative sense of subjective freedom; but this freedom is allowed great"|FALSE
39064|"latitude both as regards the agent’s self-will and action for his"|FALSE
39064|"particular ends, and as regards his claim to have a personal intelligence"|FALSE
39064|"and a personal share in general affairs. Formerly the legally defined"|FALSE
39064|"rights, private as well as public rights of a nation, town, &c. were"|FALSE
39064|"called its “liberties.” Really, every genuine law is a liberty: it"|FALSE
39064|"contains a reasonable principle of objective mind; in other words, it"|FALSE
39064|"embodies a liberty. Nothing has become, on the contrary, more familiar"|FALSE
39064|"than the idea that each must _restrict_ his liberty in relation to the"|FALSE
39064|"liberty of others: that the state is a condition of such reciprocal"|FALSE
39064|"restriction, and that the laws are restrictions. To such habits of mind"|FALSE
39064|"liberty is viewed as only casual good-pleasure and self-will. Hence it has"|FALSE
39064|"also been said that “modern” nations are only susceptible of equality, or"|FALSE
39064|"of equality more than liberty: and that for no other reason than that,"|FALSE
39064|"with an assumed definition of liberty (chiefly the participation of all in"|FALSE
39064|"political affairs and actions), it was impossible to make ends meet in"|FALSE
39064|"actuality—which is at once more reasonable and more powerful than abstract"|FALSE
39064|"presuppositions. On the contrary, it should be said that it is just the"|FALSE
39064|"great development and maturity of form in modern states which produces the"|FALSE
39064|"supreme concrete inequality of individuals in actuality: while, through"|FALSE
39064|"the deeper reasonableness of laws and the greater stability of the legal"|FALSE
39064|"state, it gives rise to greater and more stable liberty, which it can"|FALSE
39064|"without incompatibility allow. Even the superficial distinction of the"|FALSE
39064|"words liberty and equality points to the fact that the former tends to"|FALSE
39064|"inequality: whereas, on the contrary, the current notions of liberty only"|FALSE
39064|"carry us back to equality. But the more we fortify liberty,—as security of"|FALSE
39064|"property, as possibility for each to develop and make the best of his"|FALSE
39064|"talents and good qualities, the more it gets taken for granted: and then"|FALSE
39064|"the sense and appreciation of liberty especially turns in a _subjective_"|FALSE
39064|"direction. By this is meant the liberty to attempt action on every side,"|FALSE
39064|"and to throw oneself at pleasure in action for particular and for general"|FALSE
39064|"intellectual interests, the removal of all checks on the individual"|FALSE
39064|"particularity, as well as the inward liberty in which the subject has"|FALSE
39064|"principles, has an insight and conviction of his own, and thus gains moral"|FALSE
39064|"independence. But this liberty itself on one hand implies that supreme"|FALSE
39064|"differentiation in which men are unequal and make themselves more unequal"|FALSE
39064|"by education; and on another it only grows up under conditions of that"|FALSE
39064|"objective liberty, and is and could grow to such height only in modern"|FALSE
39064|"states. If, with this development of particularity, there be simultaneous"|FALSE
39064|"and endless increase of the number of wants, and of the difficulty of"|FALSE
39064|"satisfying them, of the lust of argument and the fancy of detecting"|FALSE
39064|"faults, with its insatiate vanity, it is all but part of that"|FALSE
39064|"indiscriminating relaxation of individuality in this sphere which"|FALSE
39064|"generates all possible complications, and must deal with them as it can."|FALSE
39064|"Such a sphere is of course also the field of restrictions, because liberty"|FALSE
39064|"is there under the taint of natural self-will and self-pleasing, and has"|FALSE
39064|"therefore to restrict itself: and that, not merely with regard to the"|FALSE
39064|"naturalness, self-will and self-conceit, of others, but especially and"|FALSE
39064|"essentially with regard to reasonable liberty."|FALSE
39064|"The term political liberty, however, is often used to mean formal"|FALSE
39064|"participation in the public affairs of state by the will and action even"|FALSE
39064|"of those individuals who otherwise find their chief function in the"|FALSE
39064|"particular aims and business of civil society. And it has in part become"|FALSE
39064|"usual to give the title constitution only to the side of the state which"|FALSE
39064|"concerns such participation of these individuals in general affairs, and"|FALSE
39064|"to regard a state, in which this is not formally done, as a state without"|FALSE
39064|"a constitution. On this use of the term, the only thing to remark is that"|FALSE
39064|"by constitution must be understood the determination of rights, i.e. of"|FALSE
39064|"liberties in general, and the organisation of the actualisation of them;"|FALSE
39064|"and that political freedom in the above sense can in any case only"|FALSE
39064|"constitute a part of it. Of it the following paragraphs will speak."|FALSE
39064|"§ 540. The guarantee of a constitution (i.e. the necessity that the laws"|FALSE
39064|"be reasonable, and their actualisation secured) lies in the collective"|FALSE
39064|"spirit of the nation,—especially in the specific way in which it is itself"|FALSE
39064|"conscious of its reason. (Religion is that consciousness in its absolute"|FALSE
39064|"substantiality.) But the guarantee lies also at the same time in the"|FALSE
39064|"actual organisation or development of that principle in suitable"|FALSE
39064|"institutions. The constitution presupposes that consciousness of the"|FALSE
39064|"collective spirit, and conversely that spirit presupposes the"|FALSE
39064|"constitution: for the actual spirit only has a definite consciousness of"|FALSE
39064|"its principles, in so far as it has them actually existent before it."|FALSE
39064|"The question—To whom (to what authority and how organised) belongs the"|FALSE
39064|"power to make a constitution? is the same as the question, Who has to make"|FALSE
39064|"the spirit of a nation? Separate our idea of a constitution from that of"|FALSE
39064|"the collective spirit, as if the latter exists or has existed without a"|FALSE
39064|"constitution, and your fancy only proves how superficially you have"|FALSE
39064|"apprehended the nexus between the spirit in its self-consciousness and in"|FALSE
39064|"its actuality. What is thus called “making” a “constitution,” is—just"|FALSE
39064|"because of this inseparability—a thing that has never happened in history,"|FALSE
39064|"just as little as the making of a code of laws. A constitution only"|FALSE
39064|"develops from the national spirit identically with that spirit’s own"|FALSE
39064|"development, and runs through at the same time with it the grades of"|FALSE
39064|"formation and the alterations required by its concept. It is the"|FALSE

39064|"structures in the path of development,—in short, in the history of the"|FALSE
39064|"State. Hence it is superficial and absurd to represent them as an object"|FALSE
39064|"of _choice_. The pure forms—necessary to the process of evolution—are, in"|FALSE
39064|"so far as they are finite and in course of change, conjoined both with"|FALSE
39064|"forms of their degeneration,—such as ochlocracy, &c., and with earlier"|FALSE
39064|"transition-forms. These two forms are not to be confused with those"|FALSE
39064|"legitimate structures. Thus, it may be—if we look only to the fact that"|FALSE
39064|"the will of one individual stands at the head of the state—oriental"|FALSE
39064|"despotism is included under the vague name monarchy,—as also feudal"|FALSE
39064|"monarchy, to which indeed even the favourite name of “constitutional"|FALSE
39064|"monarchy” cannot be refused. The true difference of these forms from"|FALSE
39064|"genuine monarchy depends on the true value of those principles of right"|FALSE
39064|"which are in vogue and have their actuality and guarantee in the"|FALSE
39064|"state-power. These principles are those expounded earlier, liberty of"|FALSE
39064|"property, and above all personal liberty, civil society, with its industry"|FALSE
39064|"and its communities, and the regulated efficiency of the particular"|FALSE
39064|"bureaux in subordination to the laws."|FALSE
39064|"The question which is most discussed is in what sense we are to understand"|FALSE
39064|"the participation of private persons in state affairs. For it is as"|FALSE
39064|"private persons that the members of bodies of estates are primarily to be"|FALSE
39064|"taken, be they treated as mere individuals, or as representatives of a"|FALSE
39064|"number of people or of the nation. The aggregate of private persons is"|FALSE
39064|"often spoken of as the _nation_: but as such an aggregate it is _vulgus_,"|FALSE
39064|"not _populus_: and in this direction, it is the one sole aim of the state"|FALSE
39064|"that a nation should _not_ come to existence, to power and action, _as"|FALSE
39064|"such an aggregate_. Such a condition of a nation is a condition of"|FALSE
39064|"lawlessness, demoralisation, brutishness: in it the nation would only be a"|FALSE
39064|"shapeless, wild, blind force, like that of the stormy, elemental sea,"|FALSE
39064|"which however is not self-destructive, as the nation—a spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"element—would be. Yet such a condition may be often heard described as"|FALSE
39064|"that of true freedom. If there is to be any sense in embarking upon the"|FALSE
39064|"question of the participation of private persons in public affairs, it is"|FALSE
39064|"not a brutish mass, but an already organised nation—one in which a"|FALSE
39064|"governmental power exists—which should be presupposed. The desirability of"|FALSE
39064|"such participation however is not to be put in the superiority of"|FALSE
39064|"particular intelligence, which private persons are supposed to have over"|FALSE
39064|"state officials—the contrary may be the case—nor in the superiority of"|FALSE
39064|"their good will for the general best. The members of civil society as such"|FALSE
39064|"are rather people who find their nearest duty in their private interest"|FALSE
39064|"and (as especially in the feudal society) in the interest of their"|FALSE
39064|"privileged corporation. Take the case of _England_ which, because private"|FALSE
39064|"persons have a predominant share in public affairs, has been regarded as"|FALSE
39064|"having the freest of all constitutions. Experience shows that that"|FALSE
39064|"country—as compared with the other civilised states of Europe—is the most"|FALSE
39064|"backward in civil and criminal legislation, in the law and liberty of"|FALSE
39064|"property, in arrangements for art and science, and that objective freedom"|FALSE
39064|"or rational right is rather _sacrificed_ to formal right and particular"|FALSE
39064|"private interest; and that this happens even in the institutions and"|FALSE
39064|"possessions supposed to be dedicated to religion. The desirability of"|FALSE
39064|"private persons taking part in public affairs is partly to be put in their"|FALSE
39064|"concrete, and therefore more urgent, sense of general wants. But the true"|FALSE
39064|"motive is the right of the collective spirit to appear as an _externally"|FALSE
39064|"universal_ will, acting with orderly and express efficacy for the public"|FALSE
39064|"concerns. By this satisfaction of this right it gets its own life"|FALSE
39064|"quickened, and at the same time breathes fresh life in the administrative"|FALSE
39064|"officials; who thus have it brought home to them that not merely have they"|FALSE
39064|"to enforce duties but also to have regard to rights. Private citizens are"|FALSE
39064|"in the state the incomparably greater number, and form the multitude of"|FALSE
39064|"such as are recognised as persons. Hence the will-reason exhibits its"|FALSE
39064|"existence in them as a preponderating majority of freemen, or in its"|FALSE
39064|"“reflectional” universality, which has its actuality vouchsafed it as a"|FALSE
39064|"participation in the sovereignty. But it has already been noted as a"|FALSE
39064|"“moment” of civil society (§§ 527, 534) that the individuals rise from"|FALSE
39064|"external into substantial universality, and form a _particular_ kind,—the"|FALSE
39064|"Estates: and it is not in the inorganic form of mere individuals as such"|FALSE
39064|"(after the _democratic_ fashion of election), but as organic factors, as"|FALSE
39064|"estates, that they enter upon that participation. In the state a power or"|FALSE
39064|"agency must never appear and act as a formless, inorganic shape, i.e."|FALSE
39064|"basing itself on the principle of multeity and mere numbers."|FALSE
39064|"Assemblies of Estates have been wrongly designated as the _legislative"|FALSE
39064|"power_, so far as they form only one branch of that power,—a branch in"|FALSE
39064|"which the special government-officials have an _ex officio_ share, while"|FALSE
39064|"the sovereign power has the privilege of final decision. In a civilised"|FALSE
39064|"state moreover legislation can only be a further modification of existing"|FALSE
39064|"law, and so-called new laws can only deal with minutiae of detail and"|FALSE
39064|"particularities (cf. § 529, note), the main drift of which has been"|FALSE
39064|"already prepared or preliminarily settled by the practice of the"|FALSE
39064|"law-courts. The so-called _financial law_, in so far as it requires the"|FALSE
39064|"assent of the estates, is really a government affair: it is only"|FALSE
39064|"improperly called a law, in the general sense of embracing a wide, indeed"|FALSE
39064|"the whole, range of the external means of government. The finances deal"|FALSE
39064|"with what in their nature are only particular needs, ever newly recurring,"|FALSE
39064|"even if they touch on the sum total of such needs. If the main part of the"|FALSE
39064|"requirement were—as it very likely is—regarded as permanent, the provision"|FALSE
39064|"for it would have more the nature of a law: but to be a law, it would have"|FALSE
39064|"to be made once for all, and not be made yearly, or every few years,"|FALSE
39064|"afresh. The part which varies according to time and circumstances concerns"|FALSE
39064|"in reality the smallest part of the amount, and the provisions with regard"|FALSE
39064|"to it have even less the character of a law: and yet it is and may be only"|FALSE
39064|"this slight variable part which is matter of dispute, and can be subjected"|FALSE
39064|"to a varying yearly estimate. It is this last then which falsely bears the"|FALSE
39064|"high-sounding name of the “_Grant_” of the _Budget_, i.e. of the whole of"|FALSE
39064|"the finances. A law for one year and made each year has even to the plain"|FALSE
39064|"man something palpably absurd: for he distinguishes the essential and"|FALSE
39064|"developed universal, as content of a true law, from the reflectional"|FALSE
39064|"universality which only externally embraces what in its nature is many. To"|FALSE
39064|"give the name of a law to the annual fixing of financial requirements only"|FALSE
39064|"serves—with the presupposed separation of legislative from executive—to"|FALSE
39064|"keep up the illusion of that separation having real existence, and to"|FALSE
39064|"conceal the fact that the legislative power, when it makes a decree about"|FALSE
39064|"finance, is really engaged with strict executive business. But the"|FALSE
39064|"importance attached to the power of from time to time granting “supply,”"|FALSE
39064|"on the ground that the assembly of estates possesses in it a _check_ on"|FALSE
39064|"the government, and thus a guarantee against injustice and violence,—this"|FALSE
39064|"importance is in one way rather plausible than real. The financial"|FALSE
39064|"measures necessary for the state’s subsistence cannot be made conditional"|FALSE
39064|"on any other circumstances, nor can the state’s subsistence be put yearly"|FALSE
39064|"in doubt. It would be a parallel absurdity if the government were e.g. to"|FALSE
39064|"grant and arrange the judicial institutions always for a limited time"|FALSE
39064|"merely; and thus, by the threat of suspending the activity of such an"|FALSE
39064|"institution and the fear of a consequent state of brigandage, reserve for"|FALSE
39064|"itself a means of coercing private individuals. Then again, the pictures"|FALSE
39064|"of a condition of affairs, in which it might be useful and necessary to"|FALSE
39064|"have in hand means of compulsion, are partly based on the false conception"|FALSE
39064|"of a contract between rulers and ruled, and partly presuppose the"|FALSE
39064|"possibility of such a divergence in spirit between these two parties as"|FALSE
39064|"would make constitution and government quite out of the question. If we"|FALSE
39064|"suppose the empty possibility of getting _help_ by such compulsive means"|FALSE
39064|"brought into existence, such help would rather be the derangement and"|FALSE
39064|"dissolution of the state, in which there would no longer be a government,"|FALSE
39064|"but only parties, and the violence and oppression of one party would only"|FALSE
39064|"be helped away by the other. To fit together the several parts of the"|FALSE
39064|"state into a constitution after the fashion of mere understanding—i.e. to"|FALSE
39064|"adjust within it the machinery of a balance of powers external to each"|FALSE
39064|"other—is to contravene the fundamental idea of what a state is."|FALSE
39064|"§ 545. The final aspect of the state is to appear in immediate actuality"|FALSE
39064|"as a single nation marked by physical conditions. As a single individual"|FALSE
39064|"it is exclusive against other like individuals. In their mutual relations,"|FALSE
39064|"waywardness and chance have a place; for each person in the aggregate is"|FALSE
39064|"autonomous: the universal of law is only postulated between them, and not"|FALSE
39064|"actually existent. This independence of a central authority reduces"|FALSE
39064|"disputes between them to terms of mutual violence, a _state of war_, to"|FALSE
39064|"meet which the general estate in the community assumes the particular"|FALSE
39064|"function of maintaining the state’s independence against other states, and"|FALSE
39064|"becomes the estate of bravery."|FALSE

39064|"independence of individuals and their absorption in the external existence"|FALSE
39064|"of possession and in natural life is convicted of its own nullity,—as the"|FALSE
39064|"power which procures the maintenance of the general substance by the"|FALSE

39064|"both this general recognition, and the special claims of nations on one"|FALSE

39064|"substance, the deed by which the absolute final aim of the world is"|FALSE
39064|"realised in it, and the merely implicit mind achieves consciousness and"|FALSE
39064|"self-consciousness. It is thus the revelation and actuality of its"|FALSE
39064|"essential and completed essence, whereby it becomes to the outward eye a"|FALSE
39064|"universal spirit—a world-mind. As this development is in time and in real"|FALSE

39064|"The presupposition that history has an essential and actual end, from the"|FALSE

39064|"_objective purpose_. This is after all synonymous with what _seems_ to be"|FALSE
39064|"the still more legitimate demand that the historian should proceed with"|FALSE
39064|"_impartiality_. This is a requirement often and especially made on the"|FALSE
39064|"_history of philosophy_: where it is insisted there should be no"|FALSE
39064|"prepossession in favour of an idea or opinion, just as a judge should have"|FALSE
39064|"no special sympathy for one of the contending parties. In the case of the"|FALSE
39064|"judge it is at the same time assumed that he would administer his office"|FALSE
39064|"ill and foolishly, if he had not an interest, and an exclusive interest in"|FALSE
39064|"justice, if he had not that for his aim and one sole aim, or if he"|FALSE
39064|"declined to judge at all. This requirement which we may make upon the"|FALSE
39064|"judge may be called _partiality_ for justice; and there is no difficulty"|FALSE
39064|"here in distinguishing it from _subjective_ partiality. But in speaking of"|FALSE
39064|"the impartiality required from the historian, this self-satisfied insipid"|FALSE
39064|"chatter lets the distinction disappear, and rejects both kinds of"|FALSE
39064|"interest. It demands that the historian shall bring with him no definite"|FALSE
39064|"aim and view by which he may sort out, state and criticise events, but"|FALSE
39064|"shall narrate them exactly in the casual mode he finds them, in their"|FALSE
39064|"incoherent and unintelligent particularity. Now it is at least admitted"|FALSE
39064|"that a history must have an object, e.g. Rome and its fortunes, or the"|FALSE
39064|"Decline of the grandeur of the Roman empire. But little reflection is"|FALSE
39064|"needed to discover that this is the presupposed end which lies at the"|FALSE
39064|"basis of the events themselves, as of the critical examination into their"|FALSE
39064|"comparative importance, i.e. their nearer or more remote relation to it. A"|FALSE
39064|"history without such aim and such criticism would be only an imbecile"|FALSE
39064|"mental divagation, not as good as a fairy tale, for even children expect a"|FALSE
39064|"_motif_ in their stories, a purpose at least dimly surmiseable with which"|FALSE
39064|"events and actions are put in relation."|FALSE
39064|"In the existence of a _nation_ the substantial aim is to be a state and"|FALSE
39064|"preserve itself as such. A nation with no state formation, (a _mere"|FALSE
39064|"nation_), has strictly speaking no history,—like the nations which existed"|FALSE
39064|"before the rise of states and others which still exist in a condition of"|FALSE
39064|"savagery. What happens to a nation, and takes place within it, has its"|FALSE
39064|"essential significance in relation to the state: whereas the mere"|FALSE
39064|"particularities of individuals are at the greatest distance from the true"|FALSE
39064|"object of history. It is true that the general spirit of an age leaves its"|FALSE
39064|"imprint in the character of its celebrated individuals, and even their"|FALSE
39064|"particularities are but the very distant and the dim media through which"|FALSE
39064|"the collective light still plays in fainter colours. Ay, even such"|FALSE
39064|"singularities as a petty occurrence, a word, express not a subjective"|FALSE
39064|"particularity, but an age, a nation, a civilisation, in striking"|FALSE
39064|"portraiture and brevity; and to select such trifles shows the hand of a"|FALSE
39064|"historian of genius. But, on the other hand, the main mass of"|FALSE
39064|"singularities is a futile and useless mass, by the painstaking"|FALSE
39064|"accumulation of which the objects of real historical value are overwhelmed"|FALSE
39064|"and obscured. The essential characteristic of the spirit and its age is"|FALSE
39064|"always contained in the great events. It was a correct instinct which"|FALSE
39064|"sought to banish such portraiture of the particular and the gleaning of"|FALSE
39064|"insignificant traits, into the _Novel_ (as in the celebrated romances of"|FALSE
39064|"Walter Scott, &c.). Where the picture presents an unessential aspect of"|FALSE
39064|"life it is certainly in good taste to conjoin it with an unessential"|FALSE
39064|"material, such as the romance takes from private events and subjective"|FALSE
39064|"passions. But to take the individual pettinesses of an age and of the"|FALSE
39064|"persons in it, and, in the interest of so-called truth, weave them into"|FALSE
39064|"the picture of general interests, is not only against taste and judgment,"|FALSE
39064|"but violates the principles of objective truth. The only truth for mind is"|FALSE
39064|"the substantial and underlying essence, and not the trivialities of"|FALSE
39064|"external existence and contingency. It is therefore completely indifferent"|FALSE
39064|"whether such insignificancies are duly vouched for by documents, or, as in"|FALSE
39064|"the romance, invented to suit the character and ascribed to this or that"|FALSE
39064|"name and circumstances."|FALSE
39064|"The point of interest of _Biography_—to say a word on that here—appears to"|FALSE
39064|"run directly counter to any universal scope and aim. But biography too has"|FALSE
39064|"for its background the historical world, with which the individual is"|FALSE
39064|"intimately bound up: even purely personal originality, the freak of"|FALSE
39064|"humour, &c. suggests by allusion that central reality and has its interest"|FALSE
39064|"heightened by the suggestion. The mere play of sentiment, on the contrary,"|FALSE
39064|"has another ground and interest than history."|FALSE
39064|"The requirement of impartiality addressed to the history of philosophy"|FALSE
39064|"(and also, we may add, to the history of religion, first in general, and"|FALSE
39064|"secondly, to church history) generally implies an even more decided bar"|FALSE
39064|"against presupposition of any objective aim. As the State was already"|FALSE
39064|"called the point to which in political history criticism had to refer all"|FALSE
39064|"events, so here the “_Truth_” must be the object to which the several"|FALSE
39064|"deeds and events of the spirit would have to be referred. What is actually"|FALSE
39064|"done is rather to make the contrary presupposition. Histories with such an"|FALSE
39064|"object as religion or philosophy are understood to have only subjective"|FALSE
39064|"aims for their theme, i.e. only opinions and mere ideas, not an essential"|FALSE
39064|"and realised object like the truth. And that with the mere excuse that"|FALSE
39064|"there is no truth. On this assumption the sympathy with truth appears as"|FALSE
39064|"only a partiality of the usual sort, a partiality for opinion and mere"|FALSE
39064|"ideas, which all alike have no stuff in them, and are all treated as"|FALSE
39064|"indifferent. In that way historical truth means but correctness—an"|FALSE
39064|"accurate report of externals, without critical treatment save as regards"|FALSE
39064|"this correctness—admitting, in this case, only qualitative and"|FALSE
39064|"quantitative judgments, no judgments of necessity or notion (cf. notes to"|FALSE

39064|"universal history the genuine spirit, the consciousness of it and of its"|FALSE
39064|"essence, is even in a higher degree a true and actual object and theme,"|FALSE
39064|"and an aim to which all other phenomena are essentially and actually"|FALSE

39064|"and is alone its principle of movement: and in the path of that spirit,"|FALSE

39064|"to realise its truth, and the business of so doing, is the supreme right,"|FALSE

39064|"and therefore as a work of _individuals_, these individuals, as regards"|FALSE
39064|"the substantial issue of their labour, are _instruments_, and their"|FALSE
39064|"subjectivity, which is what is peculiar to them, is the empty form of"|FALSE
39064|"activity. What they personally have gained therefore through the"|FALSE
39064|"individual share they took in the substantial business (prepared and"|FALSE

39064|"external existence (§ 423): the ethical substance, potentially infinite,"|FALSE
39064|"is actually a particular and limited substance (§§ 549, 550); on its"|FALSE
39064|"subjective side it labours under contingency, in the shape of its"|FALSE
39064|"unreflective natural usages, and its content is presented to it as"|FALSE
39064|"something _existing_ in time and tied to an external nature and external"|FALSE

39064|"overrides and absorbs within itself the finitude attaching to it as"|FALSE
39064|"national spirit in its state and the state’s temporal interests, in the"|FALSE
39064|"system of laws and usages. It rises to apprehend itself in its"|FALSE
39064|"essentiality. Such apprehension, however, still has the immanent"|FALSE
39064|"limitedness of the national spirit. But the spirit which thinks in"|FALSE
39064|"universal history, stripping off at the same time those limitations of the"|FALSE
39064|"several national minds and its own temporal restrictions, lays hold of its"|FALSE
39064|"concrete universality, and rises to apprehend the absolute mind, as the"|FALSE
39064|"eternally actual truth in which the contemplative reason enjoys freedom,"|FALSE
39064|"while the necessity of nature and the necessity of history are only"|FALSE
39064|"ministrant to its revelation and the vessels of its honour."|FALSE
39064|"The strictly technical aspects of the Mind’s elevation to God have been"|FALSE
39064|"spoken of in the Introduction to the Logic (cf. especially § 51, note). As"|FALSE
39064|"regards the starting-point of that elevation, Kant has on the whole"|FALSE
39064|"adopted the most correct, when he treats belief in God as proceeding from"|FALSE
39064|"the practical Reason. For that starting-point contains the material or"|FALSE
39064|"content which constitutes the content of the notion of God. But the true"|FALSE
39064|"concrete material is neither Being (as in the cosmological) nor mere"|FALSE
39064|"action by design (as in the physico-theological proof) but the Mind, the"|FALSE
39064|"absolute characteristic and function of which is effective reason, i.e."|FALSE
39064|"the self-determining and self-realising notion itself,—Liberty. That the"|FALSE
39064|"elevation of subjective mind to God which these considerations give is by"|FALSE
39064|"Kant again deposed to a _postulate_—a mere “ought”—is the peculiar"|FALSE
39064|"perversity, formerly noticed, of calmly and simply reinstating as true and"|FALSE
39064|"valid that very antithesis of finitude, the supersession of which into"|FALSE
39064|"truth is the essence of that elevation."|FALSE
39064|"As regards the “mediation” which, as it has been already shown (§ 192, cf."|FALSE
39064|"§ 204 note), that elevation to God really involves, the point specially"|FALSE
39064|"calling for note is the “moment” of negation through which the essential"|FALSE
39064|"content of the starting-point is purged of its finitude so as to come"|FALSE
39064|"forth free. This factor, abstract in the formal treatment of logic, now"|FALSE
39064|"gets its most concrete interpretation. The finite, from which the start is"|FALSE
39064|"now made, is the real ethical self-consciousness. The negation through"|FALSE
39064|"which that consciousness raises its spirit to its truth, is the"|FALSE
39064|"purification, _actually_ accomplished in the ethical world, whereby its"|FALSE
39064|"conscience is purged of subjective opinion and its will freed from the"|FALSE
39064|"selfishness of desire. Genuine religion and genuine religiosity only issue"|FALSE
39064|"from the moral life: religion is that life rising to think, i.e. becoming"|FALSE
39064|"aware of the free universality of its concrete essence. Only from the"|FALSE
39064|"moral life and by the moral life is the Idea of God seen to be free"|FALSE
39064|"spirit: outside the ethical spirit therefore it is vain to seek for true"|FALSE
39064|"religion and religiosity."|FALSE
39064|"But—as is the case with all speculative process—this development of one"|FALSE
39064|"thing out of another means that what appears as sequel and derivative is"|FALSE
39064|"rather the absolute _prius_ of what it appears to be mediated by, and what"|FALSE
39064|"is here in mind known as its truth."|FALSE
39064|"Here then is the place to go more deeply into the reciprocal relations"|FALSE
39064|"between the state and religion, and in doing so to elucidate the"|FALSE
39064|"terminology which is familiar and current on the topic. It is evident and"|FALSE
39064|"apparent from what has preceded that moral life is the state retracted"|FALSE
39064|"into its inner heart and substance, while the state is the organisation"|FALSE
39064|"and actualisation of moral life; and that religion is the very substance"|FALSE
39064|"of the moral life itself and of the state. At this rate, the state rests"|FALSE
39064|"on the ethical sentiment, and that on the religious. If religion then is"|FALSE
39064|"the consciousness of “absolute”_ truth_, then whatever is to rank as right"|FALSE
39064|"and justice, as law and duty, i.e. as _true_ in the world of free will,"|FALSE
39064|"can be so esteemed only as it is participant in that truth, as it is"|FALSE
39064|"subsumed under it and is its sequel. But if the truly moral life is to be"|FALSE
39064|"a sequel of religion, then perforce religion must have the _genuine_"|FALSE
39064|"content; i.e. the idea of God it knows must be the true and real. The"|FALSE
39064|"ethical life is the divine spirit as indwelling in self-consciousness, as"|FALSE
39064|"it is actually present in a nation and its individual members. This"|FALSE
39064|"self-consciousness retiring upon itself out of its empirical actuality and"|FALSE
39064|"bringing its truth to consciousness, has in its _faith_ and in its"|FALSE
39064|"_conscience_ only what it has consciously secured in its spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"actuality. The two are inseparable: there cannot be two kinds of"|FALSE
39064|"conscience, one religious and another ethical, differing from the former"|FALSE
39064|"in body and value of truth. But in point of form, i.e. for thought and"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge—(and religion and ethical life belong to intelligence and are a"|FALSE
39064|"thinking and knowing)—the body of religious truth, as the pure"|FALSE
39064|"self-subsisting and therefore supreme truth, exercises a sanction over the"|FALSE
39064|"moral life which lies in empirical actuality. Thus for self-consciousness"|FALSE
39064|"religion is the “basis” of moral life and of the state. It has been the"|FALSE
39064|"monstrous blunder of our times to try to look upon these inseparables as"|FALSE
39064|"separable from one another, and even as mutually indifferent. The view"|FALSE
39064|"taken of the relationship of religion and the state has been that, whereas"|FALSE
39064|"the state had an independent existence of its own, springing from some"|FALSE
39064|"force and power, religion was a later addition, something desirable"|FALSE
39064|"perhaps for strengthening the political bulwarks, but purely subjective in"|FALSE
39064|"individuals:—or it may be, religion is treated as something without effect"|FALSE
39064|"on the moral life of the state, i.e. its reasonable law and constitution"|FALSE
39064|"which are based on a ground of their own."|FALSE
39064|"As the inseparability of the two sides has been indicated, it may be worth"|FALSE
39064|"while to note the separation as it appears on the side of religion. It is"|FALSE
39064|"primarily a point of form: the attitude which self-consciousness takes to"|FALSE
39064|"the body of truth. So long as this body of truth is the very substance or"|FALSE
39064|"indwelling spirit of self-consciousness in its actuality, then"|FALSE
39064|"self-consciousness in this content has the certainty of itself and is"|FALSE
39064|"free. But if this present self-consciousness is lacking, then there may be"|FALSE
39064|"created, in point of form, a condition of spiritual slavery, even though"|FALSE
39064|"the _implicit_ content of religion is absolute spirit. This great"|FALSE
39064|"difference (to cite a specific case) comes out within the Christian"|FALSE
39064|"religion itself, even though here it is not the nature-element in which"|FALSE
39064|"the idea of God is embodied, and though nothing of the sort even enters as"|FALSE
39064|"a factor into its central dogma and sole theme of a God who is known in"|FALSE
39064|"spirit and in truth. And yet in Catholicism this spirit of all truth is in"|FALSE
39064|"actuality set in rigid opposition to the self-conscious spirit. And, first"|FALSE
39064|"of all, God is in the “host” presented to religious adoration as an"|FALSE
39064|"_external thing_. (In the Lutheran Church, on the contrary, the host as"|FALSE
39064|"such is not at first consecrated, but in the moment of enjoyment, i.e. in"|FALSE
39064|"the annihilation of its externality, and in the act of faith, i.e. in the"|FALSE
39064|"free self-certain spirit: only then is it consecrated and exalted to be"|FALSE
39064|"present God.) From that first and supreme status of externalisation flows"|FALSE
39064|"every other phase of externality,—of bondage, non-spirituality, and"|FALSE
39064|"superstition. It leads to a laity, receiving its knowledge of divine"|FALSE
39064|"truth, as well as the direction of its will and conscience from without"|FALSE
39064|"and from another order—which order again does not get possession of that"|FALSE
39064|"knowledge in a spiritual way only, but to that end essentially requires an"|FALSE
39064|"external consecration. It leads to the non-spiritual style of"|FALSE
39064|"praying—partly as mere moving of the lips, partly in the way that the"|FALSE
39064|"subject foregoes his right of directly addressing God, and prays others to"|FALSE
39064|"pray—addressing his devotion to miracle-working images, even to bones, and"|FALSE
39064|"expecting miracles from them. It leads, generally, to justification by"|FALSE
39064|"external works, a merit which is supposed to be gained by acts, and even"|FALSE
39064|"to be capable of being transferred to others. All this binds the spirit"|FALSE
39064|"under an externalism by which the very meaning of spirit is perverted and"|FALSE
39064|"misconceived at its source, and law and justice, morality and conscience,"|FALSE
39064|"responsibility and duty are corrupted at their root."|FALSE
39064|"Along with this principle of spiritual bondage, and these applications of"|FALSE
39064|"it in the religious life, there can only go in the legislative and"|FALSE
39064|"constitutional system a legal and moral bondage, and a state of"|FALSE
39064|"lawlessness and immorality in political life. Catholicism has been loudly"|FALSE
39064|"praised and is still often praised—logically enough—as the one religion"|FALSE
39064|"which secures the stability of governments. But in reality this applies"|FALSE
39064|"only to governments which are bound up with institutions founded on the"|FALSE
39064|"bondage of the spirit (of that spirit which should have legal and moral"|FALSE
39064|"liberty), i.e. with institutions that embody injustice and with a morally"|FALSE
39064|"corrupt and barbaric state of society. But these governments are not aware"|FALSE
39064|"that in fanaticism they have a terrible power, which does not rise in"|FALSE
39064|"hostility against them, only so long as and only on condition that they"|FALSE
39064|"remain sunk in the thraldom of injustice and immorality. But in mind there"|FALSE
39064|"is a very different power available against that externalism and"|FALSE
39064|"dismemberment induced by a false religion. Mind collects itself into its"|FALSE
39064|"inward free actuality. Philosophy awakes in the spirit of governments and"|FALSE
39064|"nations the wisdom to discern what is essentially and actually right and"|FALSE
39064|"reasonable in the real world. It was well to call these products of"|FALSE
39064|"thought, and in a special sense Philosophy, the wisdom of the world(170);"|FALSE
39064|"for thought makes the spirit’s truth an actual present, leads it into the"|FALSE
39064|"real world, and thus liberates it in its actuality and in its own self."|FALSE
39064|"Thus set free, the content of religion assumes quite another shape. So"|FALSE
39064|"long as the form, i.e. our consciousness and subjectivity, lacked liberty,"|FALSE
39064|"it followed necessarily that self-consciousness was conceived as not"|FALSE
39064|"immanent in the ethical principles which religion embodies, and these"|FALSE
39064|"principles were set at such a distance as to seem to have true being only"|FALSE
39064|"as negative to actual self-consciousness. In this unreality ethical"|FALSE
39064|"content gets the name of _Holiness_. But once the divine spirit introduces"|FALSE
39064|"itself into actuality, and actuality emancipates itself to spirit, then"|FALSE
39064|"what in the world was a postulate of holiness is supplanted by the"|FALSE
39064|"actuality of _moral_ life. Instead of the vow of chastity, _marriage_ now"|FALSE
39064|"ranks as the ethical relation; and, therefore, as the highest on this side"|FALSE
39064|"of humanity stands the family. Instead of the vow of poverty (muddled up"|FALSE
39064|"into a contradiction of assigning merit to whosoever gives away goods to"|FALSE
39064|"the poor, i.e. whosoever enriches them) is the precept of action to"|FALSE
39064|"acquire goods through one’s own intelligence and industry,—of honesty in"|FALSE
39064|"commercial dealing, and in the use of property,—in short moral life in the"|FALSE
39064|"socio-economic sphere. And instead of the vow of obedience, true religion"|FALSE
39064|"sanctions obedience to the law and the legal arrangements of the state—an"|FALSE
39064|"obedience which is itself the true freedom, because the state is a"|FALSE
39064|"self-possessed, self-realising reason—in short, moral life in the state."|FALSE
39064|"Thus, and thus only, can law and morality exist. The precept of religion,"|FALSE
39064|"“Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s” is not enough:"|FALSE
39064|"the question is to settle what is Caesar’s, what belongs to the secular"|FALSE
39064|"authority: and it is sufficiently notorious that the secular no less than"|FALSE
39064|"the ecclesiastical authority have claimed almost everything as their own."|FALSE
39064|"The divine spirit must interpenetrate the entire secular life: whereby"|FALSE
39064|"wisdom is concrete within it, and it carries the terms of its own"|FALSE
39064|"justification. But that concrete indwelling is only the aforesaid ethical"|FALSE
39064|"organisations. It is the morality of marriage as against the sanctity of a"|FALSE
39064|"celibate order;—the morality of economic and industrial action against the"|FALSE
39064|"sanctity of poverty and its indolence;—the morality of an obedience"|FALSE
39064|"dedicated to the law of the state as against the sanctity of an obedience"|FALSE
39064|"from which law and duty are absent and where conscience is enslaved. With"|FALSE
39064|"the growing need for law and morality and the sense of the spirit’s"|FALSE
39064|"essential liberty, there sets in a conflict of spirit with the religion of"|FALSE
39064|"unfreedom. It is no use to organise political laws and arrangements on"|FALSE
39064|"principles of equity and reason, so long as in religion the principle of"|FALSE
39064|"unfreedom is not abandoned. A free state and a slavish religion are"|FALSE
39064|"incompatible. It is silly to suppose that we may try to allot them"|FALSE
39064|"separate spheres, under the impression that their diverse natures will"|FALSE
39064|"maintain an attitude of tranquillity one to another and not break out in"|FALSE
39064|"contradiction and battle. Principles of civil freedom can be but abstract"|FALSE
39064|"and superficial, and political institutions deduced from them must be, if"|FALSE
39064|"taken alone, untenable, so long as those principles in their wisdom"|FALSE
39064|"mistake religion so much as not to know that the maxims of the reason in"|FALSE
39064|"actuality have their last and supreme sanction in the religious conscience"|FALSE
39064|"in subsumption under the consciousness of “absolute” truth. Let us suppose"|FALSE
39064|"even that, no matter how, a code of law should arise, so to speak _a"|FALSE
39064|"priori_, founded on principles of reason, but in contradiction with an"|FALSE
39064|"established religion based on principles of spiritual unfreedom; still, as"|FALSE
39064|"the duty of carrying out the laws lies in the hands of individual members"|FALSE
39064|"of the government, and of the various classes of the administrative"|FALSE
39064|"_personnel_, it is vain to delude ourselves with the abstract and empty"|FALSE

39064|"consciousness of the absolute Idea should be first reached and apprehended"|FALSE
39064|"in this form: in other words, it must exist in its immediate reality as"|FALSE
39064|"religion, earlier than it does as philosophy. Philosophy is a later"|FALSE
39064|"development from this basis (just as Greek philosophy itself is later than"|FALSE

39064|"intelligence. His state is therefore, on its own showing, wanting in"|FALSE
39064|"subjective liberty (§ 503 note, § 513, &c.). The truth which should be"|FALSE
39064|"immanent in the state, should knit it together and control it, he, for"|FALSE

39064|"neither the state nor the race of men can be liberated from evils,—so long"|FALSE
39064|"will the idea of the political constitution fall short of possibility and"|FALSE

39064|"of the state,—the idea of the substantial moral life, with which is"|FALSE
39064|"identical the liberty of an independent self-consciousness. Only in the"|FALSE
39064|"principle of mind, which is aware of its own essence, is implicitly in"|FALSE

39064|"accomplishing the reconciliation of actuality in general with the mind, of"|FALSE
39064|"the state with the religious conscience as well as with the philosophical"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness. Self-realising subjectivity is in this case absolutely"|FALSE
39064|"identical with substantial universality. Hence religion as such, and the"|FALSE
39064|"state as such,—both as forms in which the principle exists—each contain"|FALSE
39064|"the absolute truth: so that the truth, in its philosophic phase, is after"|FALSE
39064|"all only in one of its forms. But even religion, as it grows and expands,"|FALSE
39064|"lets other aspects of the Idea of humanity grow and expand also (§ 500"|FALSE
39064|"sqq.). As it is left therefore behind, in its first immediate, and so also"|FALSE
39064|"one-sided phase, Religion may, or rather _must_, appear in its existence"|FALSE
39064|"degraded to sensuous externality, and thus in the sequel become an"|FALSE
39064|"influence to oppress liberty of spirit and to deprave political life."|FALSE
39064|"Still the principle has in it the infinite “elasticity” of the “absolute”"|FALSE
39064|"form, so as to overcome this depraving of the form-determination (and of"|FALSE
39064|"the content by these means), and to bring about the reconciliation of the"|FALSE
39064|"spirit in itself. Thus ultimately, in the Protestant conscience the"|FALSE
39064|"principles of the religious and of the ethical conscience come to be one"|FALSE
39064|"and the same: the free spirit learning to see itself in its reasonableness"|FALSE
39064|"and truth. In the Protestant state, the constitution and the code, as well"|FALSE
39064|"as their several applications, embody the principle and the development of"|FALSE
39064|"the moral life, which proceeds and can only proceed from the truth of"|FALSE
39064|"religion, when reinstated in its original principle and in that way as"|FALSE
39064|"such first become actual. The moral life of the state and the religious"|FALSE

39064|"§ 553. The _notion_ of mind has its _reality_ in the mind. If this reality"|FALSE
39064|"in identity with that notion is to exist as the consciousness of the"|FALSE

39064|"knowledge, but rather to a sort of knowledge, and that belief is only a"|FALSE
39064|"particular form of the latter, has been remarked already (§ 63 note). If"|FALSE
39064|"nowadays there is so little consciousness of God, and his objective"|FALSE
39064|"essence is so little dwelt upon, while people speak so much more of the"|FALSE
39064|"subjective side of religion, i.e. of God’s indwelling in us, and if that"|FALSE
39064|"and not the truth as such is called for,—in this there is at least the"|FALSE

39064|"Sub-Section A. Art."|FALSE
39064|"§ 556. As this consciousness of the Absolute first takes shape, its"|FALSE
39064|"immediacy produces the factor of finitude in Art. On one hand that is, it"|FALSE
39064|"breaks up into a work of external common existence, into the subject which"|FALSE
39064|"produces that work, and the subject which contemplates and worships it."|FALSE
39064|"But, on the other hand, it is the concrete _contemplation_ and mental"|FALSE

39064|"the concrete shape born of the subjective spirit, its natural immediacy,"|FALSE
39064|"which is only a _sign_ of the Idea, is so transfigured by the informing"|FALSE
39064|"spirit in order to express the Idea, that the figure shows it and it"|FALSE
39064|"alone:—the shape or form of _Beauty_."|FALSE
39064|"§ 557. The sensuous externality attaching to the beautiful,—the _form of"|FALSE
39064|"immediacy_ as such,—at the same time _qualifies_ what it _embodies_: and"|FALSE
39064|"the God (of art) has with his spirituality at the same time the stamp upon"|FALSE
39064|"him of a natural medium or natural phase of existence—He contains the"|FALSE
39064|"so-called _unity_ of nature and spirit—i.e. the immediate unity in"|FALSE
39064|"sensuously intuitional form—hence not the spiritual unity, in which the"|FALSE
39064|"natural would be put only as “ideal,” as superseded in spirit, and the"|FALSE
39064|"spiritual content would be only in self-relation. It is not the absolute"|FALSE
39064|"spirit which enters this consciousness. On the subjective side the"|FALSE
39064|"community has of course an ethical life, aware, as it is, of the"|FALSE
39064|"spirituality of its essence: and its self-consciousness and actuality are"|FALSE
39064|"in it elevated to substantial liberty. But with the stigma of immediacy"|FALSE
39064|"upon it, the subject’s liberty is only a _manner of life_, without the"|FALSE
39064|"infinite self-reflection and the subjective inwardness of _conscience_."|FALSE
39064|"These considerations govern in their further developments the devotion and"|FALSE
39064|"the worship in the religion of fine art."|FALSE
39064|"§ 558. For the objects of contemplation it has to produce, Art requires"|FALSE
39064|"not only an external given material—(under which are also included"|FALSE
39064|"subjective images and ideas), but—for the expression of spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"truth—must use the given forms of nature with a significance which art"|FALSE
39064|"must divine and possess (cf. § 411). Of all such forms the human is the"|FALSE
39064|"highest and the true, because only in it can the spirit have its"|FALSE
39064|"corporeity and thus its visible expression."|FALSE
39064|"This disposes of the principle of the _imitation of nature_ in art: a"|FALSE
39064|"point on which it is impossible to come to an understanding while a"|FALSE
39064|"distinction is left thus abstract,—in other words, so long as the natural"|FALSE
39064|"is only taken in its externality, not as the “characteristic” meaningful"|FALSE

39064|"detail, breaks up into an indeterminate polytheism. With the essential"|FALSE
39064|"restrictedness of its content, Beauty in general goes no further than a"|FALSE
39064|"penetration of the vision or image by the spiritual principle,—something"|FALSE
39064|"formal, so that the thought embodied, or the idea, can, like the material"|FALSE
39064|"which it uses to work in, be of the most diverse and unessential kind, and"|FALSE

39064|"the opposite one-sidedness (§ 556) that it is something _made_ by the"|FALSE
39064|"artist. The subject or agent is the mere technical activity: and the work"|FALSE
39064|"of art is only then an expression of the God, when there is no sign of"|FALSE
39064|"subjective particularity in it, and the net power of the indwelling spirit"|FALSE
39064|"is conceived and born into the world, without admixture and unspotted from"|FALSE
39064|"its contingency. But as liberty only goes as far as there is thought, the"|FALSE
39064|"action inspired with the fullness of this indwelling power, the artist’s"|FALSE
39064|"_enthusiasm_, is like a foreign force under which he is bound and passive;"|FALSE
39064|"the artistic _production_ has on its part the form of natural immediacy,"|FALSE
39064|"it belongs to the _genius_ or particular endowment of the artist,—and is"|FALSE
39064|"at the same time a labour concerned with technical cleverness and"|FALSE
39064|"mechanical externalities. The work of art therefore is just as much a work"|FALSE
39064|"due to free option, and the artist is the master of the God."|FALSE
39064|"§ 561. In work so inspired the reconciliation appears so obvious in its"|FALSE
39064|"initial stage that it is without more ado accomplished in the subjective"|FALSE
39064|"self-consciousness, which is thus self-confident and of good cheer,"|FALSE
39064|"without the depth and without the sense of its antithesis to the absolute"|FALSE
39064|"essence. On the further side of the perfection (which is reached in such"|FALSE
39064|"reconciliation, in the beauty of _classical art_) lies the art of"|FALSE
39064|"sublimity,—_symbolic art_, in which the figuration suitable to the Idea is"|FALSE
39064|"not yet found, and the thought as going forth and wrestling with the"|FALSE
39064|"figure is exhibited as a negative attitude to it, and yet all the while"|FALSE
39064|"toiling to work itself into it. The meaning or theme thus shows it has not"|FALSE
39064|"yet reached the infinite form, is not yet known, not yet conscious of"|FALSE
39064|"itself, as free spirit. The artist’s theme only is as the abstract God of"|FALSE
39064|"pure thought, or an effort towards him,—a restless and unappeased effort"|FALSE
39064|"which throws itself into shape after shape as it vainly tries to find its"|FALSE
39064|"goal."|FALSE
39064|"§ 562. In another way the Idea and the sensuous figure it appears in are"|FALSE
39064|"incompatible; and that is where the infinite form, subjectivity, is not as"|FALSE
39064|"in the first extreme a mere superficial personality, but its inmost depth,"|FALSE
39064|"and God is known not as only seeking his form or satisfying himself in an"|FALSE
39064|"external form, but as only finding himself in himself, and thus giving"|FALSE
39064|"himself his adequate figure in the spiritual world alone. _Romantic art_"|FALSE
39064|"gives up the task of showing him as such in external form and by means of"|FALSE
39064|"beauty: it presents him as only condescending to appearance, and the"|FALSE
39064|"divine as the heart of hearts in an externality from which it always"|FALSE
39064|"disengages itself. Thus the external can here appear as contingent towards"|FALSE
39064|"its significance."|FALSE
39064|"The Philosophy of Religion has to discover the logical necessity in the"|FALSE
39064|"progress by which the Being, known as the Absolute, assumes fuller and"|FALSE

39064|"nature of a nation’s moral life, the principle of its law, of its actual"|FALSE
39064|"liberty, and of its constitution, as well as of its art and science,"|FALSE
39064|"corresponds to the principle which constitutes the substance of a"|FALSE
39064|"religion. That all these elements of a nation’s actuality constitute one"|FALSE
39064|"systematic totality, that one spirit creates and informs them, is a truth"|FALSE
39064|"on which follows the further truth that the history of religions coincides"|FALSE
39064|"with the world-history."|FALSE
39064|"As regards the close connexion of art with the various religions it may be"|FALSE
39064|"specially noted that _beautiful_ art can only belong to those religions in"|FALSE
39064|"which the spiritual principle, though concrete and intrinsically free, is"|FALSE
39064|"not yet absolute. In religions where the Idea has not yet been revealed"|FALSE
39064|"and known in its free character, though the craving for art is felt in"|FALSE
39064|"order to bring in imaginative visibility to consciousness the idea of the"|FALSE
39064|"supreme being, and though art is the sole organ in which the abstract and"|FALSE
39064|"radically indistinct content,—a mixture from natural and spiritual"|FALSE
39064|"sources,—can try to bring itself to consciousness;—still this art is"|FALSE
39064|"defective; its form is defective because its subject-matter and theme is"|FALSE
39064|"so,—for the defect in subject-matter comes from the form not being"|FALSE
39064|"immanent in it. The representations of this symbolic art keep a certain"|FALSE
39064|"tastelessness and stolidity—for the principle it embodies is itself stolid"|FALSE
39064|"and dull, and hence has not the power freely to transmute the external to"|FALSE
39064|"significance and shape. Beautiful art, on the contrary, has for its"|FALSE
39064|"condition the self-consciousness of the free spirit,—the consciousness"|FALSE
39064|"that compared with it the natural and sensuous has no standing of its own:"|FALSE
39064|"it makes the natural wholly into the mere expression of spirit, which is"|FALSE
39064|"thus the inner form that gives utterance to itself alone."|FALSE
39064|"But with a further and deeper study, we see that the advent of art, in a"|FALSE
39064|"religion still in the bonds of sensuous externality, shows that such"|FALSE
39064|"religion is on the decline. At the very time it seems to give religion the"|FALSE
39064|"supreme glorification, expression and brilliancy, it has lifted the"|FALSE
39064|"religion away over its limitation. In the sublime divinity to which the"|FALSE
39064|"work of art succeeds in giving expression the artistic genius and the"|FALSE
39064|"spectator find themselves at home, with their personal sense and feeling,"|FALSE
39064|"satisfied and liberated: to them the vision and the consciousness of free"|FALSE
39064|"spirit has been vouchsafed and attained. Beautiful art, from its side, has"|FALSE
39064|"thus performed the same service as philosophy: it has purified the spirit"|FALSE
39064|"from its thraldom. The older religion in which the need of fine art, and"|FALSE
39064|"just for that reason, is first generated, looks up in its principle to an"|FALSE
39064|"other-world which is sensuous and unmeaning: the images adored by its"|FALSE
39064|"devotees are hideous idols regarded as wonder-working talismans, which"|FALSE
39064|"point to the unspiritual objectivity of that other world,—and bones"|FALSE
39064|"perform a similar or even a better service than such images. But even fine"|FALSE
39064|"art is only a grade of liberation, not the supreme liberation itself.—The"|FALSE
39064|"genuine objectivity, which is only in the medium of thought,—the medium in"|FALSE
39064|"which alone the pure spirit is for the spirit, and where the liberation is"|FALSE
39064|"accompanied with reverence,—is still absent in the sensuous beauty of the"|FALSE
39064|"work of art, still more in that external, unbeautiful sensuousness."|FALSE

39064|"are cognised as necessary, and this necessary as free."|FALSE

39064|"necessity in the content of the absolute picture-idea, as also of the"|FALSE
39064|"necessity in the two forms—on one hand, immediate vision and its poetry,"|FALSE
39064|"and the objective and external revelation presupposed by"|FALSE

39064|"forms, elevation of them into the absolute form, which determines itself"|FALSE
39064|"to content, remains identical with it, and is in that the cognition of"|FALSE
39064|"that essential and actual necessity. This movement, which philosophy is,"|FALSE
39064|"finds itself already accomplished, when at the close it seizes its own"|FALSE
39064|"notion,—i.e. only _looks back_ on its knowledge."|FALSE
39064|"Here might seem to be the place to treat in a definite exposition of the"|FALSE
39064|"reciprocal relations of philosophy and religion. The whole question turns"|FALSE
39064|"entirely on the difference of the forms of speculative thought from the"|FALSE
39064|"forms of mental representation and “reflecting” intellect. But it is the"|FALSE
39064|"whole cycle of philosophy, and of logic in particular, which has not"|FALSE
39064|"merely taught and made known this difference, but also criticised it, or"|FALSE
39064|"rather has let its nature develop and judge itself by these very"|FALSE
39064|"categories. It is only by an insight into the value of these forms that"|FALSE
39064|"the true and needful conviction can be gained, that the content of"|FALSE
39064|"religion and philosophy is the same,—leaving out, of course, the further"|FALSE
39064|"details of external nature and finite mind which fall outside the range of"|FALSE
39064|"religion. But religion is the truth _for all men_: faith rests on the"|FALSE
39064|"witness of the spirit, which as witnessing is the spirit in man. This"|FALSE
39064|"witness—the underlying essence in all humanity—takes, when driven to"|FALSE
39064|"expound itself, its first definite form under those acquired habits of"|FALSE
39064|"thought which his secular consciousness and intellect otherwise employs."|FALSE
39064|"In this way the truth becomes liable to the terms and conditions of"|FALSE
39064|"finitude in general. This does not prevent the spirit, even in employing"|FALSE
39064|"sensuous ideas and finite categories of thought, from retaining its"|FALSE
39064|"content (which as religion is essentially speculative,) with a tenacity"|FALSE
39064|"which does violence to them, and acts _inconsistently_ towards them. By"|FALSE
39064|"this inconsistency it corrects their defects. Nothing easier therefore for"|FALSE
39064|"the “Rationalist” than to point out contradictions in the exposition of"|FALSE
39064|"the faith, and then to prepare triumphs for its principle of formal"|FALSE
39064|"identity. If the spirit yields to this finite reflection, which has"|FALSE
39064|"usurped the title of reason and philosophy—(“Rationalism”)—it strips"|FALSE
39064|"religious truth of its infinity and makes it in reality nought. Religion"|FALSE
39064|"in that case is completely in the right in guarding herself against such"|FALSE
39064|"reason and philosophy and treating them as enemies. But it is another"|FALSE
39064|"thing when religion sets herself against comprehending reason, and against"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy in general, and specially against a philosophy of which the"|FALSE
39064|"doctrine is speculative, and so religious. Such an opposition proceeds"|FALSE
39064|"from failure to appreciate the difference indicated and the value of"|FALSE
39064|"spiritual form in general, and particularly of the logical form; or, to be"|FALSE
39064|"more precise, still from failure to note the distinction of the"|FALSE
39064|"content—which may be in both the same—from these forms. It is on the"|FALSE
39064|"ground of form that philosophy has been reproached and accused by the"|FALSE
39064|"religious party; just as conversely its speculative content has brought"|FALSE
39064|"the same charges upon it from a self-styled philosophy—and from a pithless"|FALSE
39064|"orthodoxy. It had too little of God in it for the former; too much for the"|FALSE
39064|"latter."|FALSE
39064|"The charge of _Atheism_, which used often to be brought against philosophy"|FALSE
39064|"(that it has _too little_ of God), has grown rare: the more wide-spread"|FALSE
39064|"grows the charge of Pantheism, that it has _too much_ of him:—so much so,"|FALSE
39064|"that it is treated not so much as an imputation, but as a proved fact, or"|FALSE
39064|"a sheer fact which needs no proof. Piety, in particular, which with its"|FALSE
39064|"pious airs of superiority fancies itself free to dispense with proof, goes"|FALSE
39064|"hand in hand with empty rationalism—(which means to be so much opposed to"|FALSE
39064|"it, though both repose really on the same habit of mind)—in the wanton"|FALSE
39064|"assertion, almost as if it merely mentioned a notorious fact, that"|FALSE
39064|"Philosophy is the All-one doctrine, or Pantheism. It must be said that it"|FALSE
39064|"was more to the credit of piety and theology when they accused a"|FALSE
39064|"philosophical system (e.g. Spinozism) of Atheism than of Pantheism, though"|FALSE
39064|"the former imputation at the first glance looks more cruel and insidious"|FALSE
39064|"(cf. § 71 note). The imputation of Atheism presupposes a definite idea of"|FALSE
39064|"a full and real God, and arises because the popular idea does not detect"|FALSE
39064|"in the philosophical notion the peculiar form to which it is attached."|FALSE
39064|"Philosophy indeed can recognise its own forms in the categories of"|FALSE
39064|"religious consciousness, and even its own teaching in the doctrine of"|FALSE
39064|"religion—which therefore it does not disparage. But the converse is not"|FALSE
39064|"true: the religious consciousness does not apply the criticism of thought"|FALSE
39064|"to itself, does not comprehend itself, and is therefore, as it stands,"|FALSE
39064|"exclusive. To impute Pantheism instead of Atheism to Philosophy is part of"|FALSE
39064|"the modern habit of mind—of the new piety and new theology. For them"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy has too much of God:—so much so, that, if we believe them, it"|FALSE
39064|"asserts that God is everything and everything is God. This new theology,"|FALSE
39064|"which makes religion only a subjective feeling and denies the knowledge of"|FALSE
39064|"the divine nature, thus retains nothing more than a God in general without"|FALSE
39064|"objective characteristics. Without interest of its own for the concrete,"|FALSE
39064|"fulfilled notion of God, it treats it only as an interest which _others_"|FALSE
39064|"once had, and hence treats what belongs to the doctrine of God’s concrete"|FALSE
39064|"nature as something merely historical. The indeterminate God is to be"|FALSE
39064|"found in all religions; every kind of piety (§ 72)—that of the Hindoo to"|FALSE
39064|"asses, cows,—or to dalai-lamas,—that of the Egyptians to the ox—is always"|FALSE
39064|"adoration of an object which, with all its absurdities, also contains the"|FALSE
39064|"generic abstract, God in General. If this theory needs no more than such a"|FALSE
39064|"God, so as to find God in everything called religion, it must at least"|FALSE
39064|"find such a God recognised even in philosophy, and can no longer accuse it"|FALSE
39064|"of Atheism. The mitigation of the reproach of Atheism into that of"|FALSE
39064|"Pantheism has its ground therefore in the superficial idea to which this"|FALSE
39064|"mildness has attenuated and emptied God. As that popular idea clings to"|FALSE
39064|"its abstract universality, from which all definite quality is excluded,"|FALSE
39064|"all such definiteness is only the non-divine, the secularity of things,"|FALSE
39064|"thus left standing in fixed undisturbed substantiality. On such a"|FALSE
39064|"presupposition, even after philosophy has maintained God’s absolute"|FALSE
39064|"universality, and the consequent untruth of the being of external things,"|FALSE
39064|"the hearer clings as he did before to his belief that secular things still"|FALSE
39064|"keep their being, and form all that is definite in the divine"|FALSE
39064|"universality. He thus changes that universality into what he calls the"|FALSE
39064|"pantheistic:—_Everything is_—(empirical things, without distinction,"|FALSE
39064|"whether higher or lower in the scale, _are_)—all possess substantiality;"|FALSE
39064|"and so—thus he understands philosophy—each and every secular thing is God."|FALSE
39064|"It is only his own stupidity, and the falsifications due to such"|FALSE
39064|"misconception, which generate the imagination and the allegation of such"|FALSE
39064|"pantheism."|FALSE
39064|"But if those who give out that a certain philosophy is Pantheism, are"|FALSE
39064|"unable and unwilling to see this—for it is just to see the notion that"|FALSE
39064|"they refuse—they should before everything have verified the alleged fact"|FALSE
39064|"that _any one philosopher, or any one man_, had really ascribed"|FALSE
39064|"substantial or objective and inherent reality to _all_ things and regarded"|FALSE
39064|"them as God:—that such an idea had ever come into the hand of any body but"|FALSE
39064|"themselves. This allegation I will further elucidate in this exoteric"|FALSE
39064|"discussion: and the only way to do so is to set down the evidence. If we"|FALSE
39064|"want to take so-called Pantheism in its most poetical, most sublime, or if"|FALSE
39064|"you will, its grossest shape, we must, as is well known, consult the"|FALSE
39064|"oriental poets: and the most copious delineations of it are found in"|FALSE
39064|"Hindoo literature. Amongst the abundant resources open to our disposal on"|FALSE
39064|"this topic, I select—as the most authentic statement accessible—the"|FALSE
39064|"Bhagavat-Gita, and amongst its effusions, prolix and reiterative _ad"|FALSE
39064|"nauseam_, some of the most telling passages. In the 10th Lesson (in"|FALSE
39064|"Schlegel, p. 162) Krishna says of himself(173):—“I am the self, seated in"|FALSE
39064|"the hearts of all beings. I am the beginning and the middle and the end"|FALSE
39064|"also of all beings ... I am the beaming sun amongst the shining ones, and"|FALSE
39064|"the moon among the lunar mansions.... Amongst the Vedas I am the"|FALSE
39064|"Sâma-Veda: I am mind amongst the senses: I am consciousness in living"|FALSE
39064|"beings. And I am Sankara (Siva) among the Rudras, ... Meru among the"|FALSE
39064|"high-topped mountains, ... the Himalaya among the firmly-fixed"|FALSE
39064|"(mountains).... Among beasts I am the lord of beasts.... Among letters I"|FALSE
39064|"am the letter A.... I am the spring among the seasons.... I am also that"|FALSE
39064|"which is the seed of all things: there is nothing moveable or immoveable"|FALSE
39064|"which can exist without me.”"|FALSE
39064|"Even in these totally sensuous delineations, Krishna (and we must not"|FALSE
39064|"suppose there is, besides Krishna, still God, or a God besides; as he said"|FALSE
39064|"before he was Siva, or Indra, so it is afterwards said that Brahma too is"|FALSE
39064|"in him) makes himself out to be—not everything, but only—the most"|FALSE
39064|"excellent of everything. Everywhere there is a distinction drawn between"|FALSE
39064|"external, unessential existences, and one essential amongst them, which he"|FALSE
39064|"is. Even when, at the beginning of the passage, he is said to be the"|FALSE
39064|"beginning, middle, and end of living things, this totality is"|FALSE
39064|"distinguished from the living things themselves as single existences. Even"|FALSE
39064|"such a picture which extends deity far and wide in its existence cannot be"|FALSE
39064|"called pantheism: we must rather say that in the infinitely multiple"|FALSE
39064|"empirical world, everything is reduced to a limited number of essential"|FALSE
39064|"existences, to a polytheism. But even what has been quoted shows that"|FALSE
39064|"these very substantialities of the externally-existent do not retain the"|FALSE
39064|"independence entitling them to be named Gods; even Siva, Indra, &c. melt"|FALSE
39064|"into the one Krishna."|FALSE
39064|"This reduction is more expressly made in the following scene (7th Lesson,"|FALSE
39064|"p. 7 sqq.). Krishna says: “I am the producer and the destroyer of the"|FALSE
39064|"whole universe. There is nothing else higher than myself; all this is"|FALSE
39064|"woven upon me, like numbers of pearls upon a thread. I am the taste in"|FALSE
39064|"water;... I am the light of the sun and the moon; I am ‘Om’ in all the"|FALSE
39064|"Vedas.... I am life in all beings.... I am the discernment of the"|FALSE
39064|"discerning ones.... I am also the strength of the strong.” Then he adds:"|FALSE
39064|"“The whole universe deluded by these three states of mind developed from"|FALSE
39064|"the qualities [sc. goodness, passion, darkness] does not know me who am"|FALSE
39064|"beyond them and inexhaustible: for this delusion of mine,” [even the Maya"|FALSE
39064|"is _his_, nothing independent], “developed from the qualities is divine"|FALSE
39064|"and difficult to transcend. Those cross beyond this delusion who resort to"|FALSE
39064|"me alone.” Then the picture gathers itself up in a simple expression: “At"|FALSE
39064|"the end of many lives, the man possessed of knowledge approaches me,"|FALSE
39064|"(believing) that Vasudeva is everything. Such a high-souled mind is very"|FALSE
39064|"hard to find. Those who are deprived of knowledge by various desires"|FALSE
39064|"approach other divinities... Whichever form of deity one worships with"|FALSE

39064|"Colebrooke and many others have described the Hindoo religion as at bottom"|FALSE

39064|"which everything is God, and God everything. Hindoo monotheism moreover is"|FALSE
39064|"itself an example how little comes of mere monotheism, if the Idea of God"|FALSE
39064|"is not deeply determinate in itself. For that unity, if it be"|FALSE
39064|"intrinsically abstract and therefore empty, tends of itself to let"|FALSE
39064|"whatever is concrete, outside it—be it as a lot of Gods or as secular,"|FALSE
39064|"empirical individuals—keep its independence. That pantheism indeed—on the"|FALSE
39064|"shallow conception of it—might with a show of logic as well be called a"|FALSE
39064|"monotheism: for if God, as it says, is identical with the world, then as"|FALSE
39064|"there is only one world there would be in that pantheism only one God."|FALSE
39064|"Perhaps the empty numerical unity must be predicated of the world: but"|FALSE
39064|"such abstract predication of it has no further special interest; on the"|FALSE
39064|"contrary, a mere numerical unity just means that its _content_ is an"|FALSE
39064|"infinite multeity and variety of finitudes. But it is that delusion with"|FALSE
39064|"the empty unity, which alone makes possible and induces the wrong idea of"|FALSE
39064|"pantheism. It is only the picture—floating in the indefinite blue—of the"|FALSE
39064|"world as _one thing_, _the all_, that could ever be considered capable of"|FALSE
39064|"combining with God: only on that assumption could philosophy be supposed"|FALSE
39064|"to teach that God is the world: for if the world were taken as it is, as"|FALSE

39064|"hardly have been even held possible to suppose a pantheism which asserted"|FALSE

39064|"But to go back again to the question of fact. If we want to see the"|FALSE
39064|"consciousness of the One—not as with the Hindoos split between the"|FALSE
39064|"featureless unity of abstract thought, on one hand, and on the other, the"|FALSE
39064|"long-winded weary story of its particular detail, but—in its finest purity"|FALSE
39064|"and sublimity, we must consult the Mohammedans. If e.g. in the excellent"|FALSE
39064|"Jelaleddin-Rumi in particular, we find the unity of the soul with the One"|FALSE
39064|"set forth, and that unity described as love, this spiritual unity is an"|FALSE
39064|"exaltation above the finite and vulgar, a transfiguration of the natural"|FALSE
39064|"and the spiritual, in which the externalism and transitoriness of"|FALSE
39064|"immediate nature, and of empirical secular spirit, is discarded and"|FALSE
39064|"absorbed(174)."|FALSE
39064|"I refrain from accumulating further examples of the religious and poetic"|FALSE
39064|"conceptions which it is customary to call pantheistic. Of the philosophies"|FALSE
39064|"to which that name is given, the Eleatic, or Spinozist, it has been"|FALSE
39064|"remarked earlier (§ 50, note) that so far are they from identifying God"|FALSE
39064|"with the world and making him finite, that in these systems this"|FALSE
39064|"“everything” has no truth, and that we should rather call them"|FALSE
39064|"monotheistic, or, in relation to the popular idea of the world, acosmical."|FALSE
39064|"They are most accurately called systems which apprehend the Absolute only"|FALSE
39064|"as substance. Of the oriental, especially the Mohammedan, modes of"|FALSE
39064|"envisaging God, we may rather say that they represent the Absolute as the"|FALSE
39064|"utterly universal genus which dwells in the species or existences, but"|FALSE
39064|"dwells so potently that these existences have no actual reality. The fault"|FALSE
39064|"of all these modes of thought and systems is that they stop short of"|FALSE
39064|"defining substance as subject and as mind."|FALSE
39064|"These systems and modes of pictorial conception originate from the one"|FALSE
39064|"need common to all philosophies and all religions of getting an idea of"|FALSE
39064|"God, and, secondly, of the relationship of God and the world. (In"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy it is specially made out that the determination of God’s nature"|FALSE
39064|"determines his relations with the world.) The “reflective” understanding"|FALSE
39064|"begins by rejecting all systems and modes of conception, which, whether"|FALSE
39064|"they spring from heart, imagination or speculation, express the"|FALSE
39064|"interconnexion of God and the world: and in order to have God pure in"|FALSE
39064|"faith or consciousness, he is as essence parted from appearance, as"|FALSE
39064|"infinite from the finite. But, after this partition, the conviction arises"|FALSE
39064|"also that the appearance has a relation to the essence, the finite to the"|FALSE
39064|"infinite, and so on: and thus arises the question of reflection as to the"|FALSE
39064|"nature of this relation. It is in the reflective form that the whole"|FALSE
39064|"difficulty of the affair lies, and that causes this relation to be called"|FALSE
39064|"incomprehensible by the agnostic. The close of philosophy is not the"|FALSE
39064|"place, even in a general exoteric discussion, to waste a word on what a"|FALSE
39064|"“notion” means. But as the view taken of this relation is closely"|FALSE
39064|"connected with the view taken of philosophy generally and with all"|FALSE
39064|"imputations against it, we may still add the remark that though philosophy"|FALSE
39064|"certainly has to do with unity in general, it is not however with abstract"|FALSE
39064|"unity, mere identity, and the empty absolute, but with concrete unity (the"|FALSE
39064|"notion), and that in its whole course it has to do with nothing else;—that"|FALSE
39064|"each step in its advance is a peculiar term or phase of this concrete"|FALSE
39064|"unity, and that the deepest and last expression of unity is the unity of"|FALSE
39064|"absolute mind itself. Would-be judges and critics of philosophy might be"|FALSE
39064|"recommended to familiarise themselves with these phases of unity and to"|FALSE
39064|"take the trouble to get acquainted with them, at least to know so much"|FALSE
39064|"that of these terms there are a great many, and that amongst them there is"|FALSE
39064|"great variety. But they show so little acquaintance with them—and still"|FALSE
39064|"less take trouble about it—that, when they hear of unity—and relation"|FALSE
39064|"_ipso facto_ implies unity—they rather stick fast at quite abstract"|FALSE
39064|"indeterminate unity, and lose sight of the chief point of interest—the"|FALSE
39064|"special mode in which the unity is qualified. Hence all they can say about"|FALSE
39064|"philosophy is that dry identity is its principle and result, and that it"|FALSE
39064|"is the system of identity. Sticking fast to the undigested thought of"|FALSE
39064|"identity, they have laid hands on, not the concrete unity, the notion and"|FALSE
39064|"content of philosophy, but rather its reverse. In the philosophical field"|FALSE
39064|"they proceed, as in the physical field the physicist; who also is well"|FALSE
39064|"aware that he has before him a variety of sensuous properties and"|FALSE
39064|"matters—or usually matters alone, (for the properties get transformed into"|FALSE
39064|"matters also for the physicist)—and that these matters (elements) _also_"|FALSE
39064|"stand in _relation_ to one another. But the question is, Of what kind is"|FALSE
39064|"this relation? Every peculiarity and the whole difference of natural"|FALSE
39064|"things, inorganic and living, depend solely on the different modes of this"|FALSE
39064|"unity. But instead of ascertaining these different modes, the ordinary"|FALSE
39064|"physicist (chemist included) takes up only one, the most external and the"|FALSE
39064|"worst, viz. _composition_, applies only it in the whole range of natural"|FALSE
39064|"structures, which he thus renders for ever inexplicable."|FALSE
39064|"The aforesaid shallow pantheism is an equally obvious inference from this"|FALSE
39064|"shallow identity. All that those who employ this invention of their own to"|FALSE
39064|"accuse philosophy gather from the study of God’s _relation_ to the world"|FALSE
39064|"is that the one, but only the one factor of this category of relation—and"|FALSE
39064|"that the factor of indeterminateness—is identity. Thereupon they stick"|FALSE
39064|"fast in this half-perception, and assert—falsely as a fact—that philosophy"|FALSE
39064|"teaches the identity of God and the world. And as in their judgment either"|FALSE
39064|"of the two,—the world as much as God—has the same solid substantiality as"|FALSE
39064|"the other, they infer that in the philosophic Idea God is _composed_ of"|FALSE
39064|"God and the world. Such then is the idea they form of pantheism, and which"|FALSE
39064|"they ascribe to philosophy. Unaccustomed in their own thinking and"|FALSE
39064|"apprehending of thoughts to go beyond such categories, they import them"|FALSE
39064|"into philosophy, where they are utterly unknown; they thus infect it with"|FALSE
39064|"the disease against which they subsequently raise an outcry. If any"|FALSE
39064|"difficulty emerge in comprehending God’s relation to the world, they at"|FALSE
39064|"once and very easily escape it by admitting that this relation contains"|FALSE
39064|"for them an inexplicable contradiction; and that hence, they must stop at"|FALSE
39064|"the vague conception of such relation, perhaps under the more familiar"|FALSE
39064|"names of, e.g. omnipresence, providence, &c. Faith in their use of the"|FALSE
39064|"term means no more than a refusal to define the conception, or to enter on"|FALSE
39064|"a closer discussion of the problem. That men and classes of untrained"|FALSE
39064|"intellect are satisfied with such indefiniteness, is what one expects; but"|FALSE
39064|"when a trained intellect and an interest for reflective study is"|FALSE
39064|"satisfied, in matters admitted to be of superior, if not even of supreme"|FALSE
39064|"interest, with indefinite ideas, it is hard to decide whether the thinker"|FALSE
39064|"is really in earnest with the subject. But if those who cling to this"|FALSE
39064|"crude “rationalism” were in earnest, e.g. with God’s omnipresence, so far"|FALSE
39064|"as to realise their faith thereon in a definite mental idea, in what"|FALSE
39064|"difficulties would they be involved by their belief in the true reality of"|FALSE
39064|"the things of sense! They would hardly like, as Epicurus does, to let God"|FALSE
39064|"dwell in the interspaces of things, i.e. in the pores of the"|FALSE
39064|"physicists,—said pores being the negative, something supposed to exist"|FALSE
39064|"_beside_ the material reality. This very “Beside” would give their"|FALSE
39064|"pantheism its spatiality,—their everything, conceived as the mutual"|FALSE
39064|"exclusion of parts in space. But in ascribing to God, in his relation to"|FALSE
39064|"the world, an action on and in the space thus filled on the world and in"|FALSE
39064|"it, they would endlessly split up the divine actuality into infinite"|FALSE
39064|"materiality. They would really thus have the misconception they call"|FALSE
39064|"pantheism or all-one-doctrine, only as the necessary sequel of their"|FALSE
39064|"misconceptions of God and the world. But to put that sort of thing, this"|FALSE
39064|"stale gossip of oneness or identity, on the shoulders of philosophy, shows"|FALSE
39064|"such recklessness about justice and truth that it can only be explained"|FALSE
39064|"through the difficulty of getting into the head thoughts and notions, i.e."|FALSE
39064|"not abstract unity, but the many-shaped modes specified. If statements as"|FALSE
39064|"to facts are put forward, and the facts in question are thoughts and"|FALSE
39064|"notions, it is indispensable to get hold of their meaning. But even the"|FALSE
39064|"fulfilment of this requirement has been rendered superfluous, now that it"|FALSE
39064|"has long been a foregone conclusion that philosophy is pantheism, a system"|FALSE
39064|"of identity, an All-one doctrine, and that the person therefore who might"|FALSE
39064|"be unaware of this fact is treated either as merely unaware of a matter of"|FALSE
39064|"common notoriety, or as prevaricating for a purpose. On account of this"|FALSE
39064|"chorus of assertions, then, I have believed myself obliged to speak at"|FALSE
39064|"more length and exoterically on the outward and inward untruth of this"|FALSE
39064|"alleged fact: for exoteric discussion is the only method available in"|FALSE
39064|"dealing with the external apprehension of notions as mere facts,—by which"|FALSE
39064|"notions are perverted into their opposite. The esoteric study of God and"|FALSE
39064|"identity, as of cognitions and notions, is philosophy itself."|FALSE
39064|"§ 574. This notion of philosophy is the self-thinking Idea, the truth"|FALSE
39064|"aware of itself (§ 236),—the logical system, but with the signification"|FALSE
39064|"that it is universality approved and certified in concrete content as in"|FALSE
39064|"its actuality. In this way the science has gone back to its beginning: its"|FALSE
39064|"result is the logical system but as a spiritual principle: out of the"|FALSE
39064|"presupposing judgment, in which the notion was only implicit and the"|FALSE
39064|"beginning an immediate,—and thus out of the _appearance_ which it had"|FALSE
39064|"there—it has risen into its pure principle and thus also into its proper"|FALSE
39064|"medium."|FALSE
39064|"§ 575. It is this appearing which originally gives the motive of the"|FALSE
39064|"further development. The first appearance is formed by the syllogism,"|FALSE
39064|"which is based on the Logical system as starting-point, with Nature for"|FALSE
39064|"the middle term which couples the Mind with it. The Logical principle"|FALSE
39064|"turns to Nature and Nature to Mind. Nature, standing between the Mind and"|FALSE
39064|"its essence, sunders itself, not indeed to extremes of finite abstraction,"|FALSE
39064|"nor itself to something away from them and independent,—which, as other"|FALSE
39064|"than they, only serves as a link between them: for the syllogism is _in"|FALSE
39064|"the Idea_ and Nature is essentially defined as a transition-point and"|FALSE
39064|"negative factor, and as implicitly the Idea. Still the mediation of the"|FALSE
39064|"notion has the external form of _transition_, and the science of Nature"|FALSE
39064|"presents itself as the course of necessity, so that it is only in the one"|FALSE
39064|"extreme that the liberty of the notion is explicit as a self-amalgamation."|FALSE
39064|"§ 576. In the second syllogism this appearance is so far superseded, that"|FALSE
39064|"that syllogism is the standpoint of the Mind itself, which—as the"|FALSE
39064|"mediating agent in the process—presupposes Nature and couples it with the"|FALSE
39064|"Logical principle. It is the syllogism where Mind reflects on itself in"|FALSE
39064|"the Idea: philosophy appears as a subjective cognition, of which liberty"|FALSE
39064|"is the aim, and which is itself the way to produce it."|FALSE
39064|"§ 577. The third syllogism is the Idea of philosophy, which has"|FALSE
39064|"self-knowing reason, the absolutely-universal, for its middle term: a"|FALSE
39064|"middle, which divides itself into Mind and Nature, making the former its"|FALSE
39064|"presupposition, as process of the Idea’s subjective activity, and the"|FALSE
39064|"latter its universal extreme, as process of the objectively and implicitly"|FALSE
39064|"existing Idea. The self-judging of the Idea into its two appearances (§§"|FALSE
39064|"575, 576) characterises both as its (the self-knowing reason’s)"|FALSE
39064|"manifestations: and in it there is a unification of the two aspects:—it is"|FALSE
39064|"the nature of the fact, the notion, which causes the movement and"|FALSE
39064|"development, yet this same movement is equally the action of cognition."|FALSE
