12242|"PREFACE."|FALSE
12242|"The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson"|FALSE
12242|"long since called \"the Poetry of the Portfolio,\"--something produced"|FALSE
12242|"absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of"|FALSE
12242|"expression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitably"|FALSE
12242|"forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism"|FALSE
12242|"and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it"|FALSE
12242|"may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the"|FALSE
12242|"unconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the"|FALSE
12242|"present author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she"|FALSE
12242|"must write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,"|FALSE
12242|"literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the"|FALSE
12242|"doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly"|FALSE
12242|"limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,"|FALSE
12242|"like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with"|FALSE
12242|"great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her"|FALSE
12242|"lifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in great"|FALSE
12242|"abundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all"|FALSE
12242|"conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,"|FALSE
12242|"and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own"|FALSE
12242|"tenacious fastidiousness."|FALSE
12242|"Miss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and died"|FALSE
12242|"there May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was the"|FALSE
12242|"leading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-known"|FALSE
12242|"college there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a large"|FALSE
12242|"reception at his house, attended by all the families connected with"|FALSE
12242|"the institution and by the leading people of the town. On these"|FALSE
12242|"occasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement and"|FALSE
12242|"did her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known from"|FALSE
12242|"her manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence."|FALSE
12242|"The annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,"|FALSE
12242|"and except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as if"|FALSE
12242|"she had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had corresponded"|FALSE
12242|"with her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, and"|FALSE
12242|"brought away the impression of something as unique and remote as"|FALSE
12242|"Undine or Mignon or Thekla."|FALSE
12242|"This selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of her"|FALSE
12242|"personal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It is"|FALSE
12242|"believed that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages a"|FALSE
12242|"quality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than of"|FALSE
12242|"anything to be elsewhere found,--flashes of wholly original and"|FALSE
12242|"profound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibiting"|FALSE
12242|"an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yet"|FALSE
12242|"often set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They are"|FALSE
12242|"here published as they were written, with very few and superficial"|FALSE
12242|"changes; although it is fair to say that the titles have been"|FALSE
12242|"assigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases these"|FALSE
12242|"verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with"|FALSE
12242|"rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and"|FALSE
12242|"a fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in the"|FALSE
12242|"few poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder at"|FALSE
12242|"the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can"|FALSE
12242|"delineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mental"|FALSE
12242|"struggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,"|FALSE
12242|"sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making the"|FALSE
12242|"reader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of these"|FALSE
12242|"poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with an"|FALSE
12242|"uneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but really"|FALSE
12242|"unsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one's"|FALSE
12242|"breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskin"|FALSE
12242|"wrote in his earlier and better days, \"No weight nor mass nor beauty"|FALSE
12242|"of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought.\""|FALSE

12242|"TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE"|FALSE
12242|"As is well documented, Emily Dickinson's poems were edited in these"|FALSE

12242|"PREFACE"|FALSE
12242|"The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's"|FALSE
12242|"poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern"|FALSE
12242|"artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the"|FALSE
12242|"qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest"|FALSE
12242|"themes,--life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch,\""|FALSE
12242|"as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very"|FALSE
12242|"core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as"|FALSE
12242|"it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling"|FALSE
12242|"power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to"|FALSE
12242|"form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties."|FALSE
12242|"Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending"|FALSE
12242|"occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of"|FALSE
12242|"her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend \"H.H.\""|FALSE
12242|"must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th"|FALSE
12242|"September, 1884, she wrote:--"|FALSE
12242|"MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses"|FALSE
12242|"you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \"day and"|FALSE
12242|"generation\" that you will not give them light."|FALSE
12242|"If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive"|FALSE
12242|"you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee"|FALSE
12242|"and executor. Surely after you are what is called"|FALSE
12242|"\"dead\" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you"|FALSE
12242|"have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your"|FALSE
12242|"verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think"|FALSE
12242|"we have a right to withhold from the world a word or"|FALSE
12242|"a thought any more than a deed which might help a"|FALSE
12242|"single soul. . . ."|FALSE
12242|"                Truly yours,"|FALSE
12242|"                        HELEN JACKSON."|FALSE
12242|"The \"portfolios\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,"|FALSE
12242|"by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had"|FALSE
12242|"been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little"|FALSE
12242|"fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear"|FALSE
12242|"evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had"|FALSE
12242|"received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of"|FALSE
12242|"rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and"|FALSE
12242|"phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one"|FALSE
12242|"form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without"|FALSE
12242|"important exception, her friends have generously placed at the"|FALSE
12242|"disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and"|FALSE
12242|"these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several"|FALSE
12242|"renderings of the same verse."|FALSE
12242|"To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been"|FALSE
12242|"subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They"|FALSE
12242|"should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and"|FALSE
12242|"suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some"|FALSE
12242|"time in the finished picture."|FALSE
12242|"Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the"|FALSE
12242|"winter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the"|FALSE
12242|"April following, she says, \"I made no verse, but one or two, until"|FALSE
12242|"this winter.\""|FALSE
12242|"The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running"|FALSE
12242|"Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in"|FALSE
12242|"breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her"|FALSE
12242|"latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its"|FALSE
12242|"fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,"|FALSE
12242|"everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous"|FALSE
12242|"dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of"|FALSE
12242|"a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and"|FALSE
12242|"strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of"|FALSE
12242|"the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,"|FALSE
12242|"the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general"|FALSE
12242|"chronologic accuracy."|FALSE
12242|"As a rule, the verses were without titles; but \"A Country Burial,\""|FALSE
12242|"\"A Thunder-Storm,\" \"The Humming-Bird,\" and a few others were named"|FALSE
12242|"by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the"|FALSE
12242|"accompanying note, if sent to a friend."|FALSE
12242|"The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in"|FALSE
12242|"pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of"|FALSE
12242|"responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not"|FALSE
12242|"absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her"|FALSE
12242|"rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it"|FALSE
12242|"seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and"|FALSE
12242|"more usual rhymes."|FALSE
